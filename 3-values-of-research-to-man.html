Abstract​)ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PURPOSESWhat I know:1.B 4.A2.D 5.B3.C 6.AWhat’s New:obesity, poverty, climate change, drugs, bullyingWhat’s More:1.The issue is about how technology has changed people’s lives, behavior and moral outlook.The writer’s stand: He is not against technological developments in fact it improves man’s way of living, but he also reminds us that same technology will advance evil and harm. Therefore, use technology wisely for the common good.2. At the comfort of technological products man has found his comfort zone to dwell and slowly forgetting the value of real human interactions that eventually changes man’s mind, culture and outlook in life.3. Personal experienceReal-life scenario happening around4. The author reiterates his stand about the issue and leave a strong statement for a call to action.What I have Learned: I thought that figures of speech are tools that writers use to create images, or paint pictures, in the mind.I learned that I need to study hard in my module and I was surprised that I need to answer it directly and properly, thanks all of the teachers to give this lesson.What I can do: ( no answers )Lesson 2What’s More: (no answers)What I have Learned:POSITION PAPERCHOSEN ISSUE» Has the covid19 pandemic changed the world for its best or for its worst?TITLE» The Devastating Effects of COVID 19 Pandemic «ANSWERPosition: The Covid19 pandemic changed the world for its worstThe world these past 7 months, is experiencing one of the darkest times of its dense history because of the abrupt existence of a very detrimental COVID19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) that originated in Wuhan, China, due to human negligence and lack of sanitation.This virus is very much contagious, that is why it became a global epidemic (occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people) in just 3 months! The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                                            Directions: Read the Excerpt of Emma Watson's Speech on Gender Equality at the United Nations and produce an evaluative statement 1. I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women six months ago. The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. How do you react to the first paragraph 2. When I was eight, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on our parents. When at 14. I started to be sexualized by certain media elements. At 15. my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they didn't want to appear masculine. At 18. my male friends were unable to express their feelings. Do you have the same experience with the author in this paragraph? Either yes or no, share your own experience 3. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, (women's expression is) seen as strong, aggressive, isolating and anti-men, unattractive even... Men, I would like to give you this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date. I've seen my father's role as a parent being valued less by society. I've seen young men who have a mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. Suicide is the biggest killer of men in the UK between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I've seen men fragile and insecure from what constitutes male success.

                                            Emma Watson's Speech on Gender Equality at the UN(an excerpt)"I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women 6 months ago. The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women’s rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism by definition is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes.When I was 8, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on for our parents. When at 14, I started to be sexualized by certain elements of  the media. At 15, my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they  didn’t want to appear masculine. At 18, my male friends were unable to express their feelings. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, [women’s expression is] seen as too strong, too aggressive, isolating, and anti-men, unattractive even…Men, I would like to give this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date, I’ve seen my father’s role as a parent being valued less by society. I’ve seen young men suffering from mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. In fact, in the UK, suicide is the biggest killer of men between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I’ve seen men fragile and insecure by what constitutes male success. Men don’t have the benefits of equality, either... If you believe in equality, you might be one of the inadvertent feminists I spoke of earlier and for this I applaud you. We must strive for a united world but the good news is we have a platform. It is called HeForShe. I invite you to step forward, to be seen and I ask yourself: if not me, who? If not now, when? Thank you."SHARING YOUR VIEWS. Based on the excerpt that you have read from activity 2, share your views on the following questions: 1. What part of the excerpt do you agree? Give reasons.2.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

                            7. Directions: Read the Excerpt of Emma Watson's Speech on Gender Equality at the United Nations and produce an evaluative statement 1. I was appointed as Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women six months ago. The more I spoke about feminism, the more I realized that fighting for women's rights has too often become synonymous with man-hating. If there is one thing I know for certain is that this has to stop. For the record, feminism is the belief that men and women should have equal rights and opportunities. It is the theory of political, economic, and social equality of the sexes. How do you react to the first paragraph 2. When I was eight, I was called bossy because I wanted to direct a play we would put on our parents. When at 14. I started to be sexualized by certain media elements. At 15. my girlfriends started dropping out of sports teams because they didn't want to appear masculine. At 18. my male friends were unable to express their feelings. Do you have the same experience with the author in this paragraph? Either yes or no, share your own experience 3. I decided that I was a feminist. This seemed uncomplicated to me. But my recent research has shown me that feminism has become an unpopular word. Women are choosing not to identify as feminists. Apparently, (women's expression is) seen as strong, aggressive, isolating and anti-men, unattractive even... Men, I would like to give you this opportunity to extend your formal invitation. Gender equality is your issue, too. Because to date. I've seen my father's role as a parent being valued less by society. I've seen young men who have a mental illness, unable to ask for help for fear it would make them less of a man. Suicide is the biggest killer of men in the UK between 20 to 49, eclipsing road accidents, cancer, and heart disease. I've seen men fragile and insecure from what constitutes male success. Men don't have the benefits of equality either. In paragraphs three and four, what statements show agreeable and convincible? Why?​</h2><br />
