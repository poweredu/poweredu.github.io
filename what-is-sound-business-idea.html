As early as now, practice your duties as a citizen by using your right to vote
wisely through critical analysis. Look at the speech excerpts of the mayoralty
candidates below.
QUESTION: How will you help jobless people?
It is a great issue as far as daily living is concerned. The cause
is either oversupply of workers or the recession due to the pandemic.
For this reason, the local government must provide retraining courses
for the jobless so that they can obtain or improve their skills. In doing
#1
so, they can match up with the demand of the industries.
Elf
To reduce unemployment, we should tap the cooperation of the
business firms through subsidies. Granting that the city's income can
support, subsidies can help both the firms and the workers.
Companies will hire workers as their production cost will lessen since
there is financial backing from the local government.
#2
Ensuring sustainable economic growth should be the long-term
solution to unemployment. Economic stability guarantees investors
and industries to operate businesses and hire employees. Well, yes, it
is challenging to do this, but the results are clear. Only by this way can
people forget their worries of where to get earnings.

As early as now, practice your duties as a citizen by using your right to vote
wisely through critical analysis. Look at the speech excerpts of the mayoralty
candidates below.
QUESTION: How will you help jobless people?
It is a great issue as far as daily living is concerned. The cause
is either oversupply of workers or the recession due to the pandemic.
For this reason, the local government must provide retraining courses
for the jobless so that they can obtain or improve their skills. In doing
#1
so, they can match up with the demand of the industries.
Elf
To reduce unemployment, we should tap the cooperation of the
business firms through subsidies. Granting that the city's income can
support, subsidies can help both the firms and the workers.
Companies will hire workers as their production cost will lessen since
there is financial backing from the local government.
#2
Ensuring sustainable economic growth should be the long-term
solution to unemployment. Economic stability guarantees investors
and industries to operate businesses and hire employees. Well, yes, it
is challenging to do this, but the results are clear. Only by this way can
people forget their worries of where to get earnings.
