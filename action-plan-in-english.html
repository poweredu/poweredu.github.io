The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which triggered a global pandemic at a confounding pace has affected the whole world. Following the emergence of the novel coronavirus and its spread outside China, countries like the Philippines are experiencing the deadly virus’ life-threatening and chilling socio-economic impacts. From the first three imported COVID-19 cases in January, the infection rate in the Philippines has grown rapidly because of localized transmissions totaling 15,588 cases with 11,069 active cases as of 28 May, 2020. There have been 921 deaths and 3,598 recoveries so far. Among all ASEAN member states, the Philippines occupies third spot in terms of the highest number of COVID-19 cases. In the world, out of the 215 countries affected by the pandemic, the Philippines is placed 43rd as of 28 May, 2020, according to World meter, a reference website that provides counters and real-time statistics on diverse topics.  In response to the outbreak, the government of the Philippine launched a multi-sectorial response to the COVID-19 pandemic through its Interagency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases chaired by the Department of Health (DOH). For almost three months now, the Philippine government has adopted a suppression strategy through the use of non-pharmaceutical health (NPH) measures (i.e. social distancing, wearing of face masks, quarantines, etc.) to control the spread of the virus in the country. These measures are embodied in the Philippine Government’s National Action Plan (NAP) Against COVID-19 strategic framework, which includes strategies such as TASK FORCE T3 (Test, Trace and Treat) and PDITRA or Prevention, Detection, Isolation, Reintegration, and Adopting the New Normal Program. ( NASA PIC.

Abstract​)ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PURPOSESWhat I know:1.B 4.A2.D 5.B3.C 6.AWhat’s New:obesity, poverty, climate change, drugs, bullyingWhat’s More:1.The issue is about how technology has changed people’s lives, behavior and moral outlook.The writer’s stand: He is not against technological developments in fact it improves man’s way of living, but he also reminds us that same technology will advance evil and harm. Therefore, use technology wisely for the common good.2. At the comfort of technological products man has found his comfort zone to dwell and slowly forgetting the value of real human interactions that eventually changes man’s mind, culture and outlook in life.3.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that your opinion is valid and defensible.

The novel coronavirus, COVID-19, which triggered a global pandemic at a confounding pace has affected the whole world. Following the emergence of the novel coronavirus and its spread outside China, countries like the Philippines are experiencing the deadly virus’ life-threatening and chilling socio-economic impacts. From the first three imported COVID-19 cases in January, the infection rate in the Philippines has grown rapidly because of localized transmissions totaling 15,588 cases with 11,069 active cases as of 28 May, 2020. There have been 921 deaths and 3,598 recoveries so far. Among all ASEAN member states, the Philippines occupies third spot in terms of the highest number of COVID-19 cases. In the world, out of the 215 countries affected by the pandemic, the Philippines is placed 43rd as of 28 May, 2020, according to World meter, a reference website that provides counters and real-time statistics on diverse topics.  In response to the outbreak, the government of the Philippine launched a multi-sectorial response to the COVID-19 pandemic through its Interagency Task Force (IATF) on Emerging Infectious Diseases chaired by the Department of Health (DOH). For almost three months now, the Philippine government has adopted a suppression strategy through the use of non-pharmaceutical health (NPH) measures (i.e. social distancing, wearing of face masks, quarantines, etc.) to control the spread of the virus in the country. These measures are embodied in the Philippine Government’s National Action Plan (NAP) Against COVID-19 strategic framework, which includes strategies such as TASK FORCE T3 (Test, Trace and Treat) and PDITRA or Prevention, Detection, Isolation, Reintegration, and Adopting the New Normal Program. ( NASA PIC.

Eventually we also need to understand if you already gave a chance to a person you're with but broke that chance because of someone or maybe its not to late to recover and let them go, i think divorcement is a must. It doesn't mean you moved on you need to give them another chance to be with you again.Shakespeare is genius, we can usually know that he is best in English and i know he can do best.Time is gold, remember every seconds, ever minutes or even every hour time is something to us, Time relates our feelings and not to the Clock.True, Life is just like the world it gets old but never ends.<p></p><p>Hope this helps.</p><p>//typographical errors and Grammatical mistakes. </p><br />

Abstract​)ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PURPOSESWhat I know:1.B 4.A2.D 5.B3.C 6.AWhat’s New:obesity, poverty, climate change, drugs, bullyingWhat’s More:1.The issue is about how technology has changed people’s lives, behavior and moral outlook.The writer’s stand: He is not against technological developments in fact it improves man’s way of living, but he also reminds us that same technology will advance evil and harm. Therefore, use technology wisely for the common good.2. At the comfort of technological products man has found his comfort zone to dwell and slowly forgetting the value of real human interactions that eventually changes man’s mind, culture and outlook in life.3.

The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue. The goal of a position paper is to convince the audience that your opinion is valid and defensible. Ideas that you are considering need to be carefully examined in choosing a topic, developing your argument, and organizing your paper.2.
