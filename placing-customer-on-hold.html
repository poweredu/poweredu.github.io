                                            1. The same airline company has a different model commuter airplane that can hold up to 90 passengers. The plane flies a single route and charges passengers $320 for a one-way fare. Fares are 100% refundable if the passenger cancels up to 10 days prior to the flight. The fixed cost (the cost that does not change with the number of passengers, such as crew salaries, airport fees, etc) for every flight is $1, 500. The variable cost (the additional cost per passenger) for every flight is $160 per passenger. Create a spreadsheet that calculates the total profit per flight based on the number of passengers on the plane. Considering that all passengers went on the flight or canceled prior to the 10 days of the flight, with how many passengers will the flight break even? HINT: A. Create a column of ”Total number of passengers”, put in values 1 through 90. B. The next column would be ”Variable Cost”. C. The third column would be ”Total Cost” which is the ”Variable Cost” plus ”Fixed Cost”. D. The fourth column would be the” Revenue” column which is ”Total number of passengers”∗$320. E. The fifth column would be the”Profit” column which simply is the”Revenue” column minus the ”Total Cost” column.2. Because they have a full refund policy, it is common for customers not to show up. Thus, to minimize the number of sudden cancellations, the company adopted a new policy wherein if the cancellation is done within 10 days of the flight, only 90% of the amount will be refunded. Say the flight was initially fully booked, but there were 10 late cancellations that are to be refunded 90% of their original fare, what would the flight’s total profit be? 3. If 80 tickets are sold, the number of passengers expected to cancel within 10 days of the flight can be approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 0.75. Therefore, if the airline sells 80 tickets for the flight, what is the probability that the flight will only have 69 passengers (assuming everyone else who bought a ticket and did not cancel within the 10 days will push through with the flight)? Enter your answer as a decimal probability (not a percent) rounded to 4 decimal places. 4. Using the same distribution as the previous question, there is a 0.20 probability that the flight will have how many late cancellations? Please round your answer to the nearest integer. 5. Say the flight will offer complimentary in-flight snacks. Wanting to minimize spoilage, they only prepare exactly the same amount of food as was originally booked on the flight. Continuing with the same distribution as 3 and 4, what is the probability that less than 90% of the snacks will be consumed? Enter your answer as a decimal probability (not a percent) rounded to 4 decimal places. 6. If the flight is sold-out, the number of passengers expected to show up can be approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 78 and a standard deviation of 5. What is the probability that the flight will have at least 84 passengers? 7. Continuing on the previous questions, company statistics show that of the passengers who do not push through with the flight, 40% would be refunded fully, while the remaining passengers would incur the penalty for late cancellations. Considering this, how much would the flight’s profit amount to?</a>

                            10. 1. The same airline company has a different model commuter airplane that can hold up to 90 passengers. The plane flies a single route and charges passengers $320 for a one-way fare. Fares are 100% refundable if the passenger cancels up to 10 days prior to the flight. The fixed cost (the cost that does not change with the number of passengers, such as crew salaries, airport fees, etc) for every flight is $1, 500. The variable cost (the additional cost per passenger) for every flight is $160 per passenger. Create a spreadsheet that calculates the total profit per flight based on the number of passengers on the plane. Considering that all passengers went on the flight or canceled prior to the 10 days of the flight, with how many passengers will the flight break even? HINT: A. Create a column of ”Total number of passengers”, put in values 1 through 90. B. The next column would be ”Variable Cost”. C. The third column would be ”Total Cost” which is the ”Variable Cost” plus ”Fixed Cost”. D. The fourth column would be the” Revenue” column which is ”Total number of passengers”∗$320. E. The fifth column would be the”Profit” column which simply is the”Revenue” column minus the ”Total Cost” column.2. Because they have a full refund policy, it is common for customers not to show up. Thus, to minimize the number of sudden cancellations, the company adopted a new policy wherein if the cancellation is done within 10 days of the flight, only 90% of the amount will be refunded. Say the flight was initially fully booked, but there were 10 late cancellations that are to be refunded 90% of their original fare, what would the flight’s total profit be? 3. If 80 tickets are sold, the number of passengers expected to cancel within 10 days of the flight can be approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 10 and a standard deviation of 0.75. Therefore, if the airline sells 80 tickets for the flight, what is the probability that the flight will only have 69 passengers (assuming everyone else who bought a ticket and did not cancel within the 10 days will push through with the flight)? Enter your answer as a decimal probability (not a percent) rounded to 4 decimal places. 4. Using the same distribution as the previous question, there is a 0.20 probability that the flight will have how many late cancellations? Please round your answer to the nearest integer. 5. Say the flight will offer complimentary in-flight snacks. Wanting to minimize spoilage, they only prepare exactly the same amount of food as was originally booked on the flight. Continuing with the same distribution as 3 and 4, what is the probability that less than 90% of the snacks will be consumed? Enter your answer as a decimal probability (not a percent) rounded to 4 decimal places. 6. If the flight is sold-out, the number of passengers expected to show up can be approximated by a normal distribution with a mean of 78 and a standard deviation of 5. What is the probability that the flight will have at least 84 passengers? 7. Continuing on the previous questions, company statistics show that of the passengers who do not push through with the flight, 40% would be refunded fully, while the remaining passengers would incur the penalty for late cancellations. Considering this, how much would the flight’s profit amount to?</h2><br />
