powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed 
going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led 
her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </a>

                                            inequality in one variable. History of Carmona In the late 16th century, a Spanish colonial resettlement program was implemented across wide areas of what came to be known as the province of (EXAMPLE) CAVITE. The program was designed to integrate the Filipinos into the religious and political institutions of the Spaniards. (1)__________ was first established as a mission town in 1595. Together with the other mission towns in the province, it became one of the centers of religious and economic activities in the first centuries of Spanish colonial rule. Carmona used to be a barrio of the Mission Town of Silang. It was locally known as "(2)_____________ "", a tagalog word for plain" due to the numerous hills and plains in the area. At that time, this barrio was just a small farming community with a very small population. As its population rapidly increased, religious and political separation from the town of Silang was later sought from Spain. Eventually, it became an independent municipality on February 20, 1857 by virtue of the Royal Decree issued by the King of Spain through Governor General Fernando de (5)__________ The name (3_______) was adopted as a sign of gratitude to the Spanish officials who influenced the Central Government at the time of separation of the barrio. With boundaries properly delineated and a church established, it started its own religious and political administration. The people of Carmona have actively participated in the revolution against the Spaniards. It also witnessed the Filipinos' resistance against the Japanese forces. During the Japanese occupation, some of Carmona's prominent houses were used as Japanese headquarters while the hills became the stronghold of Filipino revolutionaries After the war, Carmona started to find its path towards economic and political stabilization. During this period, the provision of a stable means of livelihood for all the people became top priority. Since Carmona was basically agricultural, the communal agricultural lands were offered to the farmers for cultivation through lottery. This practice, held every three years, was locally known as "(4)__________ ". Since then, it has been embedded into the municipality's traditional procedures on lanc ownership. To this day, farm lots are being raffled off to interested farmers, lucky winners are awarded the right to till and develop a certain section of the communal lands. This traditional practice defuses agrarian unrest and decreases tensions or land conflicts.​</a>

Mahayana Buddhism
In the previous lesson, we have learned What according to the Buddha, the path to happiness starts from an understanding of the root cause of suffering. Just like a physician who diagnosed the sickness of human persons as "suffering" due to "craving," the Buddha prescribes a proactive course of treatment for the "sick" person through "Dharma." Part of the "treatment" is the "Eight-fold Path" which the "sick" person must practice through mindful thought and action. In this lesson, we shall discover another form of Buddhism which also originated from the teachings and examples of the Buddha but has taken a different course.</a>

her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful 
and unusual sights greeted her eyes.
As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, “Where do you come 
from, most beautiful one?” Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though 
fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking 
courage she answered, “I am Luna, daughter of the sun god.” The young man smiled at her and answered, “I 
am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom.” 
Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell. When it was time for 
Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They 
continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other. 
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so 
happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, 
reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter’s disobedience to the immortal 
laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. 
Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden 
chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time 
Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. It is Mar trying to escape from his cave,” they say. </h2><br />

Isang araw natagpuan niya ang kanyang sarili na tumahak sa ibang landas na humantong</p><p>sa labas ng kanyang kaharian.

Gusto niyang tumakas, ngunit nang muli siyang tumingin sa kanya, nakita niyang nakangiti ito sa kanya. Pagkuha</p><p>lakas ng loob niyang sumagot, "Ako si Luna, anak ng diyos ng araw."

Kapag oras na para sa</p><p>Luna to go, nangakong magkikita sila nang madalas hangga't maaari, dahil marami pa silang kwento sila</p><p>Nagpatuloy ang pagkikita sa iisang lugar hanggang sa napagtanto nilang in love na sila sa isa't isa.</p><p>Isang araw pagkatapos ng isa sa kanilang mga lihim na pagkikita, bumalik si Luna sa langit na puno ng kagalakan. Siya ay gayon</p><p>masaya na sinabi niya ang sikreto niya sa isa niyang pinsan. Ang pinsan, naninibugho sa kanyang kagandahan at kanyang kaligayahan, iniulat ang relasyon sa diyos ng araw. Nagalit ang diyos ng araw sa pagsuway ng kanyang anak sa imortal</p><p>mga batas. Isinara niya siya sa kanilang hardin at hindi siya pinayagang makalabas. Pagkatapos ay umuwi siyang malungkot. Sa tuwing naaalala niya si Mar, nagmamadali siyang lumabas sa ginto</p><p>kalesa patungo sa tagpuan sa pag-asang makita siyang muli. Ang mga mangingisda sa labas ng dagat ay naniniwala na sa bawat oras</p><p>Lumilitaw si Luna, ang buwan, nagugulo ang dagat. Si Mar ang sumusubok na tumakas sa kanyang kweba,” sabi nila.</p><br />

Mahayana Buddhism
In the previous lesson, we have learned What according to the Buddha, the path to happiness starts from an understanding of the root cause of suffering. Just like a physician who diagnosed the sickness of human persons as "suffering" due to "craving," the Buddha prescribes a proactive course of treatment for the "sick" person through "Dharma." Part of the "treatment" is the "Eight-fold Path" which the "sick" person must practice through mindful thought and action. In this lesson, we shall discover another form of Buddhism which also originated from the teachings and examples of the Buddha but has taken a different course.</h2><br />
