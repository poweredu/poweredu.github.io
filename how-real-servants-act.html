                            10. how can you be a servant leader at home?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Servant Leadership at Home</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The chapter and lesson this week about servant leadership reminded me of how much mother and fathers portray servant leadership in the home. According to Northouse, servant leadership has ten characteristics. They are; listening, empathy, healing, awareness, persuasion, conceptualization, foresight, stewardship, commitment, and building community (Northouse, 2013). For my home and my family I can easily relate all of these concepts to home servant leadership.
</p><p>
</p><p>Listening: I must listen to my husband and my kids. Communication is key to any good relationship. This can be awfully challenging some days when my husband is deployed, or on days where my kids are driving me bananas. I always try to make time for each family member everyday and ask them how there day is and talk about anything else on their mind.
</p><p>
</p><p>Empathy: Oh empathy! This has been a new lesson for me with a daughter on the brink of her teenage years! When my daughter comes to me and talks about her friend problems and drama I would really rather say “just get over it!” but I can’t. I have to show her empathy and I have to be patient with her. This is not an easy task… especially when you have a daughter who wants to be just like everyone else!
</p><p>
</p><p>Healing: A little over two years ago, we had a daughter who died from a rare terminal disease called Sandhoff disease. This disease took over our entire lives. Day in and day out we were taking care of her. After her death, our family needed to heal. I obviously struggled with this. My husband was a wonderful part in the healing aspect and he held my hand though all of it. Just like my husband was there for me, I had to be there for my other kids. Even two years later we are still grieving, but in a different way. We really took each other and made each other accountable for each other during that process.

</p><p>Awareness: As a mom, you have to be aware. Enough said!
</p><p>
</p><p>Persuasion: My persuasion skills have been on the rise lately! We recently just got orders from the military to move to Japan. We will be moving the first week in March. There are so many choice that need to be made. For instance, we have a 9000 lbs. weight limit. So we have been arguing over what is going to go and what is not going to go with us. My husband and I have been persuading each other on different topics. I think we need to sell our king size bed so we can bring our overstuffed living room furniture. He thinks we need to sell both of our cars. He wants to live off-base, I want to live on-base. I want to bring the dog (although it will cost around $3000) and he does not. Through all of the decisions that need to be made we have been attempting to make the best decisions for our family as a whole.
</p><p>
</p><p>Conceptualization: As a family, we must have goals. My husband and I have financial goals. For example, get out of debt, pay off the cars, buy a home 10 years from now. I want to have a career sometime in the next few years. My husband is studying for a promotion. My kids have goals. My son wants to be a better reader, my daughter wants to be in advanced placement classes. We all look to the future and support each other in our endeavors.
</p><p>
</p><p>Foresight: A mother always knows best. I help my kids make the best decisions based on my past mistakes.
</p><p>
</p><p>Stewardship: I show my kids by examples of what good stewardship is. I teach them to hold the door open for others, give elders their seat, and other good manners like that. I hope that one day they will raise their kids to be good stewards to this world.
</p><p>
</p><p>Commitment to Growth of People: I’m in the business of growing kids in my home! I am committed to them. I want to see them grow and become good and successful people in this world.
</p><p>
</p><p>Building Community: I teach my kids that helping others is a good thing. I think that our church helps with this a lot too. My daughter just went to the homeless shelter with her youth group the other day to help give food. We are a part of a small group in our church and we regularly do “service projects” where we help others. I think kids also build community by being a part of things that they enjoy. My son enjoys sports and my daughter enjoys the schools act club. But letting them do community projects I am allowing them to become their own “person” and identity</p><br />

                            21. Act about ”The Parable of the Three Servants”, (Mt. 25:14-30)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>nasan yung Sasagutan jan teh?</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Introduction</p><p>Jesus came to earth as the long-awaited Messiah to die on the cross for our salvation and for the redemption of humanity. He also came to establish the kingdom of God on the earth, which he saw as beginning small and somewhat unimpressive, like a mustard seed, but eventually blossoming to cover the entire earth. When teaching, Jesus often used indirect forms of communication that appealed to the imagination of people and provoked further thought. As a result, he often left his hearers puzzling and pondering over the implications of his message.</p><p></p><p>After entering Jerusalem the final time (Mt.21:1-11) and weeping over the city of Jerusalem for their refusal to accept him and his kingdom message (Mt.23:37-39), Jesus gave some final instructions to his disciples for the days ahead of them (Mt.24:1–25:46). Through a series of parables, Jesus warned them to be watchful, prepared, faithful and productive during this time. One of these parables was The Parable of the Talents or The Parable of the Three Servants.</p><p></p><p>The Parable of the Three Servants (Matthew 25:14-30)</p><p>This story moves along with a rhythm that creates a sense of expectation. But there is a twist at the end. The decreasing quantities of talents given (a ‘talent’ was a large amount of money) simply serve to build the story to a climax. Surely the one given the least would have the easiest time of all making good use of it. But, no! This third servant is not only severely reprimanded by the master; what he has is taken away and given to another. In many ways this story is a tragedy.</p><p></p><p>The parable raises many questions. Who is this ‘wicked and lazy servant?’ Is it a disciple or not? What is Jesus trying to say to his disciples … and to us? Is the end of life like a big final exam? Aren’t we saved by grace not by works? We know that God is loving and kind, but is he also hard and stern at times too? What does the parable tell us about God?</p><p></p><p>No doubt, the master is this story represents God and the servants represent various types of people and their response and relationship to God. In most parables, Jesus is endeavouring to teach his listeners a number of lessons. Let’s look at a few of them together.</p><p></p><p>Reflection #1: God entrusts each one of us with resources according to our ability</p><p>Like the master, God entrusts all people with a portion of his resources, expecting them to act as good managers. Notice that when the master left, he divided his assets and gave each of the three servants a different amount (5, 2, 1) and he did so in “proportion to their abilities (vs.15).”</p><p></p><p>Our resources include more than just our money, as in this parable. It includes all that we are and all that we have at our disposal (our time, talents, opportunities and our finances). God is a creative God. He doesn’t make clones. He makes unique individuals. Understand and accept how God has made you – your SHAPE. Don’t compare yourself with others. Take a stocktake of what you have been given by God. What’s in your hand? Your very life is a gift and an investment from God. Like the master in this parable, God believes in you and has confidence that you will manage his resources wisely and with an entrepreneurial spirit.</p><p></p><p>Reflection #2: God is pleased when we use and invest our resources</p><p>When the Master eventually returned there was a time of accountability for how each of the servants had used the money entrusted to them (vs.19). The first two servants immediately got to work, investing their money and over a period of time they earned 100% more (vs.16-17). They obviously felt good about their own efforts and the master responded with praise, commendation, celebration and reward (vs.21). Note that the servants were not treated in regards to the amount they had been given but for their faithfulness with what they had individually received (vs.21-23). They both received the identical statement of praise and joy from the master. What matters most is not what we have been given but what we do with it.</p><p></p><p>I believe that Jesus teaches that anything we do for the benefit of God and others is pleasing to God. That includes our work (whether paid or not), our love (acts of kindness towards all people), and our service (voluntarily helping others – anywhere). We can’t even give a cup of water to someone without God noticing it and rewarding it (Mk 9:41). That’s encouraging!</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><p>#CARRY ON LEARNING</p><p>at basahin nyo lang po</p><br />
