                                            No. XVIII. A terrorist group called the
Emerald Brigade is based in the State
Asyaland. The government of Asyaland does
not support the terrorist group, but being a
poor country, is powerless to stop it.
The Emerald Brigade launched an attack
on the Philippines firing two missiles that
killed thousands of Filipinos. It then
warned that more attacks were
forthcoming. Through diplomatic channels
the Philippines demanded that Asyaland
stop the Emerald Brigade; otherwise, it will
do whatever is necessary to defend itself.
Receiving reliable intelligence reports of
another imminent attack by the Emarld
Brigae, and it appearing that Asyaland was
incapable of preventing the assault, the
Philippines sent a crack commando team to
Asyaland. The team stayed only for a few
hours in Asyaland, succeeded in killing the
leaders and most of the members of the
Emerald Brigade, then immediately
returned to the Philippines.
(a) Was the Philippine action justified under
the international law principle of self-
defense? explain your answer (3%)
(b) As a consequence of the foregoing
incident, Asyaland charges the Philippines
with violation of Article 2.4 of the United
Nations Charter that prohibits "the threat
or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of any
State. The Philippines counters that its
commando team neither took any territory
nor interfered in the political processes of
Asyaland. Which contention is correct?
Reasons (3%)
(c) Assume that the commando team
captured a member of the Emerald Brigade
and brought him back to th Philippines.
The Philippine Government insists that a
special international tribunal should try the
terrorist. On the other hand, the terrorist
argues that terrorism is not an
international crime and, therefore, the
municipal laws of the Philippines, which
recognize access of the accused to
constitutional rights, should apply. Decide
with reasons. (3%)</a>

                            5. No. XVIII. A terrorist group called the
Emerald Brigade is based in the State
Asyaland. The government of Asyaland does
not support the terrorist group, but being a
poor country, is powerless to stop it.
The Emerald Brigade launched an attack
on the Philippines firing two missiles that
killed thousands of Filipinos. It then
warned that more attacks were
forthcoming. Through diplomatic channels
the Philippines demanded that Asyaland
stop the Emerald Brigade; otherwise, it will
do whatever is necessary to defend itself.
Receiving reliable intelligence reports of
another imminent attack by the Emarld
Brigae, and it appearing that Asyaland was
incapable of preventing the assault, the
Philippines sent a crack commando team to
Asyaland. The team stayed only for a few
hours in Asyaland, succeeded in killing the
leaders and most of the members of the
Emerald Brigade, then immediately
returned to the Philippines.
(a) Was the Philippine action justified under
the international law principle of self-
defense? explain your answer (3%)
(b) As a consequence of the foregoing
incident, Asyaland charges the Philippines
with violation of Article 2.4 of the United
Nations Charter that prohibits "the threat
or use of force against the territorial
integrity or political independence of any
State. The Philippines counters that its
commando team neither took any territory
nor interfered in the political processes of
Asyaland. Which contention is correct?
Reasons (3%)
(c) Assume that the commando team
captured a member of the Emerald Brigade
and brought him back to th Philippines.
The Philippine Government insists that a
special international tribunal should try the
terrorist. On the other hand, the terrorist
argues that terrorism is not an
international crime and, therefore, the
municipal laws of the Philippines, which
recognize access of the accused to
constitutional rights, should apply. Decide
with reasons. (3%)</h2><br />
