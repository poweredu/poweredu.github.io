                                            The concept of fairness is central to understanding plagiarism. Fairness means being fair both to yourself and others blank , everybody both gives and receives their proper due, and nobody has anything to complain about. blank , an incident involving unfairness could be taking someone else’s work and passing it off as your own. blank , the person whose work has been taken receives no recognition or acknowledgment for their research and thinking. blank , writers who plagiarize are not being fair to themselves either because they are not developing their own independent academic skills. blank , students who do their own work with due acknowledgement of the work of others should develop their own academic skills and self- confidence far more than those who merely misuse the work of others.</a>

                                            PA HELP POActivity 3. Empower yourself (Reading activity) The Greeks formulated the word politics during the 4th and 5th century. Politics was inseparable in the life in the polis or a place of state shared by a certain group of people. This concept of politics is as old as the first organization created by man. According to Aristotle and Plato, humans are not self-sufficingso they find the need to come together as a community. From this union comes the need for politics and governance to maintain order within a society. Social contract theories like Thoma Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rouseau, and john Locke during the 17th and 18th century in Europe stressed the hypothetical state of nature that was devoid of any kind of government. This state of nature is often violentand chaotic, therefore, people enter themselves into a social contract or a written or unwritten binding agreement among the people that bids for the creation of government and the consequent use of politics for the achievment of peace and order (Baradat 1997). Political sciences is the academic discipline that deals with the key issues and concepts in politics. Niccolo Machiavelli is widely accepted as the father of modern political science because of his discussion on maintaining power in his books The prince and Discourses. But even before Mahiavelli, both palto and Aristotle had already provided broad discussions on the central concepts in politics such as the concept of justice( What and who is morally and politilically right), power( source of authority), the right types of constitutions and governments( different types of government and states), political structures(different ideologies in a state), right and virtuous leadership( who should lead in a certain political system), (Curtis 1981). Key fields in politics include power relations in society, forms of government, political behavior and with the culttural turn of the 20th century, the inclusion of political culture and the civil society's role in government. While politics deals with power in society in general, governance specifically deals with power in governmentand how this institution exerts power for the benefits of the society. Today, the discussion of politics and governance in political science has been divided in different fields of interests, namely, political theory, political methodology, comparative politics, international relations and law( Roskin et al. 2007​</a>

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the following carefully. Write T if the statementis true and if the statement is false.1. Critique or review is a genre of academic writing which briefly summarizes andcritically evaluates a work or concept.2. Writing a critique on a work helps us to develop a fault-finding ability within one'sself.3. Critiques can be used to carefully analyze a variety of works such as novels,exhibite, film, images, poetry, monographs, journal articles, systematic reviews, theories,news reports, feature articles, and the like.4. Critical approaches sometimes called lenses, are different perspectives we canconsider when looking at a piece or several pieces of work.5. Feminism examines a literary work in terms of its form and lernents likecharacters, setting, plot, point-of-view, theme, symbolism, figures of speech, etc.6. Pormalism focuses on socio-economic status or on the unequal distribution ofwealth and resources between rich and poor.7. Reader response approach focuses on the discrimination, unequal treatment, andprejudices of women in the society,8. Marxism approach allows the writer to give his or her own assumptions orreactions on the event seen or article read.9. The purpose of critical approaches is to help us answer questions, as well ashelping us interpret and understand a variety of works.10. One of the reasons in writing critique is to recognize the strengths andweaknesses of the work.​</a>

                            22. PA HELP POActivity 3. Empower yourself (Reading activity) The Greeks formulated the word politics during the 4th and 5th century. Politics was inseparable in the life in the polis or a place of state shared by a certain group of people. This concept of politics is as old as the first organization created by man. According to Aristotle and Plato, humans are not self-sufficingso they find the need to come together as a community. From this union comes the need for politics and governance to maintain order within a society. Social contract theories like Thoma Hobbes, Jean-Jacques Rouseau, and john Locke during the 17th and 18th century in Europe stressed the hypothetical state of nature that was devoid of any kind of government. This state of nature is often violentand chaotic, therefore, people enter themselves into a social contract or a written or unwritten binding agreement among the people that bids for the creation of government and the consequent use of politics for the achievment of peace and order (Baradat 1997). Political sciences is the academic discipline that deals with the key issues and concepts in politics. Niccolo Machiavelli is widely accepted as the father of modern political science because of his discussion on maintaining power in his books The prince and Discourses. But even before Mahiavelli, both palto and Aristotle had already provided broad discussions on the central concepts in politics such as the concept of justice( What and who is morally and politilically right), power( source of authority), the right types of constitutions and governments( different types of government and states), political structures(different ideologies in a state), right and virtuous leadership( who should lead in a certain political system), (Curtis 1981). Key fields in politics include power relations in society, forms of government, political behavior and with the culttural turn of the 20th century, the inclusion of political culture and the civil society's role in government. While politics deals with power in society in general, governance specifically deals with power in governmentand how this institution exerts power for the benefits of the society. Today, the discussion of politics and governance in political science has been divided in different fields of interests, namely, political theory, political methodology, comparative politics, international relations and law( Roskin et al. 2007​</h2><br />

                            23. DIRECTIONS: Read the following carefully. Write T if the statementis true and if the statement is false.1. Critique or review is a genre of academic writing which briefly summarizes andcritically evaluates a work or concept.2. Writing a critique on a work helps us to develop a fault-finding ability within one'sself.3. Critiques can be used to carefully analyze a variety of works such as novels,exhibite, film, images, poetry, monographs, journal articles, systematic reviews, theories,news reports, feature articles, and the like.4. Critical approaches sometimes called lenses, are different perspectives we canconsider when looking at a piece or several pieces of work.5. Feminism examines a literary work in terms of its form and lernents likecharacters, setting, plot, point-of-view, theme, symbolism, figures of speech, etc.6. Pormalism focuses on socio-economic status or on the unequal distribution ofwealth and resources between rich and poor.7. Reader response approach focuses on the discrimination, unequal treatment, andprejudices of women in the society,8. Marxism approach allows the writer to give his or her own assumptions orreactions on the event seen or article read.9. The purpose of critical approaches is to help us answer questions, as well ashelping us interpret and understand a variety of works.10. One of the reasons in writing critique is to recognize the strengths andweaknesses of the work.​</h2><br />
