                                              Why should life be fair to you? The fact that you are reading this, means you have food to eat, access to shelter, clothing, access to a computer and internet which approximately means you have some edge over some people around the world that has one thought — food.A lot of people complain about how life is unfair and how things went bad in their life. But hey, life was meant to be so, you just have to embrace it and not take it as the cake you can always have.You don’t expect life to be fair to you because you are a good person or you work so hard. Life has its own rules, it’s complicated and not the same for everyone.  If you tried once and failed then definitely you will discover that life is unfair. Life was not intended for those who try only once then give up but instead, it’s orchestrated for the determined and strong-minded people who keep trying until they get what they want.  Because life isn’t fair doesn’t mean you should give up and keep asking why. Life is a never-ending race of learning. When bad things happen to you (or when something good doesn’t happen to you every time), it may not just be something bad happening to you. It might be a chance to learn something new — about yourself, about the way the world works, the people around you which would propel you to a new level.​</a>

                                            Life feels like a massive rehearsal for every person you have to talk to, for every situation you have to attend,which just falls apart into wild swings of arrogance and timidity.Growing up didn't help with the awkwardness. There were just so many opportunities lost because I justcould not get what was before me - how I should react to it or deal with it.But growing up helped with coping. Even when an interaction is just a pile of your actions shattering into"Huh?" or "What?" or that other person's stare of bewilderment with matching eyebrows raised the best wayto deal with it is to not dwell on it too much.You are doing fine even when you are all over the place, because the mistakes you earn and the memories ofembarrassments past help in some way to try again and get it right with the right person.[...] And what growing up taught me most is that people come and go; what matters is the memories you hadwith them when they stayed You are the constant in this coming and going, so what will always matter is thatyou become a better person than yourself, and that you find mearing in all this clumsy struggling. You justhave to build value, either through becoming more well-adjusted or just becoming more skilled or justkeeping yourself going through the day.Excerpt from The Awkward Years by Ace Alba+1. in which paragraph expresses the main idea that encounter and engagement with people seems like a trialand error experience?A. paragraph 1B. paragraph 2C. paragraph 4D. paragraph 52.Which statement best summarizes the passage?A Entering adulthood is a time when people charge mistake as learning and deal with all sorts of uneasinessin one's lifeB.

                            1. Possible Threats that can ruin a family:(already answered)InsultsGossipDeception and liesFailure to accept differencesNo forgivenessWays and Means to overcome these problems:__________________________________________________Write at least 5 Ways and Means. The lines are too short. Just write examples. Thank you for helping. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Insults and Criticism</p><p>Words carry weight. In some cases they can carry the weight of the world. When unkind words are said to family, they hurt. Your family is supposed to be your source of encouragement and support. Negative words damage the core of family relationships. Some family members may say things off the cuff and think that because these things were said casually, they don’t hurt the other person. The truth is that such words hurt, however they are said. When negative words are spoken to family members it creates a chasm in the relationship. It takes time and positive interactions to repair the harm that is done when insults, criticisms, and jabs take place.</p><p>When there is any outpouring of these negative words to a family member the chasm can grow so great that it can almost seem beyond repair. Any relationship can be resolved with apologies and forgiveness, but the hurt can still remain long after words are exchanged. Be careful with your words. Remind yourself that as family you are there to be one another’s greatest supporters in life. Tearing others in the family down with words is destructive to the family unit. Keep the old adage in mind when speaking to your family “if you don’t have something nice to say, don’t say anything at all”.</p><p>2. Gossip</p><p>Gossip is very damaging. Most often gossip occurs when someone is upset by something related to the person they are gossiping about. It may make a person feel better temporarily, but in the end it does not solve the problem as the gossip itself is certainly not done out of kindness or love. If you have a problem or issue with someone in the family then go to them directly. You don’t need to announce your issue in front of the whole family. Some people do this to force family members to choose sides in a situation .</p><p>When sides are taken, there is a divide in the family. Instead, go to that person privately with whom you have a problem. Discuss the issues, but do so with the the goal of reconciliation. Doing so with hardness in your heart or wanting to attribute blame won’t solve the problem.</p><p>3. Lack of Inclusion</p><p>An Ask Amy article was posted online that clearly puts family inclusion into perspective. Here is that wonderfully articulated response from Amy Dickinson of the Chicago Tribute:</p><p>4. Deception and Lies</p><p>Deception in a family is destructive. The truth always prevails. Sometimes it may take years or even a generation for the lies and deceit to become known, but know that they will come to light someday. If you can’t be honest with your family, who can you be honest with?</p><p>Lying to family or using deception to keep secrets leads to brokenness in a family. This brokenness comes from trust being corroded. The bigger the lie, the bigger the corrosion. Some lies, such as secret children born from an affair, can create insurmountable corrosion that will leave a family damaged for generations.</p><p>5. Failure to Accept Differences</p><p>Children who grow up in the same home with the same parents, same discipline, and same guidance do not turn out to be the same exact adults as their siblings. We all have differences. Allow others to be different. Just because you are family doesn’t mean you have to share the same political views or even the same religion. </p><p><strong>Explanations</strong></p><br />

                            11.   Why should life be fair to you? The fact that you are reading this, means you have food to eat, access to shelter, clothing, access to a computer and internet which approximately means you have some edge over some people around the world that has one thought — food.A lot of people complain about how life is unfair and how things went bad in their life. But hey, life was meant to be so, you just have to embrace it and not take it as the cake you can always have.You don’t expect life to be fair to you because you are a good person or you work so hard. Life has its own rules, it’s complicated and not the same for everyone.  If you tried once and failed then definitely you will discover that life is unfair. Life was not intended for those who try only once then give up but instead, it’s orchestrated for the determined and strong-minded people who keep trying until they get what they want.  Because life isn’t fair doesn’t mean you should give up and keep asking why. Life is a never-ending race of learning. When bad things happen to you (or when something good doesn’t happen to you every time), it may not just be something bad happening to you. It might be a chance to learn something new — about yourself, about the way the world works, the people around you which would propel you to a new level.​</h2><br />

                            30. Life feels like a massive rehearsal for every person you have to talk to, for every situation you have to attend,which just falls apart into wild swings of arrogance and timidity.Growing up didn't help with the awkwardness. There were just so many opportunities lost because I justcould not get what was before me - how I should react to it or deal with it.But growing up helped with coping. Even when an interaction is just a pile of your actions shattering into"Huh?" or "What?" or that other person's stare of bewilderment with matching eyebrows raised the best wayto deal with it is to not dwell on it too much.You are doing fine even when you are all over the place, because the mistakes you earn and the memories ofembarrassments past help in some way to try again and get it right with the right person.[...] And what growing up taught me most is that people come and go; what matters is the memories you hadwith them when they stayed You are the constant in this coming and going, so what will always matter is thatyou become a better person than yourself, and that you find mearing in all this clumsy struggling. You justhave to build value, either through becoming more well-adjusted or just becoming more skilled or justkeeping yourself going through the day.Excerpt from The Awkward Years by Ace Alba+1. in which paragraph expresses the main idea that encounter and engagement with people seems like a trialand error experience?A. paragraph 1B. paragraph 2C. paragraph 4D. paragraph 52.Which statement best summarizes the passage?A Entering adulthood is a time when people charge mistake as learning and deal with all sorts of uneasinessin one's lifeB.
