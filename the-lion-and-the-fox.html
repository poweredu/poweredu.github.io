He slunk about, however, as near as he was able without being seen, and one day overheard the Wolf talking to the Lion about him. The Wolf and the Fox were never good friends, and the Wolf was now calling the Lion’s attention to the fact that the Fox had not shown his face for a long time at Court, and added that he had strong reasons for suspecting that he was busily engaged in hatching some treason or other. The Lion thereupon commanded that the Fox should be brought at once to his presence, and the Jackal was accordingly sent to look for him. The Fox, being asked what he had to say for himself, replied that his absence, so far from arising from any want of respect for his sovereign, was the result of his extreme concern for his welfare. He had gone far and wide, he said, and consulted the most skilful physicians as to what was the best thing to be done to cure the King’s most grievous malady. “They say,” stated he (and here he gave a malicious leer at the Wolf), “that the only things to save your majesty’s life is to wrap yourself in the warm skin torn from a newly-killed Wolf.” The Lion, eager to try the experiment, at once dragged the Wolf towards him, and killed him on the spot.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Actually there's more but I'm tired of it typing, my fingers are like burning..</p><br />
