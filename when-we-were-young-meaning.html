If given a chance I would go back to me childhood years I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on ou faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being a child also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best so much glee and serenity Questions 1. What is the sentence that shows how the author feel about the topic? 2.

                                            "April 15th, 1802" by Dorothy Wordsworth Thursday, 15th It was a threatening, misty morning, but mild We set off after dinner from Eusemere Mra. Clarkson went a short way with us but tumed back The wind was furious, and we thought we mort have returned We first rested in the large boathouse, then under a furze bush opposite Mr Clarkson saw the plough goingin the field The wind seized our breath The lake was rough There was a beat by itself floating in the middle of the bay below Water Millock We rested again in the Water Millock Lane The hawthorns are black and green, the birches here and there greenish, but there is yet more of purple to be seen on the twigs We got overinto a field to avoid some cowe people working. A few primroses by the roadside-wood sorrel flower, the anemone, scentless violets, strawberries, and that starty yellow flower which Mrs C. calls pile worth When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park we saw a few daffodils close to the waterside. We fancied that the sea had floated the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went along there were more and yet more, and at last, under the boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a longbelt of them along the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpik road. I neversaw daffodils so beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones about and above them; some rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow, for weariness, and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake; they looked so gay, ever glancing, ever changing This wind blew directly over the lake to them There was here and there a little knot, and a few stragglers higher up, but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity, unity, and life of that one busy highway We rested again and again. The bays were stormy, and we heard the wavesat different distances, and in the middle of the water, like the sea.. All was cheerless and gloomy, so we faced the storm. At Dobson's I was very kindly treated by a young woman. The landlady looked sour, but it her way... William was sitting by a good fire when I came downstairs. He soon made his way to the libre piled up in a corner of the window. He brought out a volume of Enfield's Speaker, another miscellany and an odd volume of Congreve's plays We had a glass of warm rum and water. We enjoyed ourselves and wished for Mary.

 Last year, the Girl Scouts in our district celebrated their anniversary with a j̲o̲u̲r̲n̲e̲y̲. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of journey?) The purpose of this trip was to explore the virgin 
 forests of Palawan, since the forests of Palawan have not yet been touched by loggers. Many of 
 the Girl Scouts who went were i̲n̲d̲e̲p̲e̲n̲d̲e̲n̲t̲ girls. (What do you think is the meaning of 
 independent?) and did not need help in doing basic or e̲s̲s̲e̲n̲t̲i̲a̲l̲ things like cooking and hiking. 
 (What do you think is the meaning of essential?)
 Learning the meaning of c̲o̲o̲p̲e̲r̲a̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ helped to make their trip a success. (Guess the
 meaning of cooperation.) By working together well, most of them learned much and enjoy the 
 trip. They learned the value of p̲r̲e̲s̲e̲r̲v̲i̲n̲g̲ or taking good care of our forests to avoid floods and 
 soil erosion. (What is the meaning of preserving?)

The Secret Garden
 When Mary Lennox was sent to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the most d̲i̲s̲a̲g̲r̲e̲e̲a̲b̲l̲e̲-̲l̲o̲o̲k̲i̲n̲g̲ child ever seen. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour e̲x̲p̲r̲e̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India. She had always been i̲l̲l̲ in one way or another.
 Her father had held a p̲o̲s̲i̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ under the English government. He had always been busy and ill himself. Her mother had been a great beauty to cared only to go to parties and a̲m̲u̲s̲e̲ herself. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born, she ̲h̲a̲n̲d̲e̲d̲ her over to the care of an A̲y̲a̲h̲.
 She never remembered seeing f̲a̲m̲i̲l̲i̲a̲r̲l̲y̲ anything but the faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as t̲y̲r̲a̲n̲n̲i̲c̲a̲l̲ and selfish a little girl as ever lived.
 The young English g̲o̲v̲e̲r̲n̲e̲s̲s̲ who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When another governess came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So, if Mary had not chosen to learn how to read books, she would never have learned her letters at all.

(2 points each)Our Loyal FriendsWe havo often heard the adage A dog is a man's best friend' This has proven to be true time andagain, dogs have not only served as faithful pets, but also as workers and protectors. For example,in the Icy regions of Alaska, Huskies are often used to pull sleds, while the Doberman Pinschers areknown for being vigilant watchdogs.Dogs make endearing pets. Once they come to accept their human owners, dogs often remainstubbomly faithful to them even in the face of danger. This can be seen from the accounts offearless dogs which saved their owners from burning houses or protected them against intruders,Indeed, once they pledge their loyally, it can be readily assumed that these amazing animals willremain faithful for lifeMany dog owners believe that their pets are sensitive to their feelings and are able to respond tothem The truth of this, however, remains uncertain The wild ancestors of dogs hunted in packs, sotheir responses were guided by those of the pack leader Perhaps, in the case of domesticated dogs,the role of the pack leader falls on the dog owner Thus, a dog which seems upset when its master isupsel may simply be following its pack instinct. However, many dog owners testify to the fact thattheir dogs can sense their emotions even when they do not display themMost domestic dogs are expected to be able to understand and obey simple commands so that thedog owner can maintain some control over them. Dogs are best trained when they are young, anolder dog might be too set in its ways to change Dog Training sessions are best carried out when theanimal is hungry, in this way, it can be rewarded with food Basic commands such as 'siť, 'stay'.'come' and 'quiet' are the easiest to teach Some dog owners try to teach their dogs tricks such asrolling over and fetching newspapers. These tricks are best taught when the dogs are older, aboutsix months old. Persistent training sessions are necessary if a dog is to learn commands, and in time,a dog might even come to recognize its owner's emotions through the mere tone of his voiceSpeaking in a high pitch relays positive feelings, while a low pitch warns the dog that its master isdispleased.1 Give an example of dogs being used as protectors2. From the second paragraph, find a word that means 'descriplions'.3. hat could be an explanation of dogs being sensitive to their owner's feelings?4. Why is it said that dogs are best trained when they are young?5 What sophisticated skill could be learnt by a dog with enough time and practice?​</a>

Sarita How would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years. I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being a child also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best; so much glee and serenity 1.

"My friend" answered the professor, "we should never amuse ourselves at the expense of the poor. But you are rich, and may give yourself a much greater pleasure by means of the poor man. Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some unknown hand, would save from perishing.

                                            DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

                            5. "April 15th, 1802" by Dorothy Wordsworth Thursday, 15th It was a threatening, misty morning, but mild We set off after dinner from Eusemere Mra. Clarkson went a short way with us but tumed back The wind was furious, and we thought we mort have returned We first rested in the large boathouse, then under a furze bush opposite Mr Clarkson saw the plough goingin the field The wind seized our breath The lake was rough There was a beat by itself floating in the middle of the bay below Water Millock We rested again in the Water Millock Lane The hawthorns are black and green, the birches here and there greenish, but there is yet more of purple to be seen on the twigs We got overinto a field to avoid some cowe people working. A few primroses by the roadside-wood sorrel flower, the anemone, scentless violets, strawberries, and that starty yellow flower which Mrs C. calls pile worth When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park we saw a few daffodils close to the waterside. We fancied that the sea had floated the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went along there were more and yet more, and at last, under the boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a longbelt of them along the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpik road. I neversaw daffodils so beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones about and above them; some rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow, for weariness, and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake; they looked so gay, ever glancing, ever changing This wind blew directly over the lake to them There was here and there a little knot, and a few stragglers higher up, but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity, unity, and life of that one busy highway We rested again and again. The bays were stormy, and we heard the wavesat different distances, and in the middle of the water, like the sea.. All was cheerless and gloomy, so we faced the storm. At Dobson's I was very kindly treated by a young woman. The landlady looked sour, but it her way... William was sitting by a good fire when I came downstairs. He soon made his way to the libre piled up in a corner of the window. He brought out a volume of Enfield's Speaker, another miscellany and an odd volume of Congreve's plays We had a glass of warm rum and water. We enjoyed ourselves and wished for Mary.

 (What do you think is the meaning of journey?) The purpose of this trip was to explore the virgin 
 forests of Palawan, since the forests of Palawan have not yet been touched by loggers. Many of 
 the Girl Scouts who went were i̲n̲d̲e̲p̲e̲n̲d̲e̲n̲t̲ girls. (What do you think is the meaning of

 Learning the meaning of c̲o̲o̲p̲e̲r̲a̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ helped to make their trip a success. (Guess the
 meaning of cooperation.) By working together well, most of them learned much and enjoy the

 When Mary Lennox was sent to live with her uncle, everybody said she was the most d̲i̲s̲a̲g̲r̲e̲e̲a̲b̲l̲e̲-̲l̲o̲o̲k̲i̲n̲g̲ child ever seen. She had a little thin face and a little thin body, thin light hair and a sour e̲x̲p̲r̲e̲s̲s̲i̲o̲n̲. Her hair was yellow, and her face was yellow because she had been born in India. She had always been i̲l̲l̲ in one way or another.
 Her father had held a p̲o̲s̲i̲t̲i̲o̲n̲ under the English government. He had always been busy and ill himself. Her mother had been a great beauty to cared only to go to parties and a̲m̲u̲s̲e̲ herself. She had not wanted a little girl at all, and when Mary was born, she ̲h̲a̲n̲d̲e̲d̲ her over to the care of an A̲y̲a̲h̲.
 She never remembered seeing f̲a̲m̲i̲l̲i̲a̲r̲l̲y̲ anything but the faces of her Ayah and the other native servants. They always obeyed her and gave her own way in everything. By the time she was six years old she was as t̲y̲r̲a̲n̲n̲i̲c̲a̲l̲ and selfish a little girl as ever lived.
 The young English g̲o̲v̲e̲r̲n̲e̲s̲s̲ who came to teach her to read and write disliked her so much that she gave up her place in three months. When another governess came, they always went away in a shorter time than the first one. So, if Mary had not chosen to learn how to read books, she would never have learned her letters at all.

(2 points each)Our Loyal FriendsWe havo often heard the adage A dog is a man's best friend' This has proven to be true time andagain, dogs have not only served as faithful pets, but also as workers and protectors. For example,in the Icy regions of Alaska, Huskies are often used to pull sleds, while the Doberman Pinschers areknown for being vigilant watchdogs.Dogs make endearing pets. Once they come to accept their human owners, dogs often remainstubbomly faithful to them even in the face of danger. This can be seen from the accounts offearless dogs which saved their owners from burning houses or protected them against intruders,Indeed, once they pledge their loyally, it can be readily assumed that these amazing animals willremain faithful for lifeMany dog owners believe that their pets are sensitive to their feelings and are able to respond tothem The truth of this, however, remains uncertain The wild ancestors of dogs hunted in packs, sotheir responses were guided by those of the pack leader Perhaps, in the case of domesticated dogs,the role of the pack leader falls on the dog owner Thus, a dog which seems upset when its master isupsel may simply be following its pack instinct. However, many dog owners testify to the fact thattheir dogs can sense their emotions even when they do not display themMost domestic dogs are expected to be able to understand and obey simple commands so that thedog owner can maintain some control over them. Dogs are best trained when they are young, anolder dog might be too set in its ways to change Dog Training sessions are best carried out when theanimal is hungry, in this way, it can be rewarded with food Basic commands such as 'siť, 'stay'.'come' and 'quiet' are the easiest to teach Some dog owners try to teach their dogs tricks such asrolling over and fetching newspapers. These tricks are best taught when the dogs are older, aboutsix months old. Persistent training sessions are necessary if a dog is to learn commands, and in time,a dog might even come to recognize its owner's emotions through the mere tone of his voiceSpeaking in a high pitch relays positive feelings, while a low pitch warns the dog that its master isdispleased.1 Give an example of dogs being used as protectors2.

Sarita How would you feel if you're a young child again? No pile of homework, problem, and heartache. Everything just seems bright and perfect. If given a chance, I would go back to my childhood years. I believe childhood is the best period of life. It is the era of innocence. It is more on happiness instead of sorrow. Do you still remember when there was always a smile on our faces as the wind brushed through our hair? Or the different kinds of pain when we fell on our bicycles? The sweet agony, indeed. At least we learned to continue moving forward. Likewise, the feeling of victory when we finally reached the largest fruit after several attempts of climbing the mango tree. Those were the days when simplicity brings so much contentment. I am certain that childhood is the greatest stage of our life because we used to run and play like there's no tomorrow. Countless street games surely marked our hearts, not just our knees and elbows. The warmth of the sun could not stop us from beating our opponents, especially if it was a heated match. But our excitement grew more when raindrops started to wet the grass. It meant something else; an unexplainable feeling. We just enjoyed every moment of our life. Being a child also means forgiving and forgetting. We might have fights but we tend to forgive and forget easily. Without a doubt, childhood will always be the best; so much glee and serenity 1.

As they went along, they saw lying in the path a pair of old shoes, which they supposed to belong to a poor man who was employed in a field close by, and who had nearly finished his day's work. The student turned to the professor, saying: "Let us play the man a trick: we will hide his shoes, and conceal ourselves behind those bushes, and wait to see his perplexity when he cannot find them."

Put a coin into each shoe, and then we will hide ourselves and watch how the discovery affects him." The student did so, and they both placed themselves behind the bushes close by. The poor man soon finished his work, and came across the field to the path where he had left his coat and shoes. While putting on his coat he slipped his foot into one of his shoes; but feeling something hard, he stooped down to feel what it was, and found the coin. Astonishment and wonder were seen upon his countenance. He gazed upon the coin, turned it round, and looked at it again and again. He then looked around him on all sides, but no person was to be seen. He now put the money into his pocket, and proceeded to put on the other shoe; but his surprise was doubled on finding the other coin. His feelings overcame him; he fell upon his knees, looked up to heaven and uttered aloud a fervent thanksgiving, in which he spoke of his wife, sick and helpless, and his children without bread, whom the timely bounty, from some unknown hand, would save from perishing. The student stood there deeply affected, and his eyes filled with tears. "Now," said the professor, "are you not much better pleased than if you had played your intended trick?"

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. After reading the story, I have come to the conclusion that it is about the <strong>joy of giving</strong>. The young boy first wanted to play a mean trick on the poor farmer, but the teacher stopped him. Instead, the teacher asked him to do something nice for the stranger and watch what was going to happen.</p><p>2. The story has <strong>moved </strong>me. I understand how the boy felt. It has made me feel <strong>more willing to do kind things </strong>for other people. Likewise, I can better appreciate all the acts of kindness that I have experienced in my life.  </p><p>3. If I were in the shoes of the farmer, I would also <strong>feel shocked and grateful</strong>. Life has clearly not been good to the poor man, who had to work under the heat of the sun to support his loved ones. When you are feeling down, a little help can go a long way. It is also moving to know that there are <strong>people who care about me </strong>even if we do not know each other.</p><p>4. The author is trying to say that when you are in the position to help other people, you should not hesitate to do so. <strong>This is not only for the person but also for your own sake</strong>. By helping other people, you will get more joy from knowing that you have done some good in the world.</p><p>5. The short story wanted to show that <strong>we should help people who are less fortunate </strong>than we are. An act of kindness will always be better than a mean joke. It is good to spread love and kindness whenever you can. The two coins might have been nothing to the rich boy, but it made such a big difference to the poor man.</p><p><strong>Reflection:</strong></p><p>I agree with the author. There is no joy in making fun of people who are already feeling down. It might be funny to you, but it will make things so much more difficult for them. Instead, we should all focus our attention and energy into helping others. <strong>Every act of kindness goes a long way</strong>. In both small and big ways, there are always things we can do to make life at least a bit better and easier for others. The joy we get from these actions is always going to be more satisfying than the laughs we get from mean pranks.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This is the definition of a short story: https://brainly.ph/question/10282148</p><br />

                            14. DO ANTI-SMOKING AD CAMPAIGNS REALLY HELP? Yes, we have all seen those scary ads that warn people about horrible consequences smoking can bring. However, according to the official sources, more than fifteen of every 100 people in the United States aged 18 and older smoke today. They, too, see those ads. But they simply do not stop them from this dreadful habit. Or do they? Many politicians and public activists state that anti-smoking ads are ef- fective. And I believe so too. And here is why. First of all, according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers dropped significantly in the recent years. "Current smoking has declined from 20.9% (nearly 21 of every 100 adults) in 2005 to 15.5% (more than 15 of every 100 adults) in 2016," they report. And these figures are vivid enough for us to believe that antismoking campaigns really work. Active work in this area has helped many people quit this habit and go back to life with no smoking-related diseases. A lot of smokers oppose such claims and state that ad campaigns against smoking are inefficient. All they do, in their opinion, is scare both smokers and non-smokers and persuade only a small percentage of peo- ple with this habit to quit. Is it really worth all the money and time invest- ed in them? I believe so. If even a small number of people can be cured of this habit by trivial ads showing the real consequences of this choice), then it is worth every penny. Another reason why I believe that antismoking ads are effective is that a lot of people did not start smoking despite the peer pressure, stress (which allegedly is relieved by smoking) or any other aspects. When we look at the numbers dropping, we only think of people that quit, and we often forget to take into account those who never started smok- ing. Seeing ads showing the reality of smoking with the all the negative effect it can have on the body of the one smoking is a powerful tool that can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff. Week 10: Page 14 of 20 Finally, parents that see such ads get to quit to realizing how dangerous pas- sive smoking is for their kids. And this is a real victory, I believe. Growing up in families with smokers not only gives you the idea that smoking is totally normal but also exposes you to the hazardous effects of smoking at a very young age. To save younger generations from that, antismoking activists create a special sort of campaigns to target this layer of society. And it does work given the dropping numbers of smokers out there. As you see such ads indeed are effective. And even though there still are people who oppose the ideas described in them willing to keep their danger- ous habit, I hope that the meaning and hazards of smoking will one day be- come more obvious to them too. https://chiefessays.net/position-essay-examples-to-help-you-grasp-the-idea/ Guide Questions: 1.

The writer's evidences/reasons are that according to the Center of Disease Control and Prevention, the number of smokers has dropped significantly in recent years, their ads can motivate a lot of people to think twice before taking their first puff, and they can help parents realize how dangerous passive smoking is for their kids. </p><p>3. If I were the writer, my stand would be that anti-smoking ad campaigns are effective because they are able to motivate people to quit smoking and help parents realize the dangers of passive smoking for their kids. The evidence provided by the Center of Disease Control and Prevention also suggests that the number of smokers has declined significantly in the past decade, suggesting that the campaigns are having a positive impact.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            16. I NEED HELP AGAIN PLSSSSMUDDY ROADA Zen Story Tanzan and Ekido were once traveling together down a muddy road. A heavy rain was still falling. Coming around a bend, they met a lovely girl in a silk kimono and sash, unable to cross the intersection. “Come on girl," said Tanzan at once. Lifting her in his arms , he carried her over the mud. Ekido did not speak again until that night when they reached a lodging temple. Then he no longer could restrain himself, "We monks don't go near females," he told Tanzan, “especially not young and lovely ones. It is dangerous. Why did you do that?" "I left the girl there," said Tanzan. "Are you still carryingher?”1. What is the message of the parable?2. What did Tanzan mean when he said to Ekido, “Are you still carrying her?”3. Why do you think Tanzan is bothered after helping a lovely girl?4. Do you think it is good to disobey one's rule just to help someone? Explain.5. Helping is a good manner, but what is stopping the monk to do this?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The message of the parable differs from how a person interpret the story, since this was a discussion in our class, for me this meant "It is alright to break a rule to help people if the intent in is pure". </p><p>2. The meaning of "Are you still carrying her?" is Ekido is still thinking about the girl, like the 'girl' got stuck in Ekido's mind and therefore a "load that Ekido is carrying". </p><p>3. Since Tanzan's intention of helping the girl is pure, he isn't bothered by it nor does he feel convicted even after knowing he broke the rule. </p><p>4. In terms of religion rules, breaking a rule means you have sinned against the said religion and the God you serve, but the rule isn't and shouldn't be taken literally at all times, why do monks go near females for? For the reason that they might be tempted or that their resolve to be monk will waver. </p><p>5. Because the monk is not allowed to go near females especially the young and the lovely ones. And the monk might think that there will be punishment if they did that.</p><br />
