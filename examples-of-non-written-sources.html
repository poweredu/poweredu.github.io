This classification includes original works like poems, diaries, court records, interviews, surveys, and original research and research published in scholarly and/or academic journals. Secondary Sources Sources of information are classified as secondary sources when they describe, interpret, or analyze primary sources. These are often information written or presented by authors who did not personally witness an event or occurrence. Common examples of secondary sources include materials like textbooks, magazine articles, book reviews, commentaries, and almanacs. Tertiary Sources Sources of information are considered tertiary sources when they are used to organize and locate primary and secondary sources. This classification includes indexes, abstracts, bibliographies, directories, and databases. It is also important to understand that definitions of each source type may vary from one context to another. Likewise, it is essential to take note of certain guideposts when using information gathered for activities like researching a topic, among others. Remember that information should always be accurate, reliable, up-to-date, consistent, relevant, and unique.

                                            Directions: Categorize the following words in their respective type of sources. Synthesis is a written discussion taken from different sources. Simply, you take information from different references relevant to your topic and then create an overall point. It is important that you analyze the interrelationship among sources to come up with a good synthesis. In creating synthesis, you must analyze the relationship or connection of these sources and the ideas must be assessed and put in an orderly manner. Primary sources are first-hand or direct accounts from people. Also, these reflect the individual viewpoint and can be either verbal or non-verbal. In literature, those who have written a novel or poem are considered primary resources. The books or article about the novel or poem are labeled as secondary resources. In history, during the Edsa Revolution in 1986, those who have witnessed this event may write or share their experiences through a diary, interview, photographs, speeches, audio recordings, or poem (primary sources). On occasion, those who will study the same topic can analyze or interpret these primary sources and produce another work which will be noted as secondary source. Secondary sources are documents written based from the primary sources. Additionally, synthesis and summary are not the same. In synthesis, you will combine different ideas from relevant sources to come up with a concrete point. On the contrary, summary is plainly an organized written presentation from a single text. The process of synthesizing is normal since you often infer relationship between the movies you have watched with the books that you have read. Also, you may look for the similarities and differences in doing synthesis. Examples are provided below. Articles Diaries Encyclopedia Interview Observation Personal Experience Reviews Textbooks</a>

                            21. Learning Task 4: Find information about the characteristics and main symptoms of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19). If you have access to the Internet, you may use online or electronic sources of information. If connecting to the Internet is not possible, use non-electronic and print-based sources like newspapers, pamphlets, and/or posters. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. Use the table provided. This classification includes original works like poems, diaries, court records, interviews, surveys, and original research and research published in scholarly and/or academic journals. Secondary Sources Sources of information are classified as secondary sources when they describe, interpret, or analyze primary sources. These are often information written or presented by authors who did not personally witness an event or occurrence. Common examples of secondary sources include materials like textbooks, magazine articles, book reviews, commentaries, and almanacs. Tertiary Sources Sources of information are considered tertiary sources when they are used to organize and locate primary and secondary sources. This classification includes indexes, abstracts, bibliographies, directories, and databases. It is also important to understand that definitions of each source type may vary from one context to another. Likewise, it is essential to take note of certain guideposts when using information gathered for activities like researching a topic, among others. Remember that information should always be accurate, reliable, up-to-date, consistent, relevant, and unique.

                            26. Directions: Categorize the following words in their respective type of sources. Synthesis is a written discussion taken from different sources. Simply, you take information from different references relevant to your topic and then create an overall point. It is important that you analyze the interrelationship among sources to come up with a good synthesis. In creating synthesis, you must analyze the relationship or connection of these sources and the ideas must be assessed and put in an orderly manner. Primary sources are first-hand or direct accounts from people. Also, these reflect the individual viewpoint and can be either verbal or non-verbal. In literature, those who have written a novel or poem are considered primary resources. The books or article about the novel or poem are labeled as secondary resources. In history, during the Edsa Revolution in 1986, those who have witnessed this event may write or share their experiences through a diary, interview, photographs, speeches, audio recordings, or poem (primary sources). On occasion, those who will study the same topic can analyze or interpret these primary sources and produce another work which will be noted as secondary source. Secondary sources are documents written based from the primary sources. Additionally, synthesis and summary are not the same. In synthesis, you will combine different ideas from relevant sources to come up with a concrete point. On the contrary, summary is plainly an organized written presentation from a single text. The process of synthesizing is normal since you often infer relationship between the movies you have watched with the books that you have read. Also, you may look for the similarities and differences in doing synthesis. Examples are provided below. Articles Diaries Encyclopedia Interview Observation Personal Experience Reviews Textbooks</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are two types of syntheses: explanatory syntheses and argumentative syntheses. Explanatory syntheses seek to bring sources together to explain a perspective and the reasoning behind it. Argumentative syntheses seek to bring sources together to make an argument. Both types of synthesis involve looking for relationships between sources and drawing conclusions.</p><p>In order to successfully synthesize your sources, you might begin by grouping your sources by topic and looking for connections. For example, if you were researching the pros and cons of encouraging healthy eating in children, you would want to separate your sources to find which ones agree with each other and which ones disagree.</p><p>After you have a good idea of what your sources are saying, you want to construct your body paragraphs in a way that acknowledges different sources and highlights where you can draw new conclusions.</p><p></p><br />
