Objectives:•	Identify whether the changes in the materials is useful or harmful in the environment; •	Describe the beneficial and harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment; and •	Suggest ways of preventing/minimizing the harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment. II. Effects of Changes in Materials to the EnvironmentIII. Learning Tasks: A. Engagement:1. Drill: A. Identify if the given mixture is heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture._____1. staple wire and paper clip_____2. Flour and baby powder_____3. White sugar and iodized salt_____4. Marbles and pebbles_____5. Powder milk and corn starch2. Review: What is mixture?What is heterogeneous mixture?What is homogeneous mixture?B. Motivation:	In the last module, you learned about the different changes in some properties of materials. Can you recall the properties such as size, shape, texture, color and odor of materials as they undergo change? In the next lessons, you will describe, understand, and evaluate whether these changes in materials are useful or harmful in the environment.C. Exploration: (Please  remind the your child to be careful in handling materials. Tell them to do the activities in handling materials needs the presence of an adult.)Activity 1. A Work of Art 	Changes happen in materials. How do these materials change? What effects do these materials have to do with our environment? What you need: piece of paper popsicle sticks glue What to do: 1. Construct a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper. 2. Glue the popsicle sticks together to make picture frame. Answer the following questions: 1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the popsicle sticks?2. What kind of effect does make paper boat or airplane do in the environment? Activity 2Precaution: Do not play with the match. Be careful in doing the activity. Do the activity in the presence of adult. Do not touch the plastic when it is still hot.What you need:piece of paperpieces of plasticmatchWhat to do:1. Put the pieces of paper and pieces of plastic bottle in an aluminum container.2. Burn the paper and plastic in the aluminum container.Answer the following questions:1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the pieces of plastic?2. What kind of effect does burning paper and plastic do to the environment?D. Discussion:	Many changes are happening around us. Materials are characterized by changes in size, shape, color, physical appearance or phase. Some of these changes can be good (useful) or bad (harmful) to the environment. Making a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper and gluing popsicle sticks together to make a picture frame are some examples of useful changes in materials. 	When you burn paper and plastic, the original characteristics of both materials changes. When paper and plastic is burned, heat, light, carbon dioxide, water and ashes are produced. These byproducts like carbon dioxide and ashes results to air pollution which is harmful to our environment. 	Some changes in materials have bad effects to the environment. Improper disposal of garbage, dumping of harmful chemicals and human waste can cause land, air and water to be polluted. Smoke from burning wood, paper and oil can cause air pollution. Land pollution occur when we throw garbage and use harmful pesticides on their farms. Water becomes polluted when oil from ships and garbage are thrown in it. 	A clean environment is a good place to live. A pile of garbage can be avoided if we know how to reduce, recycle and reuse materials. Instead of throwing all these materials we can change their appearance and put them into good use. 	To reduce means to lower the amount of waste you produce. Instead of buying a mineral water in the store, you can lessen the need for plastic bottle by bringing your own glass or cup. Reusing means to make the most of the item before you get rid of it. When you have plastic bags at home, use them again and again in going to the market. Recycling is the breaking down of an item so the materials can be made into a new item. Paper items like old newspaper and magazines can be sold to paper mills which turns then into usable paper again. 	Some changes in materials can be harmful. These changes can create air, land, water pollution. There are many ways each of us can help. To keep our environment safe and clean people are encouraged to reduce, recycle, reuse, repair, conserve, segregate, conduct clean up drive and treeE. Elaboration: Activity 1: Impact of Change Write YES if the change will have a bad or harmful effect and NO if not. ______1. Cutting of trees ______2. Smoke from vehicles ______3. Using dangerous aerosol sprays ______4. Throwing of garbage in bodies of water ______5. Using toxic chemicals on land Activity 2: The Three R’s What to do: Decide whe​</a>

                                            Learning Task 1: The table below consists of shuffled parts of a movie review. Identify which part of movie review is presented by each paragraph. Choose your answers from the options provided inside the box. Write only the letter of your answer.A. TitleE. Character LimelightB. Film IntroF. Likes and DislikesC. Plot SummaryG. Lesson LearnedD. Setting SpotlightH. RecommendationsPARAGRAPHS1. The film was keen on details and it’s refreshing. This film deserves to be watched to inspire each and every one of us. If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema.I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.pa help naman​</a>

Objectives:•	Identify whether the changes in the materials is useful or harmful in the environment; •	Describe the beneficial and harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment; and •	Suggest ways of preventing/minimizing the harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment. II. Effects of Changes in Materials to the EnvironmentIII. Learning Tasks: A. Engagement:1. Drill: A. Identify if the given mixture is heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture._____1. staple wire and paper clip_____2. Flour and baby powder_____3. White sugar and iodized salt_____4. Marbles and pebbles_____5. Powder milk and corn starch2. Review: What is mixture?What is heterogeneous mixture?What is homogeneous mixture?B. Motivation:	In the last module, you learned about the different changes in some properties of materials. Can you recall the properties such as size, shape, texture, color and odor of materials as they undergo change? In the next lessons, you will describe, understand, and evaluate whether these changes in materials are useful or harmful in the environment.C. Exploration: (Please  remind the your child to be careful in handling materials. Tell them to do the activities in handling materials needs the presence of an adult.)Activity 1. A Work of Art 	Changes happen in materials. How do these materials change? What effects do these materials have to do with our environment? What you need: piece of paper popsicle sticks glue What to do: 1. Construct a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper. 2. Glue the popsicle sticks together to make picture frame. Answer the following questions: 1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the popsicle sticks?2. What kind of effect does make paper boat or airplane do in the environment? Activity 2Precaution: Do not play with the match. Be careful in doing the activity. Do the activity in the presence of adult. Do not touch the plastic when it is still hot.What you need:piece of paperpieces of plasticmatchWhat to do:1. Put the pieces of paper and pieces of plastic bottle in an aluminum container.2. Burn the paper and plastic in the aluminum container.Answer the following questions:1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the pieces of plastic?2. What kind of effect does burning paper and plastic do to the environment?D. Discussion:	Many changes are happening around us. Materials are characterized by changes in size, shape, color, physical appearance or phase. Some of these changes can be good (useful) or bad (harmful) to the environment. Making a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper and gluing popsicle sticks together to make a picture frame are some examples of useful changes in materials. 	When you burn paper and plastic, the original characteristics of both materials changes. When paper and plastic is burned, heat, light, carbon dioxide, water and ashes are produced. These byproducts like carbon dioxide and ashes results to air pollution which is harmful to our environment. 	Some changes in materials have bad effects to the environment. Improper disposal of garbage, dumping of harmful chemicals and human waste can cause land, air and water to be polluted. Smoke from burning wood, paper and oil can cause air pollution. Land pollution occur when we throw garbage and use harmful pesticides on their farms. Water becomes polluted when oil from ships and garbage are thrown in it. 	A clean environment is a good place to live. A pile of garbage can be avoided if we know how to reduce, recycle and reuse materials. Instead of throwing all these materials we can change their appearance and put them into good use. 	To reduce means to lower the amount of waste you produce. Instead of buying a mineral water in the store, you can lessen the need for plastic bottle by bringing your own glass or cup. Reusing means to make the most of the item before you get rid of it. When you have plastic bags at home, use them again and again in going to the market. Recycling is the breaking down of an item so the materials can be made into a new item. Paper items like old newspaper and magazines can be sold to paper mills which turns then into usable paper again. 	Some changes in materials can be harmful. These changes can create air, land, water pollution. There are many ways each of us can help. To keep our environment safe and clean people are encouraged to reduce, recycle, reuse, repair, conserve, segregate, conduct clean up drive and tree planting.E. Elaboration: Activity 1: Impact of Change Write YES if the change will have a bad or harmful effect and NO if not. ______1. Cutting of trees ______2. Smoke from vehicles ______3. Using dangerous aerosol sprays ______4. Throwing of garbage in bodies of water ______5. Using toxic chemicals on land ​</a>

                                            In 1970, the school board in Pittsfield, New Hampshire, approved a dress code that prohibited students from wearing certain types of clothing. The school board members believed that wearing “play clothes” to school made the students lax and indifferent toward their school work, while more formal attire established a positive educational climate. When twelve-year-old Kevin Bannister wore a pair of blue jeans to school, he was sent home for violating the dress code.
Kevin and his parents believed that his constitutional rights had been violated. The United States District Court of New Hampshire agreed to hear Kevin’s case. His claim was based on the notion of personal liberty—the right of every individual to the control of his or her own person—protected by the Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment. The court agreed with Kevin that a person’s right to wear clothing of his or her own choosing is, in fact, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court noted, however, that restrictions may be justified in some circumstances, such as in the school setting.
So did Kevin have a right to wear blue jeans to school? The court determined that the school board had failed to show that wearing jeans actually inhibited the educational process. Furthermore, the board offered no evidence to back up its claim that such clothing created a negative educational environment. Certainly the school board would be justified in prohibiting students from wearing clothing that was unsanitary, revealing, or obscene. The court remained unconvinced, therefore, that wearing jeans would actually impair the learning process of Kevin or of his fellow classmates.
Kevin Bannister’s case was significant in that it was the first in the United States to address clothing prohibitions of a school dress code. His challenge initiated a review of students’ rights and administrative responsibility in public education.
Suppose the writer’s goal had been to write a brief persuasive essay urging students to exercise their constitutional rights. Would this essay fulfill that goal?
Yes, because the essay focuses on how Kevin encouraged other students to exercise their constitutional rights.
Yes, because the essay focuses on various types of clothing historically worn by students as a freedom of expression.
No, because the essay suggests that the right to wear blue jeans was not a substantial constitutional right in the 1970s.
No, because the essay objectively reports on one case of a student exercising a particular constitutional right.</a>

                            8. .Science 4 – Week 6First QuarterOctober 21, 2021I. Objectives:•	Identify whether the changes in the materials is useful or harmful in the environment; •	Describe the beneficial and harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment; and •	Suggest ways of preventing/minimizing the harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment. II. Effects of Changes in Materials to the EnvironmentIII. Learning Tasks: A. Engagement:1. Drill: A. Identify if the given mixture is heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture._____1. staple wire and paper clip_____2. Flour and baby powder_____3. White sugar and iodized salt_____4. Marbles and pebbles_____5. Powder milk and corn starch2. Review: What is mixture?What is heterogeneous mixture?What is homogeneous mixture?B. Motivation:	In the last module, you learned about the different changes in some properties of materials. Can you recall the properties such as size, shape, texture, color and odor of materials as they undergo change? In the next lessons, you will describe, understand, and evaluate whether these changes in materials are useful or harmful in the environment.C. Exploration: (Please  remind the your child to be careful in handling materials. Tell them to do the activities in handling materials needs the presence of an adult.)Activity 1. A Work of Art 	Changes happen in materials. How do these materials change? What effects do these materials have to do with our environment? What you need: piece of paper popsicle sticks glue What to do: 1. Construct a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper. 2. Glue the popsicle sticks together to make picture frame. Answer the following questions: 1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the popsicle sticks?2. What kind of effect does make paper boat or airplane do in the environment? Activity 2Precaution: Do not play with the match. Be careful in doing the activity. Do the activity in the presence of adult. Do not touch the plastic when it is still hot.What you need:piece of paperpieces of plasticmatchWhat to do:1. Put the pieces of paper and pieces of plastic bottle in an aluminum container.2. Burn the paper and plastic in the aluminum container.Answer the following questions:1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the pieces of plastic?2. What kind of effect does burning paper and plastic do to the environment?D. Discussion:	Many changes are happening around us. Materials are characterized by changes in size, shape, color, physical appearance or phase. Some of these changes can be good (useful) or bad (harmful) to the environment. Making a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper and gluing popsicle sticks together to make a picture frame are some examples of useful changes in materials. 	When you burn paper and plastic, the original characteristics of both materials changes. When paper and plastic is burned, heat, light, carbon dioxide, water and ashes are produced. These byproducts like carbon dioxide and ashes results to air pollution which is harmful to our environment. 	Some changes in materials have bad effects to the environment. Improper disposal of garbage, dumping of harmful chemicals and human waste can cause land, air and water to be polluted. Smoke from burning wood, paper and oil can cause air pollution. Land pollution occur when we throw garbage and use harmful pesticides on their farms. Water becomes polluted when oil from ships and garbage are thrown in it. 	A clean environment is a good place to live. A pile of garbage can be avoided if we know how to reduce, recycle and reuse materials. Instead of throwing all these materials we can change their appearance and put them into good use. 	To reduce means to lower the amount of waste you produce. Instead of buying a mineral water in the store, you can lessen the need for plastic bottle by bringing your own glass or cup. Reusing means to make the most of the item before you get rid of it. When you have plastic bags at home, use them again and again in going to the market. Recycling is the breaking down of an item so the materials can be made into a new item. Paper items like old newspaper and magazines can be sold to paper mills which turns then into usable paper again. 	Some changes in materials can be harmful. These changes can create air, land, water pollution. There are many ways each of us can help. To keep our environment safe and clean people are encouraged to reduce, recycle, reuse, repair, conserve, segregate, conduct clean up drive and treeE. Elaboration: Activity 1: Impact of Change Write YES if the change will have a bad or harmful effect and NO if not. ______1. Cutting of trees ______2. Smoke from vehicles ______3. Using dangerous aerosol sprays ______4. Throwing of garbage in bodies of water ______5. Using toxic chemicals on land Activity 2: The Three R’s What to do: Decide whe​</h2><br />

If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2.Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3.“100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6.Catharsis in NostalgiaBy Abigail Eclavea7.It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema.I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.pa help naman​</h2><br />

                            13. .Science 4 – Week 6First QuarterOctober 21, 2021I. Objectives:•	Identify whether the changes in the materials is useful or harmful in the environment; •	Describe the beneficial and harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment; and •	Suggest ways of preventing/minimizing the harmful effects of the changes in the materials to the environment. II. Effects of Changes in Materials to the EnvironmentIII. Learning Tasks: A. Engagement:1. Drill: A. Identify if the given mixture is heterogeneous or homogeneous mixture._____1. staple wire and paper clip_____2. Flour and baby powder_____3. White sugar and iodized salt_____4. Marbles and pebbles_____5. Powder milk and corn starch2. Review: What is mixture?What is heterogeneous mixture?What is homogeneous mixture?B. Motivation:	In the last module, you learned about the different changes in some properties of materials. Can you recall the properties such as size, shape, texture, color and odor of materials as they undergo change? In the next lessons, you will describe, understand, and evaluate whether these changes in materials are useful or harmful in the environment.C. Exploration: (Please  remind the your child to be careful in handling materials. Tell them to do the activities in handling materials needs the presence of an adult.)Activity 1. A Work of Art 	Changes happen in materials. How do these materials change? What effects do these materials have to do with our environment? What you need: piece of paper popsicle sticks glue What to do: 1. Construct a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper. 2. Glue the popsicle sticks together to make picture frame. Answer the following questions: 1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the popsicle sticks?2. What kind of effect does make paper boat or airplane do in the environment? Activity 2Precaution: Do not play with the match. Be careful in doing the activity. Do the activity in the presence of adult. Do not touch the plastic when it is still hot.What you need:piece of paperpieces of plasticmatchWhat to do:1. Put the pieces of paper and pieces of plastic bottle in an aluminum container.2. Burn the paper and plastic in the aluminum container.Answer the following questions:1. What changes takes place in the piece of paper? What about the pieces of plastic?2. What kind of effect does burning paper and plastic do to the environment?D. Discussion:	Many changes are happening around us. Materials are characterized by changes in size, shape, color, physical appearance or phase. Some of these changes can be good (useful) or bad (harmful) to the environment. Making a paper boat or airplane using a piece of paper and gluing popsicle sticks together to make a picture frame are some examples of useful changes in materials. 	When you burn paper and plastic, the original characteristics of both materials changes. When paper and plastic is burned, heat, light, carbon dioxide, water and ashes are produced. These byproducts like carbon dioxide and ashes results to air pollution which is harmful to our environment. 	Some changes in materials have bad effects to the environment. Improper disposal of garbage, dumping of harmful chemicals and human waste can cause land, air and water to be polluted. Smoke from burning wood, paper and oil can cause air pollution. Land pollution occur when we throw garbage and use harmful pesticides on their farms. Water becomes polluted when oil from ships and garbage are thrown in it. 	A clean environment is a good place to live. A pile of garbage can be avoided if we know how to reduce, recycle and reuse materials. Instead of throwing all these materials we can change their appearance and put them into good use. 	To reduce means to lower the amount of waste you produce. Instead of buying a mineral water in the store, you can lessen the need for plastic bottle by bringing your own glass or cup. Reusing means to make the most of the item before you get rid of it. When you have plastic bags at home, use them again and again in going to the market. Recycling is the breaking down of an item so the materials can be made into a new item. Paper items like old newspaper and magazines can be sold to paper mills which turns then into usable paper again. 	Some changes in materials can be harmful. These changes can create air, land, water pollution. There are many ways each of us can help. To keep our environment safe and clean people are encouraged to reduce, recycle, reuse, repair, conserve, segregate, conduct clean up drive and tree planting.E. Elaboration: Activity 1: Impact of Change Write YES if the change will have a bad or harmful effect and NO if not. ______1. Cutting of trees ______2. Smoke from vehicles ______3. Using dangerous aerosol sprays ______4. Throwing of garbage in bodies of water ______5. Using toxic chemicals on land ​</h2><br />

First, JC Santos as Fidel showswriting poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed atbecause of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and thatsame inspiration is not enough to win a gid or to have a happy ending. Santos'sperformance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreakingconfrontation scene: 'Friendzoned' right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella,who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She's effortless even if she is playing afrustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in rollercoaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hafing her, but I realized she'san epitome of a character we need to embracel3."100 Tula Para kay Stella" is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about afreshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to expresshis love for the campus rock star, Stella, When in college, they become close friends.When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confesshis love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that tumed into "love", but it's not atypical love story that we've seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4.90's FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there's the element of nostalgia in the film, resonatingwith the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of thevintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98' Degreesand Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya's "Balisong", it displays the time when Pinoy RockBands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting atthe same time seeing the time of social media back then.5.Just with the title, I got the "I want to watch this!" feeling.

                            22. In 1970, the school board in Pittsfield, New Hampshire, approved a dress code that prohibited students from wearing certain types of clothing. The school board members believed that wearing “play clothes” to school made the students lax and indifferent toward their school work, while more formal attire established a positive educational climate. When twelve-year-old Kevin Bannister wore a pair of blue jeans to school, he was sent home for violating the dress code.
Kevin and his parents believed that his constitutional rights had been violated. The United States District Court of New Hampshire agreed to hear Kevin’s case. His claim was based on the notion of personal liberty—the right of every individual to the control of his or her own person—protected by the Constitution’s Fourteenth Amendment. The court agreed with Kevin that a person’s right to wear clothing of his or her own choosing is, in fact, protected by the Fourteenth Amendment. The court noted, however, that restrictions may be justified in some circumstances, such as in the school setting.
So did Kevin have a right to wear blue jeans to school? The court determined that the school board had failed to show that wearing jeans actually inhibited the educational process. Furthermore, the board offered no evidence to back up its claim that such clothing created a negative educational environment. Certainly the school board would be justified in prohibiting students from wearing clothing that was unsanitary, revealing, or obscene. The court remained unconvinced, therefore, that wearing jeans would actually impair the learning process of Kevin or of his fellow classmates.
Kevin Bannister’s case was significant in that it was the first in the United States to address clothing prohibitions of a school dress code. His challenge initiated a review of students’ rights and administrative responsibility in public education.
Suppose the writer’s goal had been to write a brief persuasive essay urging students to exercise their constitutional rights. Would this essay fulfill that goal?
Yes, because the essay focuses on how Kevin encouraged other students to exercise their constitutional rights.
Yes, because the essay focuses on various types of clothing historically worn by students as a freedom of expression.
No, because the essay suggests that the right to wear blue jeans was not a substantial constitutional right in the 1970s.
No, because the essay objectively reports on one case of a student exercising a particular constitutional right.</h2><br />

Choose your answers from the options provided inside the box. Write only the letter of your answer.A. Title E. Character LimelightB. Film Intro F. Likes and DislikesC. Plot Summary G. Lesson LearnedD. Setting Spotlight H. Recommendations1. The film was keen on details and it’s refreshing. This film deserves to be watched to inspire each and every one of us. If you allow it, the film can even move your heart. If you liked Kita Kita, then I assure you that you’ll dig 100 Tula Para Kay Stella as well and get the “I want to watch it again!” feeling.2. Loser to Ideal-typeThe film successfully delivered the characters’ journey. First, JC Santos as Fidel shows writing poems as an outlet for someone who wanted to avoid being laughed at because of his speech defect. He proves how inspiration can change life and that same inspiration is not enough to win a girl or to have a happy ending. Santos’s performance, when Stella hands down the poems to him, creates a heartbreaking confrontation scene. ‘Friendzoned’ right there. Then, there is Bela Padilla as Stella, who surprises us with her natural acting skill. She’s effortless even if she is playing a frustrated rock artist who is facing many challenges in life. I found myself in roller coaster as I watch her character, from loving her to hating her, but I realized, she’s an epitome of a character we need to embrace.3. “100 Tula Para kay Stella” is directed by Jason Paul Laxamana. It is a story about a freshman, Fidel, who stutters. He loves poetry which serves as his avenue to express his love for the campus rock star, Stella. When in college, they become close friends. When he reached his 100th poem, Fidel finally gave the poems to Stella to confess his love. Yes, it is about friendship beginnings that turned into ‘love’, but it’s not a typical love story that we’ve seen in Pinoy teen romance films.4. 90’s FeelsAside from the excellent casts, there’s the element of nostalgia in the film, resonating with the millennials. I know Gen X and even Y will be delighted to see the days of the vintage Nokia phone, diskettes and cassette tapes, and POP idols like 98’ Degrees and Mariah Carey. With Rivermaya’s “Balisong”, it displays the time when Pinoy Rock Bands were in boom. Even Friendster existed and it sounds bizarre and interesting at the same time seeing the time of social media back then.5. Just with the title, I got the “I want to watch this!” feeling. At first, when I heard it from my classmates, I thought it would be about ‘spoken poetry’ which has been in social media platforms nowadays, but I was totally wrong. Since Pista ng Pelikulang Pilipino (PPP) is over, let me share my insights about this movie.6. Catharsis in Nostalgia by Abigail Eclavea7. It is with the effect that Filipino film makers are thriving to offer something fresh and new to movie audiences. ‘100 Tula Para kay Stella’ gives the idea that mainstream and indie film are put together. It surprisingly includes some elements that are hardly present in mainstream cinema. “I love that there’s more to poetry and music in the movie. It features admirable characters and the 2000’s vibes.”​</h2><br />
