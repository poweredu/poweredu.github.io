Identify the effect in this text. Despite the country’s economic growth, there are still many Filipinos who are unemployed. One reason for unemployment is overpopulation. The rate at which jobs are created is simply not enough to cater to the country’s ballooning population. Another reason for unemployment is skill mismatch. Many fresh graduates took up college courses that were previously in great demand. As the supply exceeds the demand, many are unable to find work as their skills do not fit the ones that are in demand in the job market. a. Many Filipinos are college graduates.b. Many Filipinos are unemployedc. The Philippines has a large populationd. The Philippines has low quality jobs.15. What is the effect in the following paragraph? With over 11 million people, the National Capital Region (NCR) is the most populous region in the Philippines. There are several reasons for its large population. First, many businesses set up their offices and operations in the NCR. These businesses offer better jobs and potentially higher income to people in the rural areas. Second, there are many schools in the NCR that offer courses which are not available in schools in the province. Many students living in the provinces then decide to go to the region to get their education. Lastly, there are numerous places for leisure and entertainment in the cities in the NCR. People from the provinces are then encouraged to visit those places and to live there eventually. a. Migration is a major problem in NCRb. The NCR is the most densely populated region in the country.c. The NCR has the best schools in the countryd. People from rural areas have migrated to the NCR.​</a>

Narito na ang himpilan at sandiganng bayan, ito ang Radyo Balita, Agad. Host : Bagamat bahagya nang humina ang bagyong Rolly, tumama ito bilang isang "super typhoon" nitong madaling araw ng Linggo sa Bicol Region. Patunay ng bagsik ng bagyo ang malalakas na hangin na tila sumisipol at humahambalos, at pagkaanod ng malalaking bato, buhangin, at lahar. Sa lakas din ng hangin, bumagsak ang kisame ng isang silid ng paaralan kung saan may ilang inilikas na residente pero wala namang nasaktan. Libo-libong residente rin ang inilikas at nananatili ngayon sa mga evacuation center, at nawalan din ng kuryente sa maraming lugar sa rehiyon. Patuloy na nagsasagawa ngayon ng rapid damage assessment ang mga lokal na pamahalaan sa halaga ng pinsala sa agrikultura at impraestruktura na dulot ng bagyo.Isa sa libo-libong nasalanta ng bagyong Rolly ay ang pamilya ni Mang Carding.

Identify the effect in this text. Despite the country’s economic growth, there are still many Filipinos who are unemployed. One reason for unemployment is overpopulation. The rate at which jobs are created is simply not enough to cater to the country’s ballooning population. Another reason for unemployment is skill mismatch. Many fresh graduates took up college courses that were previously in great demand. As the supply exceeds the demand, many are unable to find work as their skills do not fit the ones that are in demand in the job market. a. Many Filipinos are college graduates.b. Many Filipinos are unemployedc. The Philippines has a large populationd. The Philippines has low quality jobs.15. What is the effect in the following paragraph? With over 11 million people, the National Capital Region (NCR) is the most populous region in the Philippines. There are several reasons for its large population. First, many businesses set up their offices and operations in the NCR. These businesses offer better jobs and potentially higher income to people in the rural areas. Second, there are many schools in the NCR that offer courses which are not available in schools in the province.
