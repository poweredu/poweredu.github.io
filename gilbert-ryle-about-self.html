                        <p>According to <strong>Gilbert Ryle</strong>, this is the definition of the self:</p><p>Gilbert Ryle argues against the theory that the mind does not exist and therefore cannot be the seat of the self. Ryle believes that <strong>self comes from behavior. We are just a collection of behaviors caused by the physical work of the body.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>EXPLANATION:</strong></p><p>In general, self-understanding is a person's perspective and attitude towards himself. Self-concept is closely related to physical dimensions, individual character, and self-motivation. A self-view includes an individual's strengths and weaknesses, including his or her failures. Self is the essence of personality in a person. The core of the individual's personality has a very important role in determining and directing the development of a person's personality and behavior in society.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, the self is a person's view or assessment of him/herself. An expert in the field of psychology also divides self-concept into three forms, including:</p>Body image, which is a person's awareness of seeing the body and himself.Ideal self, namely the hopes and ideals of a person about himself.Social self, which is how he thinks other people see him.<p></p><p>Self-assessment is very influential on various aspects of life, <strong>from social to work environment though.</strong> A person has a negative self-assessment when he sees himself as helpless, weak, unfortunate, failed, disliked, incompetent and so on. People who have a positive self-concept will more easily adapt to many situations. He views bad things as having wisdom and not as the end of everything. People like this are usually more confident, optimistic and always think something can be solved.</p><p></p><p>The characteristics of individuals who have a positive self-concept are:</p>Assuming others are the same as himselfHave confidence in being able to overcome various problemsCan receive compliments without feeling embarrassedHave an awareness that other people have feelings, desires, and behaviors that are not necessarily accepted by all members of societyDesire and ability to improve oneself<p><br />Learn more about self love, self knowledge, self confidence, self respect and self expression:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/8656566</p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><br />

                            6. what is the experience of Gilbert Ryle in his philosophy of mind?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ryle’s first book, The Concept of Mind (1949), is considered a modern classic. In it he challenges the traditional distinction between body and mind as delineated by René Descartes. Traditional Cartesian dualism, Ryle says, perpetrates a serious confusion when, looking beyond the human body (which exists in space and is subject to mechanical laws), it views the mind as an additional mysterious thing not subject to observation or to mechanical laws, rather than as the form or organizing principle of the body. What Ryle deems to be logically incoherent dogma of Cartesianism he labels as the doctrine of the ghost-in-the-machine.</p><p>Motives may be revealed or explained by a person's behavior in a situation. Ryle criticizes the theory that the mind is a place where mental images are apprehended, perceived, or remembered. Sensations, thoughts, and feelings do not belong to a mental world which is distinct from the physical world.</p><p></p><p>•For example</p><p>When you go to sleep, The question people always ask is "<strong>Where do i go?</strong>", Ryle Believes that our soul leaves the body and travels the entire universe, He also stated that's what happens when you sleep or take a nap "<strong>Y</strong><strong>ou</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Dream</strong>" and go to your personal world or universe.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>Socrates</strong> - The self is the center of reasoning and self-knowledge.</p><p></p><p>MY EXPLANATION/ DEFINITION ABOUT THE SELF: Socrates believed that knowing oneself is essential to living a fulfilling life. He argued that the self is the center of reasoning and that one must strive to understand oneself in order to gain wisdom and knowledge.</p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Plato</strong> - The self is an immortal soul that transcends the physical world.</p><p></p><p>MY EXPLANATION/ DEFINITION ABOUT THE SELF: According to Plato, the self is more than just the physical body. It is an immortal soul that exists beyond the physical world and is capable of experiencing eternal realities. He believed that the physical world was merely a shadow of the true reality that exists in the world of forms.</p><p></p><p>3. <strong>Aristotle</strong> - The self is a combination of the body and the mind.</p><p></p><p>MY EXPLANATION/ DEFINITION ABOUT THE SELF: Aristotle believed that the self is a combination of the body and the mind. He argued that humans possess a unique capacity for reasoning that sets us apart from other animals. The self, therefore, is the combination of rational thought and physical experience.</p><p></p><p>4. <strong>St. Augustine</strong> - The self is a reflection of God's image.</p><p></p><p>MY EXPLANATION/ DEFINITION ABOUT THE SELF: St. Augustine believed that the self was a reflection of God's image. He argued that humans have an innate desire to seek and find God within themselves, and that this search was the key to understanding the self.</p><p></p><p>5. <strong>Rene Descartes</strong> - The self is a thinking thing that exists independently of the physical world.</p><p></p><p>MY EXPLANATION/ DEFINITION ABOUT THE SELF: Descartes believed that the self was a thinking thing that existed independently of the physical world. He argued that our thoughts and consciousness were the only things we could truly know, and that everything else was uncertain or subject to doubt.</p><p></p><p>6. <strong>David Hume</strong> - The self is a bundle of perceptions and experiences.</p><p></p><p>MY EXPLANATION/ DEFINITION ABOUT THE SELF: Hume argued that the self was not a single entity, but rather a bundle of perceptions and experiences. He believed that the self was constantly changing and evolving as we experienced new things and accumulated more knowledge.</p><p></p><p>7. <strong>Immanuel Kant</strong> - The self is a unified consciousness that provides the basis for all knowledge and experience.</p><p></p><p>MY EXPLANATION/ DEFINITION ABOUT THE SELF: Kant believed that the self was a unified consciousness that provided the basis for all knowledge and experience. He argued that the self was necessary for us to make sense of the world around us and understand our place within it.</p><p></p><p>8. <strong>John Locke</strong> - The self is a tabula rasa or a blank slate that is shaped by experience.</p><p></p><p>MY EXPLANATION/ DEFINITION ABOUT THE SELF: Locke believed that the self was a blank slate that is shaped by experience.

Through this work, Ryle is thought to have accomplished two major tasks. First, he was seen to have put the final nail in the coffin of Cartesian dualism. Second, he is thought to have argued on behalf of, and suggested as dualism’s replacement, the doctrine known as philosophical (and sometimes analytical) behaviourism. Sometimes known as an “ordinary language”, sometimes as an “analytic” philosopher, Ryle—even when mentioned in the same breath as Wittgenstein and his followers—is considered to be on a different, somewhat idiosyncratic (and difficult to characterise), philosophical track.</p><p></p><p>Philosophical behaviourism has long been rejected; what was worth keeping has been appropriated by the philosophical doctrine of functionalism, which is the most widely accepted view in philosophy of mind today. It is a view that is thought to have saved the “reality” of the mental from the “eliminativist” or “fictionalist” tendencies of behaviourism while acknowledging the insight (often attributed to Ryle) that the mental is importantly related to behavioural output or response (as well as to stimulus or input). According to a reasonably charitable assessment, the best of Ryle’s lessons has long been assimilated while the problematic has been discarded. If there are considerations still brewing from the 1930s and 40s that would threaten the orthodoxy in contemporary philosophy of mind, these lie somewhere in work of Wittgenstein and his followers—not in Ryle.</p><p></p><p>But the view just outlined, though widespread, represents a fundamental misapprehension of Ryle’s work. First, Cartesianism is dead in only one of its ontological aspects: substance dualism may well have been repudiated but property dualism still claims a number of contemporary defenders. The problem of finding a place for the mental in the physical world, of accommodating the causal power of the mental, and of accounting for the phenomenal aspects of consciousness are all live problems in the philosophy of mind today because they share some of the doctrine’s ontological, epistemological, and semantic assumptions.</p><p></p><p></p><p>[tex]\huge\purple{\overline{\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad \ \ \}}}[/tex]</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>Gilbert Ryle (1900–1976) was a British philosopher, principally known for his critique of Cartesian dualism, for which he coined the phrase "ghost in the machine." He was a representative of the generation of British ordinary language philosophers who shared Ludwig Wittgenstein's approach to philosophical problems.</strong><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it </strong><strong>can</strong><strong> </strong><strong>help</strong></p><p><strong>#</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>0</strong><strong>_</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>w</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Gilbert Ryle was born in Brighton, Sussex, England on 19 August 1900. One of ten children, he came from a prosperous family and enjoyed a liberal and stimulating childhood and adolescence. His father was a general practitioner but had keen interests in philosophy and astronomy that he passed on to his children and an impressive library where Ryle enjoyed being an “omnivorous reader” (Ryle, 1970, 1). Educated at Brighton College (where later in life he would return as a governor) Ryle went to Queen’s College, Oxford in 1919 initially to study Classics, but he was quickly drawn to Philosophy, graduating in 1924 with first-class honours in the new Modern Greats School of Philosophy, Politics and Economics. While not particularly sporting, his undergraduate studies were relieved by rowing for his college eight, of which he was captain, and he was good enough to have trials for the University boat. After his graduation in 1924 he was appointed to a lectureship in Philosophy at Christ Church College and a year later became tutor. He would remain at Oxford for his entire academic career until his retirement in 1968; in 1945 he was elected to the Waynflete Chair of Metaphysical Philosophy. With the outbreak of war Ryle volunteered. He was commissioned in the Welsh Guards, serving in intelligence, and by the end of the War had been promoted to the rank of Major. He became the Editor of Mind after G.E. Moore’s retirement in 1947; a post he held until 1971. Ryle was unstinting in his advice and encouragement to generations of students. With colleagues he was “tolerant (and) uncensorious” (Warnock, xiv), but in philosophical debate he could turn into a formidable opponent, expressing an intense dislike of pomposity, pretence and jargon (Urmson, 271; Gallop, 228). He was also ever ready to challenge both the excessive veneration paid by others to Plato and Classical authors as well as the philosophical positions held by such contemporary colleagues as Collingwood in Oxford or Anderson in Australia. He befriended Wittgenstein whose work, if not his effect on colleagues and students, he greatly admired. “Outstandingly friendly (and) sociable” (Warnock, xiv), he is remembered as an entertaining conversationalist. Despite having turned away from literary studies during his first year at Oxford, sensing he had little aptitude for them, and even though he read little other than the novels of Jane Austen (about whom he wrote authoritatively) and P. G. Wodehouse, the style of Ryle’s writing is often literary and instantly recognizable even after a few sentences (Urmson, 271; Mabbott, 223). A confirmed bachelor, he lived after his retirement with his twin sister Mary in the Oxfordshire village of Islip. Gardening and walking gave him immense pleasure, as did his pipe. He died on 6 October 1976 at Whitby in Yorkshire after a day’s walking on the moors. “Philosophy irradiated his whole life” (Mabbott, 224). He is reputed to have said that the only completed portrait of him made him look like a “drowned German General” (Mabbott, 224).</p><p></p><p></p><p>When Ryle became a young don in the 1920s, philosophers could no longer “pretend that philosophy differed from physics, chemistry and biology by studying mental as opposed to material phenomena” (1971b, vii). Although the turn away from psychologism was laudable, philosophers succumbed instead to what Ryle considered to be a regrettable temptation to look for Objects which were neither mental nor material. Such objects were to be for philosophy what beetles and butterflies are for entomology:</p><p></p><p>Platonic Forms, Propositions, Intentional Objects, Logical Objects … [and even] Sense Data were recruited to appease our professional hankerings to have a subject matter of our own (1971b, vii).</p><p>Ryle’s campaign against the tendency of philosophers to “hypostasise their own terms of art” lasted throughout his career. Even his very first articles carried the “Occamizing” message that “[p]hilosophical problems are problems of a certain sort; they are not problems of an ordinary sort about special entities” (1971b, vii; these early articles include 1929, 1930a, 1933a, and 1933b).</p><p></p><p></p><br />
