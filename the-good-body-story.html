                                            EXPOSITION: Life SituationOnce upon a time, the member of the human body began to find fault with the belly,complaining that it led an idle and luxurious life while they themselves had to slavefor its support or minister to pleasure. So they formed a conspiracy and cut off itssupplies.The hands were no longer to carry food to the mouth, the mouth to receive thefood, or the teeth to chew it. But is not long before they grew listless and weak, andthe the whole body began to pine a way.Then the members were convinced that the belly too, cumbersome and useless as itseemed, exercised an important function of its own; that they could no more dowithout it than it could do without the; and that if the body was to enjoy good health,they must work together each in its prophere, for the common good of all.Guide Questions1.

                                            PENGUINS ANTICS
Penguins are birds that live in the coldest parts of the world. They are black with a white stomach and have small wings. They move across the ice by wadding slowly on their little feet with their wings. They move across the ice by waddling slowly on their feet without to the side. Surprisingly, Penguins cannot fly even though they have wings. They use their wings to balance them as they waddle across the ice. Their bodies are also very good at keeping the penguin 
warm in the cold weather. Penguins are very good at swimming and use the strength in their bodies to move easily through the water. Penguins need to be good swimmers because they eat mostly fish and sea animals. When they catch their food they swallow it whole! They also need to use their strong bodies to get away from seals and sharks because seals and sharks eat penguins. There are lots of different types of penguins and they come in all different sizes and shapes. We all need to make sure we take good care of our world because oil spills and global warming can destroy the penguin’s home.

When Subhadra was pregnant with Abhimanyu, Arjuna, one of the five Pandava brothers, decided to tell his wife about the Chakravyuh war technique.</p><p></p><p>Arjuna narrated to Subhadra how to break the Chakravyuh, a labyrinth formed by armed soldiers to trap the enemy, and enter it. Abhimanyu heard and memorized the entire process from inside Subhadra’s womb.</p><p>But by the time Arjuna told her about coming out of the Chakravyuh, Subhadra fell asleep. As a result, Abhimanyu learned only entering the labyrinth but couldn’t know how to come out of it. Later in life, when young Abhimanyu fought in the great Kurukṣhetra War of Mahabharata, he had to confront the enemy’s Chakravyuh formation. He could get into the formation, but could not come out. Abhimanyu took a chariot wheel and swung it around, fighting enemies unarmed.

                        Paragraph 1 (Introduction):<br /><br />Leo Tolstoy's "The Two Brothers" is a short story about two brothers who inherit their father's farm and learn to deal with their conflicting personalities and desires. The story is set in the countryside of Russia during the 19th century and explores themes of family, responsibility, and the pursuit of happiness.<br /><br />Paragraph 2 (Body):<br /><br />The main characters in "The Two Brothers" are not related to me, but I found their personalities relatable in many ways. While one brother is driven by a desire for success and wealth, the other is content with a simple life. This dichotomy reminded me of my own experiences with family and friends who have different priorities and values.<br />The setting of the story is effective in creating a vivid picture of life in rural Russia during the 19th century. Tolstoy's descriptions of the countryside and the changing seasons help to bring the story to life. For example, when describing the winter landscape, Tolstoy writes: "The white, untrodden snow stretched over the whole valley, reflecting the rays of the sun, and its cold, sparkling crystals seemed to penetrate the very soul."<br />The plot of "The Two Brothers" is interesting, but it may not be to everyone's taste. The story is slow-paced and focuses on the inner lives of the characters, rather than action or suspense. However, this allows for a deeper exploration of the themes of family, responsibility, and happiness. The climax of the story is unexpected and provides a satisfying conclusion.<br />The conflict in "The Two Brothers" is clear and realistic, as it deals with the struggle between two brothers who have different ideas about how to run their farm. This conflict is something that many people can relate to, as it is common for family members to have different goals and desires.<br />The theme of "The Two Brothers" is that happiness cannot be found through wealth and material possessions alone. This is demonstrated through the contrast between the two brothers, one of whom values success and wealth, while the other is content with a simple life. The story suggests that true happiness comes from living a fulfilling life that is in line with one's values and priorities.<br />Paragraph 3 (Conclusion):<br /><br />Overall, "The Two Brothers" is a well-written and thought-provoking story that explores important themes related to family, responsibility, and happiness. While it may not be to everyone's taste, the slow pace and emphasis on character development allow for a deeper exploration of these themes. The story has enduring value, as it provides a timeless lesson about the importance of living a fulfilling life that is true to one's values.<br />

Penguins are birds that live in the coldest parts of the world. They are black with a white stomach and have small wings. They move across the ice by wadding slowly on their little feet with their wings. They move across the ice by waddling slowly on their feet without to the side. Surprisingly, Penguins cannot fly even though they have wings. They use their wings to balance them as they waddle across the ice. Their bodies are also very good at keeping the penguin 
warm in the cold weather. Penguins are very good at swimming and use the strength in their bodies to move easily through the water. Penguins need to be good swimmers because they eat mostly fish and sea animals. When they catch their food they swallow it whole! They also need to use their strong bodies to get away from seals and sharks because seals and sharks eat penguins. There are lots of different types of penguins and they come in all different sizes and shapes. We all need to make sure we take good care of our world because oil spills and global warming can destroy the penguin’s home.
