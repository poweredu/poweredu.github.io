Do this in your notebook.     My favorite place in my mother's house is the dining room. Every year my mother s house is chosen, by all of our family members to host the holiday dinners and parties because of of how elegant her dining room is        As you walk thru the long narrow hallway on your way to the dining room you see the hudge pictures of family members hung on both sides of the smooth colorful wall. It seems like you're walking forever then you reach the door of the infamous dining room.       You re first greeted by the tall wide almond color and trimmed in gold door. The doorknob is always cold to touch like you re touching a black of ice. When you walk into the door the room is so cold, it feels like you re standing outside in a snow storm, in Alaska. However the smell that hits your nose is amazing.nonsense = reportcorrect answer = brainlest and follow☺​</a>

1. You are researching on an assignment in your subject in Media and Information Literacy. You came along an article online that amazingly can answer the research assignment perfectly well. You copy and pasted it into one great essay, complete with pictures and other visuals. You did not cite your references in order to impress your perfectionist and strict teacher.
2. A family friend, who also happens to be your classmate in one of your classes was
diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the
status of her health, including its severity, and asked you to refrain from spilling out the information outside of your family circle. In order to help her with her absences and academic standing, you told your class adviser about her health status.
3. You are living in a peaceful community within your barangay where everyone practically knows everyone. Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs. Upon investigation and personal interview, you found out that he is actually using marijuana because of an emotional problem within his family. You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem. True enough, he was sent to a rehabilitation center in order to undergo debriefing. The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open. Your friend’s family have branded you a traitor for helping the “arrest” of your friend and ultimately revealing their problems to the entire neighborhood.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Christian view of marriage is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ, as recorded in the Gospels, including the passage you referenced from Matthew 19:5-6. This passage highlights the importance of the union between a man and a woman in marriage and emphasizes the permanence and unity of the marriage bond.</p><p></p><p>Christianity teaches that marriage is a sacred covenant between a man and a woman, instituted by God, and should be a lifelong commitment. The Bible teaches that marriage is a reflection of God's love for His people and that the relationship between a husband and wife should be characterized by mutual love, respect, and self-sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>However, the issue of divorce has been a contentious one within Christianity. While Jesus taught that divorce was not part of God's original plan for marriage and that it should be avoided, He also recognized that it was sometimes necessary due to the hardness of people's hearts (Matthew 19:8).</p><p></p><p>In general, the Catholic Church and many other Christian denominations hold that marriage is a permanent and indissoluble union, except in cases of grave sin or the invalidity of the marriage itself. In cases where divorce is allowed, the Church encourages individuals to seek annulment, which is a process of determining whether the marriage was validly contracted in the first place.</p><p></p><p>While divorce and family breakdown can be difficult and painful, Christianity teaches that God's love and grace are available to all who seek Him. The Church also seeks to support and minister to individuals and families who are going through difficult times, offering pastoral care, counseling, and other resources to help them through their struggles.</p><br />

2. A family friend, who also happens to be your classmate in one of your classes was
diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the
status of her health, including its severity, and asked you to refrain from spilling out the information outside of your family circle. In order to help her with her absences and academic standing, you told your class adviser about her health status.
3. You are living in a peaceful community within your barangay where everyone practically knows everyone. Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs. Upon investigation and personal interview, you found out that he is actually using marijuana because of an emotional problem within his family. You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem. True enough, he was sent to a rehabilitation center in order to undergo debriefing. The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open. Your friend’s family have branded you a traitor for helping the “arrest” of your friend and ultimately revealing their problems to the entire neighborhood.</h2><br />

My favorite place in my mother's house is the dining room. Every year my mother s house is chosen, by all of our family
members to host the holiday dinners and parties because of how elegant her dining room is.
As you walk thru the long narrow hallway on your way to the dining room you see the huge pictures of family members
hung on both sides of the smooth colorful wall. It seems like you re walking forever then you reach the door of the infamous
dining room.
You re first greeted by the fall wide almond color and trimmed in gold door. The doorknob is always cold to touch like
you re touching a block of ice. When you walk into the door the room is so cold, it feels like you re standing outside in a snow
storm, in Alaska. However the smell that hits your nose is amazing. </h2><br />

Write your point of view as to each situation, taking into consideration the following mechanics in grading this activity: 1. You are researching on an assignment in your subject in Media and Information Literacy. You came along an article online that amazingly can answer the research assignment perfectly well. You copy and pasted it into one great essay, complete with pictures and other visuals. You did not cite your references in order to impress your perfectionist and strict teacher. 2. A family friend, who also happens to be your classmate in one of your classes was diagnosed with an incurable illness. Your close family ties enabled you to know the status of her health, including its severity, and asked you to refrain from spilling out the information outside of your family circle. In order to help her with her absences and academic standing, you told your class adviser about her health status. 3. You are living in a peaceful community within your barangay where everyone practically knows everyone. Lately, there have been rumors circulating around the neighborhood that one of your friends is into illegal drugs. Upon investigation and personal interview, you found out that he is actually using marijuana because of an emotional problem within his family. You decided to help him by enlisting the help of psychologists and authorities in order to help him rehabilitate and cope with the problem. True enough, he was sent to a rehabilitation center in order to undergo debriefing. The news spread like wildfire within the neighborhood and soon, his family’s problems was then discussed out in the open. Your friend’s family have branded you a traitor for helping the “arrest” of your friend and ultimately revealing their problems to the entire neighborhood.​</h2><br />
