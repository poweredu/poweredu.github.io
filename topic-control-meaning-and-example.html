Direction: Choose the best word inside the parenthesis ( ) to complete the concept of the following statement about 
developing a plan to enhance brain functions. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 
1. Mind (ability, power) is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess. 
2. Your mind mapping ability (declines, enhances) your brain functions. 
3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body and the (left, right) brain controls the left 
side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.
4. Everybody is expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is a need to enhance brain 
(development, functions). 
5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape 
your schedule and coursework, to suit your own (mind, personality) type. 
6. Remember that Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your brain. Mind 
mapping is a creative and logical means of (handwriting, note taking) that literally "maps out" your ideas. 
7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony (Buzan, Biazon).
8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will (guide, include) you in keeping you mind map connected 
to each other. 
9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mind map (easy, hard). They are the use of 
colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size. 
10. Getting information such as the brain (facts, parts) and enhancing our brain functions leads to a maximum 
‘Powers of the Mind’.

                                            What makes us yawn? Yawning is something that we cannot control. Even in the mother's womb, eleven-week-old babies have been observed to yawn. But why do we do it? One popular explanation for yawning is that a person may be tired or bored. Although many believe this to be true, it cannot explain why athletes yawn before an event or why dogs yawn before an attack. It is said that yawning is caused by a lack of oxygen and excess carbon dioxide. A good example of this is when we yawn in groups. We yawn because we are competing for air. Others even believe that we yawn to cool our brains off.

                            15. II. Concept Development 
Direction: Choose the best word inside the parenthesis ( ) to complete the concept of the following statement about 
developing a plan to enhance brain functions. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 
1. Mind (ability, power) is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess. 
2. Your mind mapping ability (declines, enhances) your brain functions. 
3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body and the (left, right) brain controls the left 
side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.
4. Everybody is expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is a need to enhance brain 
(development, functions). 
5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape 
your schedule and coursework, to suit your own (mind, personality) type. 
6. Remember that Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your brain. Mind 
mapping is a creative and logical means of (handwriting, note taking) that literally "maps out" your ideas. 
7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony (Buzan, Biazon).
8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will (guide, include) you in keeping you mind map connected 
to each other. 
9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mind map (easy, hard). They are the use of 
colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size. 
10. Getting information such as the brain (facts, parts) and enhancing our brain functions leads to a maximum 
‘Powers of the Mind’.
