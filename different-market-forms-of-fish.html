                            24. why do we need to know the different market forms of fish​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>It is important to study the characteristics and market forms of fish to be able to know if it is good or bad for us, if it is going to spoil, how to clean it, and more. It is because if we are going to eat seafoods like fish, we need to make sure that it is clean and safe.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>There is no hard and fast rule to that, except that someone is limited to the typical market form if they don't have access to whole fresh fish. Someone who catches their own fish can pretty much prepare it any way they like, and not be beholden to the typical presentation of that fish.<br />
