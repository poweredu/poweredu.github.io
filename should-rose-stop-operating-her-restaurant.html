                                            Case 1. Rose Restaurant: What Now My Love?
On any given day, Rose Restaurant is full of customers. It is not surprising because of two factors:
First, its location in the center of the commercial place in Tagum City, and second, the dynamism of its
owner and manager, Ms. Rosemarie Ginez. She is more than happy because she was able to realize her
dream of becoming successful in the food business. She now owns the building and the lot she used to
rent. Served in its large air-conditioned function hall are Native and Chinese delicacies. The place has
ample parking spaces for 20 cars.
It was in the restaurant where she first met her future husband. He is a government employee
and is assigned to work in Mati City. Rose’s husband is a native of Mati City and his widowed mother is
operating a big tourist destination in the place. Apart from owning of 10 resorts, his mother also owns one
half hectares of commercial land in the city’s business district.
Just as Rose was considering opening a branch of her restaurant in Davao City, her mother-in-
law died. Two weeks later, her husband informed her that being the only heir, he needs to move quickly
to Mati City and manage his mother’s business and other properties.
Even if her husband operates his mother’s business, Rose could still continue managing her
restaurant. Both of them, however, are aware of the difficulty of maintaining the two businesses which
are four hours away by car from each other. They will miss each other for days every week if they decide
to keep both businesses. Her husband is indifferent, however, on whatever Rose’s decision will be.
Rose is now mulling over her family’s chances of succeeding in business if she decides on
maintaining only the tourist destination business. Her decision-making is made more complicated when
her assistant reported a 49% increase in last year’s profits of her restaurant.

In her last days of pain and illness, she prayed, "Lord, increase my sufferings and with them increase your love in my hear Many miracles happen followed her death. She was beatified by Clement IX in 1667 and was canonized in 1671 by Clement X. She returned to her beloved Jesus on August 24, 1617.

                            2. Case 1. Rose Restaurant: What Now My Love?
On any given day, Rose Restaurant is full of customers. It is not surprising because of two factors:
First, its location in the center of the commercial place in Tagum City, and second, the dynamism of its
owner and manager, Ms. Rosemarie Ginez. She is more than happy because she was able to realize her
dream of becoming successful in the food business. She now owns the building and the lot she used to
rent. Served in its large air-conditioned function hall are Native and Chinese delicacies. The place has
ample parking spaces for 20 cars.
It was in the restaurant where she first met her future husband. He is a government employee
and is assigned to work in Mati City. Rose’s husband is a native of Mati City and his widowed mother is
operating a big tourist destination in the place. Apart from owning of 10 resorts, his mother also owns one
half hectares of commercial land in the city’s business district.
Just as Rose was considering opening a branch of her restaurant in Davao City, her mother-in-
law died. Two weeks later, her husband informed her that being the only heir, he needs to move quickly
to Mati City and manage his mother’s business and other properties.
Even if her husband operates his mother’s business, Rose could still continue managing her
restaurant. Both of them, however, are aware of the difficulty of maintaining the two businesses which
are four hours away by car from each other. They will miss each other for days every week if they decide
to keep both businesses. Her husband is indifferent, however, on whatever Rose’s decision will be.
Rose is now mulling over her family’s chances of succeeding in business if she decides on
maintaining only the tourist destination business. Her decision-making is made more complicated when
her assistant reported a 49% increase in last year’s profits of her restaurant.
Guide Questions:

                            8. On a given day, Rose Restaurant is full of customers. It is not surprising because of two factors: first, its location in the center of the commercial district in Santiago City, and second, the dynamism of its owner and manager, Ms. Rosemarie Ginez. She is more than happy because she was able to realize her dream of becoming successful in the food business. She now owns the building and the lot she used to rent. Served in its large air-conditioned functions hall are native and Chinese delicacies. The place has ample parking space for 20 cars.	It was on the restaurant where she first met her future husband. He is government employee and is assigned to work nearby town. Rose’s husband is a native of San Jose City and his widowed mother is operating a big palay trading firm. Apart from owning 10 cargo trucks, his mother also owns one and a half hectares of commercial land in the city’s business district.	Just as Rose was considering opening a branch of her restaurant in Cauayan City, her mother-in-law died. Two weeks later, her husband informed her that being the heir, he needs to move quickly to San Jose City and manage his mother’s business and other properties.	Even if her husband operates her mother’s business, Rose could still continue managing her restaurant. Both of them, however, are aware of the difficulty of maintaining two businesses which are four hours away by car from each other. They will miss each other for days every week if they decide to keep both businesses. Her husband is indifferent, however, on whatever Rose’s decision will be. 	Rose in now mulling over her family’s chances of succeeding in business if she decides on maintaining only the palay trading firm. Her decision-making is made more complicated when her assistant reported 49% increase in last year’s profits of her restaurant. Question:*If you were Rose, what additional information would you need before making a decision?Answer:​</h2><br />

                            9. Can you think of other forms or documents that should be used in a restaurant operation​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Reduces The Learning Time Of The Employees</p><p></p><p>Mostly, the new employees on board take a long time to get accustomed to the operations of your restaurant. No matter how experienced your new staff is, since every restaurant has its way to go about with its operations, the new team might take time to get in tune with it.</p><p></p><p>Now, imagine, if you have a comprehensive and well-written and a well-researched restaurant operations manual, you can easily hand them over to the new employees on board. They can then easily read them and understand what is expected of them and how they should go about with their work. For example, once you have assigned your new employees their job responsibilities, it should not surprise you if they happen to forget their duties. Here comes the importance of a restaurant operations manual. </p><p></p><p>You can ask these employees to read the manual every day and tick the tasks they have done. This will help them to self-train themselves and will help you to save a lot of your time and energy. It acts as a ready reckoner for daily tasks.</p><p>2. Makes Your Employees All-Rounders</p><p></p><p>There can be various reasons for which a key staff member might be unavailable to come to work. Does this mean that the restaurant operations would come to a standstill? Such a situation has the potential to hamper the activities of your restaurant for the day, which will have negative consequences on the restaurant’s sales.</p><p></p><p>In such a time of crisis, by referring to the restaurant operating manual, one can fill in the place and carry on with the restaurant operations on an immediate basis. This will ensure that all your employees are trained in all sections of your restaurant operations.</p><p>3. Helps In Maintaining The Standard and Consistency Of The Operations</p><p></p><p>You can have a detailed guideline on how you should go about with the operations of the restaurant, which every employee must adhere to. Once you have this restaurant operations manual in place, then you can very easily maintain the standard and consistency of your restaurant operations. Consistency will be maintained while preparing a dish while serving the guests and cleaning the kitchen and the tables. Once you have consistency in food and customer service, it will help you to attract and retain customers more efficiently.</p><p>4. Delegating Tasks Become Easy</p><p></p><p>A well-written restaurant operations manual will include an organogram of the business, as well as have a short job description and contact details for each staff member on board. Hence, if you need to delegate a specific task, you can see at a glance who will be able to help you or advise you. This will help you to stop micromanaging, as it will be clear who is responsible for what.</p><p>5. Helps In Increasing Customer Delight Through Consistent Service</p><p></p><p>Your restaurant operations manual will clearly define and set a standard way of dealing with the customers, with their queries, refunds, promotions, follow-up, and more. This will ensure that all your clients are treated fairly and equally, enhancing their interactions with you. Once you deliver consistent customer service, you will be able to create a band of happy and loyal customers; it will automatically help you to keep your cash registers overflowing. </p><p></p><p>Consistency and efficiency are the two most important factors for a successful restaurant. By providing a comprehensive restaurant operations manual to your staff, your staff will have a clear understanding of what is expected of them, and it will help minimize the chances of mistakes or inconsistencies that tend to happen when written documentation is</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
