Pour the following liquids in to the 1000 ml graduated cylinder in order gentlyassisted by the stirring rod; honey, corn syrup, milk, dish soap, water and cooking oil. Put the stirring rod in the graduated cylinder and pour the liquid in the cylinder guided by the stirring rod it will act like as a bridge for the liquids. 5. Place the 1000 ml graduated cylinder in a stable place or table to quicken the separation of layers. Wait until layer of the liquids appear, while waiting for the separation of layers get 1/4 of the beef cube and form a ball out of it. 6. Drop the beef ball in to the layered liquids and write down all of your observations. Be attentive in doing this step because it can only be done once.​</a>

Wash pots and pans last. Soak them first. Wash the pans thoroughly and don't forget toclean the bottoms. If anything, was burnt or overcooked to pots or casserole dishes, put alittle extra soap and water in it and let it standwhile you wash the other dishes. Take note that any oil residue left will lead to burn food during the next cooking session. There should be no visible matter and no "greasy" feel. Run a hand over the dish to ensurethat they are thoroughly cleaned. If there are still some greases remaining, consider rewashing the item. Rinse out brush, sponge and allow to dry. Sterilize your equipment often using boiling water with bleach. When a sponge or brush starts to smellunpleasant, throw it away. Wash the lightest soiled items first start with glasses, cups, and flatware. Soap each piece individually and rinse inhot water. Lay your dishes out on the a rock to air dust dry or wipe them with clean towel.​</h2><br />
