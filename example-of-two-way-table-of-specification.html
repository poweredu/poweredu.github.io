"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY IV. Read and analyze the following literature review very carefully. Then,
complete the table that follows.
Kram (1985) has proposed that mentoring relationships develop and mature
over time, providing different levels of mentoring functions as they progress
through a sequence of four distinct phases: initiation, cultivation, separation,
and redefinition. During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin
initial interactions that involve learning the other’s personal style and work habits.
He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized by
musings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and
visibility, the mentor embodies as fantasized role model with whom the protégé
begins to identify and develops positive expectations about career
development. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then
progresses to the cultivation phase, in which career development, role modeling
and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram
(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and
protégé deepens and intimacy increases during this phase. This phase may last
from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentor
promotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor,
and the mentor gains loyalty and support of the protégé and feelings that his or
her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the
cultivation phase. The third phase, separation, involves a structural and
psychological disconnection between the mentor and the protégé when
functions provided by the mentor decrease, and the protégé becomes
independent. In the redefinition phase, the mentor and protégé frequently
develop a relationship that is more peer-like, characterized by mutual support
and informal contact. While career and psychosocial functions are less evident,
sponsorship from a distance, occasional counseling and coaching and ongoing
friendship continue. Hay (1995) believes that mentoring process is underpinned by
the following principles: recognizing that people are okay, realizing that people
can change and want to grow, understanding how people learn, recognizing
individual differences, empowering through personal and professional
development, developing competence, encouraging collaboration not
competition, encouraging scholarship and a sense of inquiry, searching for new
ideas, theories and knowledge and reflecting on past experiences as key to
understanding.
According to Mackimm, et al (2003) mentoring relationship is a special
relationship where two people make real connection. It is a protected
relationship in which learning and experimentation occur through analysis,
examination, reexamination and reflection on practice, situations, problems,
mistakes and successes (of both the mentors and the mentees) to identify
learning opportunities and gaps. According to Yang (2006), mentoring
relationships range from loosely defined, informal collegial associations in which
a mentee learns by observation and example to structured formal agreements
between expert and novice co-mentors where each develops professionally
through the two-way transfer of experience and perspective. Whether the
relationship is formal or informal, the goal of mentoring is to provide career
advice as well as both professional and personal enrichment. It is important that
the mentor and the mentee have a clear grasp of the mentoring process for
maximum benefits of this special relationship. For mentoring to be effective, the
mentee together with the mentor needs to reflect on the experiences in school
and attempts to understand the experience through analysis and
conceptualization. The individual makes choices based on analyzing the
implications. She/he identifies options, decides on what to do next and
undergoes another experience.
Mentoring relationship is classified as formal or informal, and short term or long
term (Goodyear, 2006). Formal mentoring is usually mandatory and
institutionalized by the school or agency. The meetings are determined,
monitored and evaluated based on clearly articulated goals and milestones.
Informal mentoring relationship is more spontaneous and springs from the
mentee’s intrinsic desire to become better. The choice of the mentor is based on
trust and confidence. Another type of mentoring is the duration of the
relationship which can be short term and long term. A short term mentoring
usually addresses a set of specific needs. Long term mentoring is based on the
broad based goals incorporated in the professional development career of the
institution or agency. Whether the mentoring relationship is formal or informal,
short term or long term, literature proves that mentoring has improved the
teacher’s personal artistry and professional skill in the workplace.

"Pliant like a bamboo"
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was the stronger of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
The wind blew hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. But finally its root gave way, and it tumbled down.
The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protestations, but let the wind have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
The Filipino is like the bamboo tree. He knows that he is not strong enough, to withstand the onslaught of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protestations.
And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And, when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.
The Americans took place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos to their mode of living and thinking. The Filipinos embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniard’s vague promises hereafter.
Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence—rude, relentless, cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low, to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity”.
And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
For the Filipino would welcome any kind of life that the gods would offer him. That is why he is contented and happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision; but today, well-lived, makes every yesterday a dream of happiness, and tomorrow is a vision of hope.
This may give you the idea that the Filipino is a philosopher. Well he is. He has not evolved a body of philosophical doctrines. Much less has he put them down into a book, like Kant for example, or Santayana or Confucius. But he does have a philosophical outlook on life.
He has a saying that life is like a wheel. Sometimes it is up, sometimes it is down. The monsoon season comes, and he has to go undercover. But then the sun comes out again. The flowers bloom, and the birds sing in the trees. You cut off the branches of a tree, and, while the marks of the bolo* are still upon it, it begins to shoot forth-new branches—branches that are the promise of new color, new fragrance, and new life.

                            3. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</h2><br />

                            5. ACTIVITY IV. Read and analyze the following literature review very carefully. Then,
complete the table that follows.
Kram (1985) has proposed that mentoring relationships develop and mature
over time, providing different levels of mentoring functions as they progress
through a sequence of four distinct phases: initiation, cultivation, separation,
and redefinition. During the initiation phase, the mentor and the protégé begin
initial interactions that involve learning the other’s personal style and work habits.
He described the first six to 12 months of a relationship as characterized by
musings that protégés and mentors providing coaching, challenging work and
visibility, the mentor embodies as fantasized role model with whom the protégé
begins to identify and develops positive expectations about career
development. If the relationship matures past the initiation phase, it then
progresses to the cultivation phase, in which career development, role modeling
and psychosocial mentoring functions are proposed to be at their highest. Kram
(1985) further proposed that the emotional bond between the mentor and
protégé deepens and intimacy increases during this phase. This phase may last
from two to five years as the protégé learns from the mentor and the mentor
promotes and protects the protégé. Protégés gain knowledge from the mentor,
and the mentor gains loyalty and support of the protégé and feelings that his or
her values, ideas and work habits may be passed on to the protégé during the
cultivation phase. The third phase, separation, involves a structural and
psychological disconnection between the mentor and the protégé when
functions provided by the mentor decrease, and the protégé becomes
independent. In the redefinition phase, the mentor and protégé frequently
develop a relationship that is more peer-like, characterized by mutual support
and informal contact. While career and psychosocial functions are less evident,
sponsorship from a distance, occasional counseling and coaching and ongoing
friendship continue. Hay (1995) believes that mentoring process is underpinned by
the following principles: recognizing that people are okay, realizing that people
can change and want to grow, understanding how people learn, recognizing
individual differences, empowering through personal and professional
development, developing competence, encouraging collaboration not
competition, encouraging scholarship and a sense of inquiry, searching for new
ideas, theories and knowledge and reflecting on past experiences as key to
understanding.
According to Mackimm, et al (2003) mentoring relationship is a special
relationship where two people make real connection. It is a protected
relationship in which learning and experimentation occur through analysis,
examination, reexamination and reflection on practice, situations, problems,
mistakes and successes (of both the mentors and the mentees) to identify
learning opportunities and gaps. According to Yang (2006), mentoring
relationships range from loosely defined, informal collegial associations in which
a mentee learns by observation and example to structured formal agreements
between expert and novice co-mentors where each develops professionally
through the two-way transfer of experience and perspective. Whether the
relationship is formal or informal, the goal of mentoring is to provide career
advice as well as both professional and personal enrichment. It is important that
the mentor and the mentee have a clear grasp of the mentoring process for
maximum benefits of this special relationship. For mentoring to be effective, the
mentee together with the mentor needs to reflect on the experiences in school
and attempts to understand the experience through analysis and
conceptualization. The individual makes choices based on analyzing the
implications. She/he identifies options, decides on what to do next and
undergoes another experience.
Mentoring relationship is classified as formal or informal, and short term or long
term (Goodyear, 2006). Formal mentoring is usually mandatory and
institutionalized by the school or agency. The meetings are determined,
monitored and evaluated based on clearly articulated goals and milestones.
Informal mentoring relationship is more spontaneous and springs from the
mentee’s intrinsic desire to become better. The choice of the mentor is based on
trust and confidence. Another type of mentoring is the duration of the
relationship which can be short term and long term. A short term mentoring
usually addresses a set of specific needs. Long term mentoring is based on the
broad based goals incorporated in the professional development career of the
institution or agency. Whether the mentoring relationship is formal or informal,
short term or long term, literature proves that mentoring has improved the
teacher’s personal artistry and professional skill in the workplace.
