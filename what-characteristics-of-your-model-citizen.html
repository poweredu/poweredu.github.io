                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a saying goes, a difficult situation brings out the true nature of a person. It can either make o break him. It defines a person and will show his or her true colors. Your initial response to a crisis will measure your leadership skills, your personality, your faith, and your courage.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, it is easier to lay out the characteristics that a person should have in times of crisis. But practically speaking, the question can only be answered during the actual outbreak of a crisis. To answer the given question, I believe that the following characteristics should be remembered by a person in handling a crisis:</p><p></p><p><strong>Humility.</strong> Accept that you can only do so much and that you will be needing help from others.</p><p><strong>Courage.</strong> Crisis usually require fast decision making and you will be needing to take calculated risks</p><p><strong>p</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>b</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>m</strong><strong>-</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>v</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>attitude.</strong> Focus on solutions instead of pointing the blame to other people</p><p><strong>kindness</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>compassion.</strong> When a crisis involves the lives of other people, you should advance what is most favorable for mankind</p><p><strong>Leadership.</strong> You must have a can-do attitude and be willing to carry your people and stay with them no matter how hard the situation may get</p><br />
