DUKAS JARA Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Stoff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think 2005 are nice places for animals to her if you do. Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. CALA The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so that they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are raised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius. ich 63​</a>

Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Staff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so hat they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are aised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius.. Baby animals attract more visitors than older animals. Killing an adult animal opens up space and esources to bring in a younger animal. That animal can draw bigger crowds and more money. That is the eal reason Marius was killed. The zoo made less money as he grew up. People were more interested in Marius when he was baby than when he became an adult. The second reason zoos should be banned is that they rarely help endangered animals return to heir original habitats. A report by National Geographic found that most zoos do not have any contact with introduction programs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a nonprofit organization that fights for nimal rights. According to them, fewer than one-fifth of the animals in United States zoos are actually ndangered. When animal species is endangered, it is at risk of dying out completely. Zoos spend tons of money building enclosures for animals. Yet, they do almost nothing to restore wild habitats or to stop oaching in wild environments. Finally, zoos simply do not have enough resources to properly house the creatures that live there. Vild habitats cannot be remade in spaces where animals are held captive. An opinion article called "All e Reasons Why Zoos Should Be Banned" was published by Vice in 2015. It said polar bears in zoos ave up to 18,000 times less space than they do in the wild. Animals cannot be healthy in zoos. Seventy-five percent of elephants kept in zoos are overweight cording to the article. Forty percent of lion cubs pass away before their full life span. This data support e argument that zoos do not have the resources to support animals' well-being, health and populations. he British Broadcasting Company (BBC) has reported that around 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed eac ar in zoos in Europe. Many more animals show signs of zoochosis. This is a psychological disorder served in zoo animals that leads to pacing, bar biting and other repeated behaviors. Zoos should make an effort to reintroduce the animals they own into natural habitats. Some coul returned to the wild. However, many zoo animals would not be able to survive in the wild. These imals should then be sent to sanctuaries where they can live peacefully. Zoos inhumanely source and breed animals. They do little to improve wildlife populations. Zoos -o do little to help the public understand their impact on wildlife. Also, they cannot provide what is eded to support animals' lives. Zoos should reintroduce their animals into the wild or into sanctuary tings. This will have the added benefit of relieving zoos of the burden of keeping these animals alive n't that a win-win?​</a>

DUKAS JARA Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Stoff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think 2005 are nice places for animals to her if you do. Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. CALA The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so that they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are raised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius. ich 63​</h2><br />

                            13. we should abolish zoos and ocean parks.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The abolishment of zoo and ocean parks might not be the best for the welfare of land and marine animals. In today's era, the wild has been inhospitable to many animal and marine creatures as pollution, overhunting, fewer food sources, calamities such as forest fires and competition with humans make it harder for wildlife to survive on their own. The most significant factor among these is overhunting. In the wild, animals are prone to overhunting by humans for food, parts (such as rhino horn, ivory tusks, or whale's ambergris and blubber) that it would be safer for animals to be taken cared of by more responsible humans than be left in the wild.</p><p>A better compromise would be <strong>safaris</strong>. In a safari setting, land animals are not necessary caged for the viewing pleasure of humans, The land area is vast enough to permit the animals to roam. A safari is modeled to be as exact as the animals' habitat as much as possible, minus the threat of predators and human poachers. In this setting, trained rangers, biologists, and veterinarians are also on call to ensure the well being on the animals. While technically still on display, animals in a Safari are well fed, well taken cared of, and are more protected that their counterparts in the outdoors.</p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: A high temperature is called a fever (or sometimes a high fever). Fever itself is not an illness. A fever is usually a symptom of an underlying condition, most often an infection.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What isa fever?</strong></p><p><strong>Your body temperature fluctuates slightly throughout the day. A high temperature is also known as a fever. Generally, a fever is a rise of body temperature above the normal daily variation. Normal temperature varies depending on the person, the body site where temperature is measured, and the time of day.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What temperature is a fever?</strong></p><p><strong>The actual temperature causing a fever varies between different people and depends on what their usual temperature is. It is usually agreed that a person with a temperature of 38°C or higher has a fever. However, a temperature over 37.5°C can often be considered to be a fever in many children. Fevers can occur in children and adults and can be very common. Fevers are often accompanied by sweating.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>#Feelgoodtohelpother</strong></p><p></p><br />

Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Staff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so hat they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are aised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius.. Baby animals attract more visitors than older animals. Killing an adult animal opens up space and esources to bring in a younger animal. That animal can draw bigger crowds and more money. That is the eal reason Marius was killed. The zoo made less money as he grew up. People were more interested in Marius when he was baby than when he became an adult. The second reason zoos should be banned is that they rarely help endangered animals return to heir original habitats. A report by National Geographic found that most zoos do not have any contact with introduction programs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a nonprofit organization that fights for nimal rights. According to them, fewer than one-fifth of the animals in United States zoos are actually ndangered. When animal species is endangered, it is at risk of dying out completely. Zoos spend tons of money building enclosures for animals. Yet, they do almost nothing to restore wild habitats or to stop oaching in wild environments. Finally, zoos simply do not have enough resources to properly house the creatures that live there. Vild habitats cannot be remade in spaces where animals are held captive. An opinion article called "All e Reasons Why Zoos Should Be Banned" was published by Vice in 2015. It said polar bears in zoos ave up to 18,000 times less space than they do in the wild. Animals cannot be healthy in zoos. Seventy-five percent of elephants kept in zoos are overweight cording to the article. Forty percent of lion cubs pass away before their full life span. This data support e argument that zoos do not have the resources to support animals' well-being, health and populations. he British Broadcasting Company (BBC) has reported that around 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed eac ar in zoos in Europe. Many more animals show signs of zoochosis. This is a psychological disorder served in zoo animals that leads to pacing, bar biting and other repeated behaviors. Zoos should make an effort to reintroduce the animals they own into natural habitats. Some coul returned to the wild. However, many zoo animals would not be able to survive in the wild. These imals should then be sent to sanctuaries where they can live peacefully. Zoos inhumanely source and breed animals. They do little to improve wildlife populations. Zoos -o do little to help the public understand their impact on wildlife. Also, they cannot provide what is eded to support animals' lives. Zoos should reintroduce their animals into the wild or into sanctuary tings. This will have the added benefit of relieving zoos of the burden of keeping these animals alive n't that a win-win?​</h2><br />
