                                            What I Have Learned 1. The artworks and styles of the past have evolved and have adapted to a dynamic changing world, a world immersed in the latest technology and emerging ideologies to become the Contemporary Art of today. 2 Contemporary Art refers to art of any form and genre that produced in our contemporary time, simply put as "art created today." 3. Genres are categories of artistic creation and are characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. 4. Contemporary Art is expressions of the artist's thoughts and feelings based on their experience of the here and now which current events, issues and social concerns affecting the society where the artist lives in. 5. Contemporary Philippine artists hail from the different regions of the country and they use a wide variety of art media in their creations. These are materials that are readily available in the locality where the artist resides. 6 Contemporary Arts have different elements that are put together to come up with a distinct artwork like Performance, Appropriation, Technology, Hybridity and Space. (Mnemonics: PATHS) 7. The distinct features of Contemporary Philippine Art include Communal, Holistic, Intuitive, Multi-focal, Integrative and Creative Process. (Mnemonics: CHIMIC) 8 Contemporary Philippine Art considers not only the artist but also the participation of the community through the viewers wherein the experience is not solely confined to the creator of the art but also to the viewer of the art. 9. Integrative Art comes in different sizes and shapes, forms and styles as observed in Junk Art which is a sculptural rendition using discarded or used materials. 10. The combination of resourcefulness and creativity can bring out the artist in everyone.​</a>

The artworks and styles of the past have evolved and have adapted to a dynamic changing world, a world immersed in the latest technology and emerging ideologies to become the Contemporary Art of today. 2 Contemporary Art refers to art of any form and genre that produced in our contemporary time, simply put as "art created today." 3. Genres are categories of artistic creation and are characterized by similarities in form, style, or subject matter. 4. Contemporary Art is expressions of the artist's thoughts and feelings based on their experience of the here and now which current events, issues and social concerns affecting the society where the artist lives in. 5. Contemporary Philippine artists hail from the different regions of the country and they use a wide variety of art media in their creations. These are materials that are readily available in the locality where the artist resides. 6 Contemporary Arts have different elements that are put together to come up with a distinct artwork like Performance, Appropriation, Technology, Hybridity and Space. (Mnemonics: PATHS) 7. The distinct features of Contemporary Philippine Art include Communal, Holistic, Intuitive, Multi-focal, Integrative and Creative Process. (Mnemonics: CHIMIC) 8 Contemporary Philippine Art considers not only the artist but also the participation of the community through the viewers wherein the experience is not solely confined to the creator of the art but also to the viewer of the art. 9. Integrative Art comes in different sizes and shapes, forms and styles as observed in Junk Art which is a sculptural rendition using discarded or used materials. 10. The combination of resourcefulness and creativity can bring out the artist in everyone.​</h2><br />

Tinalik baskets - CAR<p>From small woven jars to portable lunchboxes, baskets come in a variety of shapes and sizes. The Cordillera Central refers to the island of Luzon in the Philippines' northernmost mountains. For many years, basketry was a vital component of every aspect of daily life in this region. Many traditional basket shapes are still in existence today solely because of foreigners' interest in Philippine handicrafts.</p>2. Pastillas wrapper - Bulacan<p>Pastillas are a class of milk-based sweets that were invented in the Philippine town of San Miguel, Bulacan Province. They are also known as pastillas de leche (lit., Milk Pills) or pastiyema. Making pastillas spread from San Miguel to other Philippine areas like Cagayan and Masbate. Refined sugar and calamansi juice are also included when creating pastillas.</p>3. Giant Lantern Festival - Pampaga<p>The Philippines' City of San Fernando, Pampanga, hosts the annual Giant Lantern Festival (Kapampangan: Ligligan Parul) in the middle of December. A competition of enormous parol lanterns is part of the festivities. The city is known as the "Christmas Capital of the Philippines" due to the success of the festival.</p>4. Inabel fabric - Iloco<p>One of the numerous things that make the Philippine province of Ilocos proud is the inabel. Cat's paws, fans, stars, and windows are examples of common patterns. However, inabel is specifically used in the context of weaving to describe material that is clearly of Ilocano origin.</p>5. Tattoo Art - CAR<p>In the Philippines' Cordillera, tattoos are commonly referred to as "batok." In the sixteenth century, the Bontok, Ifugao, and Kalinga tribes also participated in the activity. Other Cordilleran languages have regional counterparts. But a tattoo artist may be both.</p>6. Singkaban Festival - Bulacan<p>The Singkaban Festival is a well-known celebration in the province of Bulacan.  "Bagong Bulakenyo: maka-Diyos, makatao at makakalikasan" is the theme of the festival. A festival of arts and culture called Singkaban is held in celebration of the province's patron saint, Our Lady of Victory.</p>7. Paoay Church -  Iloco<p>The Paoay Church, sometimes referred to as the Saint Augustine Church or Iglesia de San Agustin de Paoay, is a Roman Catholic church located in the Philippine province of Ilocos Norte's Municipality of Paoay.  The Paoay Church is a Roman Catholic church located in the Philippine province of Ilocos Norte. The church, which was finished in 1710, is renowned for its distinctive architecture. It was recognized as a National Cultural Treasure by the Philippine government in 1973 and as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1993.</p>8. Banaue Rice Terraces - CAR<p>The Rice Terraces of the Philippine Cordilleras are a series of rice terraces on the island of Luzon in the Philippines. They were the first property to be listed in the World Heritage List's cultural landscape category. Intricate irrigation systems, water collection from mountaintop forests, and a sophisticated agricultural system are all part of the Ifugao complex of stone or mud walls.</p>9. Bakwat - Cagayan Valley<p>We are proud to contribute our many artistic creations to our country as proud Ilocanos, and we are proud of our traditions and cultures.  Bakwat Ilocanos: We are proud to contribute our many artistic creations to our country. Bakwat, which was popular in the province of Nueva Viscaya, Cagayan Valley, symbolizes the joy that every mother experiences after giving birth because it is a gift from their God.</p>10. Ikat weaving - CAR<p>Ikat, which in Indonesian means "to knot or to bind," has a Philippine variation that is renowned for its vibrant colors and eye-catching patterns. The Ifugao tribes and other ethnic groups in Mindanao mostly conduct Philippine ikat weaving in the Cordilleras of the Philippines.</p><p></p><p>More information related to Philiphines arts you can get at the link:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/889050</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/1528161</p><p>#SPJ1</p><br />
