At the school wide level, teachers and staff create a positive school culture by clearly defining positive expectations that are taught to all students and adults (Bradshaw, 2014).__________ 6. Teachers should assume that students know the appropriate and expected classroom behaviors. Instead, teachers should make it a priority to help their students understand what appropriate classroom behaviors are and make this information explicit.__________ 7. Make your classroom goals easy to understand and measurable (e.g., if your goal is to "be respectful" make sure your students know what that means. Provide them examples of negative behaviors that you expect from them).__________ 8. Most classroom teachers have trained in functional assessment or analysis of behavior, so it is important that they consult with their colleagues (e.g., school psychologists, special education teachers) who have expertise in this area. __________ 9. Large group instruction can be established for students who need to focus on specific skills to improve and manage their classroom behavior.__________ 10. Research indicates that classroom management systems are effective in managing student behavior and learning because they sustain an orderly learning environment for students, enhance students' academic skills and competencies, and further social and emotional development.​</a>

                                            Example ScenarioThe College of Information Technology and Computer Studies has a large numberof student population in the university. Managing an IT student and bringing togetherdepartments and other colleges to achieve the mission is always a big challenge for theThe management. Most are transferees, irregular students and with failed subjectaffected in this situation because they need to provide a copy of grades during advisingperiod and manually write it on the evaluation checklist to monitor their performancegrade in every semester before processing the enrolment.The college coordinators who have an access to verify, update and monitoring thestudent checklists. This checklist is used to back-up the Microsoft Access database thatuses to record the advising record. During the enrolment, the coordinators runs a reportthat will print out the evaluation checklist for the day. Not only does to maintain theevaluation database, but it also uses a copy of grades to validate the grade of the student.Although the MIS enrolment system supports the student viewing of gradesinformation, the Coordinators has noticed some drawbacks. On particular situation the evaluation for the courses have conflicted with missing subject to enrol due toCurriculum used by the student and will cause to failure of completion to the courseprogram. CITCS will like to get information about the automatic assessment of thestudent evaluation of grades per semester. They have been talking about either updating the system or replacing it with a newinformation system that would meet the current and future needs but needs more detailson which option is feasible for the advising procedures. Your tasks is to help come upwith a plan to address these issues.Project AnalysisWrite one-page review and observation in the CITCS Advisingprocedures for enrolment with the intent of improving it through standardmethodology. For this study, provide some discretion as to how would like tostructure the presentation and must address the following requirements abouteach step in the systems analysis design process: a. Planning: Define the scope of the problem.b. Requirements: Justify the functional requirements. Explain what documentation will be used to analyze the needs of the end users to ensure the new system can meet their expectations?c. Design: Use the information that you received from the system requirement documentation to explain how you will design the new or updated system. What are the necessary specifications and operations of the user interface that will meet the functional requirements? Will you use a Flowchart or any presentation diagram.</a>

Effective classroom management principles work across almost all subject areas and grade levels (Brophy, 2006; Lewis, et al., 2006).__________ 2. Although effective classroom management produces a variety of positive outcomes for students, according to a 2006 survey of pre-K through grade 12 teachers conducted by APA, teachers report a lack of support in implementing classroom management strategies.__________ 3. Chaotic classroom environments are a large issue for teachers and can contribute to high teacher stress and burnout rates.__________ 4. It is important to use effective classroom management strategies at the universal level in a tiered model, as they serve as both prevention and intervention methods that promote positive outcomes for teachers. __________ 5. At the school wide level, teachers and staff create a positive school culture by clearly defining positive expectations that are taught to all students and adults (Bradshaw, 2014).__________ 6. Teachers should assume that students know the appropriate and expected classroom behaviors. Instead, teachers should make it a priority to help their students understand what appropriate classroom behaviors are and make this information explicit.__________ 7. Make your classroom goals easy to understand and measurable (e.g., if your goal is to "be respectful" make sure your students know what that means. Provide them examples of negative behaviors that you expect from them).__________ 8. Most classroom teachers have trained in functional assessment or analysis of behavior, so it is important that they consult with their colleagues (e.g., school psychologists, special education teachers) who have expertise in this area. __________ 9. Large group instruction can be established for students who need to focus on specific skills to improve and manage their classroom behavior.__________ 10. Research indicates that classroom management systems are effective in managing student behavior and learning because they sustain an orderly learning environment for students, enhance students' academic skills and competencies, and further social and emotional development.​</h2><br />

                            21. Example ScenarioThe College of Information Technology and Computer Studies has a large numberof student population in the university. Managing an IT student and bringing togetherdepartments and other colleges to achieve the mission is always a big challenge for theThe management. Most are transferees, irregular students and with failed subjectaffected in this situation because they need to provide a copy of grades during advisingperiod and manually write it on the evaluation checklist to monitor their performancegrade in every semester before processing the enrolment.The college coordinators who have an access to verify, update and monitoring thestudent checklists. This checklist is used to back-up the Microsoft Access database thatuses to record the advising record. During the enrolment, the coordinators runs a reportthat will print out the evaluation checklist for the day. Not only does to maintain theevaluation database, but it also uses a copy of grades to validate the grade of the student.Although the MIS enrolment system supports the student viewing of gradesinformation, the Coordinators has noticed some drawbacks. On particular situation the evaluation for the courses have conflicted with missing subject to enrol due toCurriculum used by the student and will cause to failure of completion to the courseprogram. CITCS will like to get information about the automatic assessment of thestudent evaluation of grades per semester. They have been talking about either updating the system or replacing it with a newinformation system that would meet the current and future needs but needs more detailson which option is feasible for the advising procedures. Your tasks is to help come upwith a plan to address these issues.Project AnalysisWrite one-page review and observation in the CITCS Advisingprocedures for enrolment with the intent of improving it through standardmethodology. For this study, provide some discretion as to how would like tostructure the presentation and must address the following requirements abouteach step in the systems analysis design process: a. Planning: Define the scope of the problem.b. Requirements: Justify the functional requirements. Explain what documentation will be used to analyze the needs of the end users to ensure the new system can meet their expectations?c.

Capillaries</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Pulmonary circulation is the movement of blood from the heart to the lungs. It delivers deoxygenated blood to the lungs, where it is <strong>oxygenated </strong>and carbon dioxide is released. After then, the <strong>oxygenated</strong> blood returns to the heart. The heart and the rest of the body are connected through systemic circulation. It transports <strong>oxygenated</strong> blood to cells while also returning deoxygenated blood to the heart.</p><p>To start systemic circulation, the heart pushes <strong>oxygenated</strong> blood out of the left ventricle and into the aorta. After supplying oxygen and nutrients to cells throughout the body, blood returns deoxygenated blood to the right atrium of the heart. From the right atrium to the right ventricle, deoxygenated blood flows. To start pulmonary circulation, the heart pumps it out of the right ventricle and into the pulmonary arteries. The blood travels from the left atrium to the lungs, where it swaps carbon dioxide for oxygen before returning to the left atrium. The <strong>oxygenated</strong> blood travels from the left atrium to the left ventricle below, where it is recirculated throughout the body.</p><p>The circulatory and respiratory systems work together to provide oxygen and eliminate carbon dioxide from the body. External respiration is made easier by pulmonary circulation, which allows deoxygenated blood to move into the lungs. It takes in oxygen from small air sacs called alveoli and exhales carbon dioxide. Internal respiration is aided by systemic circulation: Through the remainder of the body, oxygenated blood goes into capillaries. The blood transports oxygen to cells while also absorbing carbon dioxide.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>How circulatory system works in pulmonary circulation brainly.ph/question/9842887</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />
