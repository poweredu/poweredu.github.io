The world literature emerged because of the development of global economic and cultural relations.This global literary process was also caused by the rapid development of national literatures. In the history of world literature, we define several stages of its development such as the literature of Bronze Age, Classical literature, Early Medieval literature, Medieval literature, Early Modern and Modern literature.World literature is the cultural heritage of all humanity. It is essential to study world literature as it helps us understand the life of different people from all over the world, forms our world-outlook and acquaints us with the masterpieces of literature.QUESTION.1.

                        1. Related literature and studies are important in research as they provide a foundation for the study, help identify gaps in knowledge, and provide support for the study's theoretical framework. These sources can also help the researcher build on and extend previous research in the field, provide insights into the research methods used, and help to contextualize the study's findings. Additionally, related literature and studies can help the researcher to identify potential challenges and limitations in their study.<br /><br />2. The three parts of related literature are: (1) theoretical literature, which provides the theoretical foundation for the study and helps to establish the research problem; (2) empirical literature, which includes previous studies and research related to the study topic; and (3) conceptual literature, which includes concepts and ideas related to the study topic from various sources, such as textbooks, journals, and other reference materials.<br /><br />3. One characteristic of related literature and studies is that they are based on established research methods and principles. These sources are typically peer-reviewed and published in reputable academic journals or books, and they undergo a rigorous review process to ensure that they meet certain quality standards. Additionally, related literature and studies are typically based on empirical evidence and are grounded in sound theoretical frameworks, which ensure that they are reliable and valid sources of information for researchers.<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1    The Problem Can Be Stated Clearly and Concisely</p><p></p><p>Unless the problem can be stated clearly and concisely it is probably a poor problem or a non-problem. The best way to test the problem statement is to write it into a concise sentence or paragraph and to share it with others. If the problem cannot be stated in a clear paragraph it has difficulties and will not endure as a suitable problem. Of course, it is not easy to express complex issues in simplistic terms and it may take many weeks and countless drafts before the statement is satisfactory. Good critics are essential. If your spouse or mother cannot understand it, it is probably flaky.</p><p></p><p>2    The Problem Generates Research Questions</p><p></p><p>The problem should generate a number of more specific research questions. These turn the problem into a question format and represent various aspects or components of the problem. The research questions make the more general statement easier to address and provide a framework for the research. Formulating these questions can be a challenge, particularly specifying them at the right level of abstraction.</p><p></p><p>3    It Is Grounded in Theory</p><p></p><p>Good problems have theoretical and/or conceptual frameworks for their analysis. They relate the specifics of what is being investigated to a more general background of theory which helps interpret the results and link it to the field.</p><p></p><p>4    It Relates to One or More Academic Fields of Study</p><p></p><p>Good problems relate to academic fields which have adherents and boundaries. They typically have journals to which adherents relate. Research problems which do not have clear links to one or two such fields of study are generally in trouble. Without such a field it becomes impossible to determine where, in the universe of knowledge, the problem lies.</p><p></p><p>5    It Has a Base in the Research Literature</p><p></p><p>Related to the former points, a well-stated problem will relate to a research literature. Tight problems often relate to a well-defined body of literature, written by a select group of researchers and published in a small number of journals. With some problems, it might at first be difficult to establish the connections and literature base, but there should be a base somewhere.</p><p></p><p>6    It Has Potential Significance/importance</p><p></p><p>This is the important ‘so what’ question: Who cares once you solve the problem? Assume that you have solved the problem and answered the questions and then ask yourself if you are any further ahead. At the very least, the problem must have importance to the researcher, but ideally it should also be of consequence to others.</p><p></p><p>7    It Is DoableWithin the Time Frame, Budget</p><p></p><p>There are logistic factors in terms of your ability actually to carry out the research. There is no point pursuing a problem which is not feasible to research. Do not do a study of education in India unless you have the means to go there and collect data ̶ which may require years to collect. This factor helps explain why few theses relate to longitudinal data. The only exceptions come from research shops where there is a long history of collecting and studying data on a defined population. Terman’s study of genius (1954) in which a defined sample was traced over 30 years, is a good example.</p><p></p><p>8    Sufficient Data Are Available or Can Be Obtained</p><p></p><p>In some cases, there are insufficient data to address the problem. Historical persons may have died, archival materials may be lost, or there may be restrictions on access to certain environments. As noted, it is difficult to conduct research on a distant country unless you can go there and collect local data. One under-used approach is to use an existing database. Some data banks have been developed over many years and contain many opportunities for exploration of new questions and issues.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Step by step guide </p><p>Hope can help you </p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            9. True or False1. A synthesis tries to determine the connection of the research's review of related literature.2. Integration of parts of the researcher's information gathered into a whole new idea is a characteristic of synthesis of RRL.3. Synthesis is a combination of different ideas to form a new whole.4. In synthesizing a collection of ideas, the researcher must identify the methodology used, participants and instruments used in the study of another researcher.5. A synthesis of a research paper is about concisely summarizing and linking different sources to get the idea of the literature review.6. Synthesizing the collection of sources gathered in the research paper is not essential in conducting research.7. Synthesis and analysis usually goes together when you are synthesizing your review of related literature.8. Synthesis determines the question,"Which sources overlap or share the same opinion/ findings?"9. A synthesis answers the question, "Have the researcher found any common traits or teams in the literature?"10.
