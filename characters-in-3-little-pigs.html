                                            "The Three Little Pigs."
At a village lived three little pigs. One day, their mother sent them out into
the world for them to become independent. The first little pig built a house from
straw. The second built a house from sticks, and the third one built a house made
of bricks.
A wolf goes to the house of the first pig and blows the house down. The pig
runs to his brother's house made of sticks, but the wolf also blows that down.
The two pigs run to the third pig's house, and the wolf huffs and puffs but
cannot destroy the house. The wolf then decides to get inside the house by going
down the chimney.
The wolf falls into a cauldron of boiling water. The wolf runs away, never
bothering the three little pigs again.

                                            Three Little PigsOnce upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and do not haveenough food to feed them. The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the threelittle pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pigs inside."Little pigs! Little pigs! Let me in! Let me in!"So, he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf tried to catch both pigsat once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air andthe three little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.The three little pigs were very frightened. They knew the wolf wanted to eat them. He hadn'teaten all day and had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around, smelling all three ofthem inside. He knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.He decided to enter the house through the chimney, but the three little pigs lit up a fire andput a huge pot with boiling water on it. The wolf fell into the pot, and they put on the cover again,boiling the wolf up. The three little pigs ate him for supper.1. Where does the story happened?2. Who are the characters in the story? 3.

                            9. the three little pig story​</h2><br />
                        <p>Once upon a time there was an old mother pig who had three little pigs and not enough food to feed them. So when they were old enough, she sent them out into the world to seek their fortunes</p><p></p><p>The first little pig was very lazy. He didn't want to work at all and he built his house out of straw. The second little pig worked a little bit harder but he was somewhat lazy too and he built his house out of sticks. Then, they sang and danced and played together the rest of the day.</p><p></p><p>The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks. It was a sturdy house complete with a fine fireplace and chimney. It looked like it could withstand the strongest winds.</p><p></p><p>The next day, a wolf happened to pass by the lane where the three little pigs lived; and he saw the straw house, and he smelled the pig inside. He thought the pig would make a mighty fine meal and his mouth began to water.</p><p></p><p>So he knocked on the door and said:</p><p></p><p><strong>Little pig! Little pig!</strong></p><p><strong>Little pig! Little pig!  Let me in! Let me in!</strong></p><p></p><p>But the little pig saw the wolf's big paws through the keyhole, so he answered back:</p><p></p><p><strong>No! No! No! </strong></p><p><strong>No! No! No!   Not by the hairs on my chinny chin chin!</strong></p><p></p><p>Then the wolf showed his teeth and said:</p><p></p><p><strong>  Then I'll huff </strong></p><p><strong>  Then I'll huff   and I'll puff </strong></p><p><strong>  Then I'll huff   and I'll puff   and I'll blow </strong><strong>your </strong><strong>house </strong><strong>down!</strong></p><p></p><p>So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf opened his jaws very wide and bit down as hard as he could, but the first little pig escaped and ran away to hide with the second little pig.</p><p></p><p>The wolf continued down the lane and he passed by the second house made of sticks; and he saw the house, and he smelled the pigs inside, and his mouth began to water as he thought about the fine dinner they would make.</p><p></p><p>So he knocked on the door and said:</p><p></p><p><strong>  Little pigs! Little pigs!</strong></p><p><strong>  Little pigs! Little pigs!  Let me in! Let me in!</strong></p><p></p><p>But the little pigs saw the wolf's pointy ears through the keyhole, so they answered back:</p><p></p><p><strong>No! No! No!</strong></p><p><strong>No! No! No!  Not by the hairs on our chinny chin chin!</strong></p><p></p><p>So the wolf showed his teeth and said:</p><p></p><p><strong>  Then I'll huff </strong></p><p><strong>  Then I'll huff   and I'll puff </strong></p><p><strong>  Then I'll huff   and I'll puff   and I'll blow your house down!</strong></p><p></p><p>So he huffed and he puffed and he blew the house down! The wolf was greedy and he tried to catch both pigs at once, but he was too greedy and got neither! His big jaws clamped down on nothing but air and the two little pigs scrambled away as fast as their little hooves would carry them.</p><p></p><p>The wolf chased them down the lane and he almost caught them. But they made it to the brick house and slammed the door closed before the wolf could catch them. The three little pigs they were very frightened, they knew the wolf wanted to eat them. And that was very, very true. The wolf hadn't eaten all day and he had worked up a large appetite chasing the pigs around and now he could smell all three of them inside and he knew that the three little pigs would make a lovely feast.</p><p></p><p>But the little pigs saw the wolf's narrow eyes through the keyhole, so they answered back:</p><p></p><p> <strong>No! No! No! </strong></p><p><strong>No! No! No!   Not by the hairs on our chinny chin </strong></p><p></p><p>So the wolf showed his teeth and said:</p><p></p><p> <strong> Then I'll huff </strong></p><p><strong> Then I'll huff   and I'll puff </strong></p><p><strong> Then I'll huff   and I'll puff   and I'll blow your house down.</strong></p><p></p><p>Well! he huffed and he puffed. He puffed and he huffed. And he huffed, huffed, and he puffed, puffed; but he could not blow the house down. At last, he was so out of breath that he couldn't huff and he couldn't puff anymore. So he stopped to rest and thought a bit.</p><p></p><p>But this was too much. The wolf danced about with rage and swore he would come down the chimney and eat up the little pig for his supper. But while he was climbing on to the roof the little pig made up a blazing fire and put on a big pot full of water to boil. Then, just as the wolf was coming down the chimney, the little piggy pulled off the lid, and plop! in fell the wolf into the scalding water.</p><p></p><p>So the little piggy put on the cover again, boiled the wolf up, and the three little pigs ate him for supper.</p><p></p><p>"THE END"</p><p></p><p>#Brainlist Bunch</p><br />

                            12. "The Three Little Pigs."
At a village lived three little pigs. One day, their mother sent them out into
the world for them to become independent. The first little pig built a house from
straw. The second built a house from sticks, and the third one built a house made
of bricks.
A wolf goes to the house of the first pig and blows the house down. The pig
runs to his brother's house made of sticks, but the wolf also blows that down.
The two pigs run to the third pig's house, and the wolf huffs and puffs but
cannot destroy the house. The wolf then decides to get inside the house by going
down the chimney.
The wolf falls into a cauldron of boiling water. The wolf runs away, never
bothering the three little pigs again.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>What is the plot of 'The Three Little Pigs'?</p><p></p><p>Two lazy pigs build shabby houses of sticks and straw because they don’t want to do hard work and prefer to relax and play all day. They make fun of their hard-working brother who puts in the time and effort to build a solid house of brick. However, when an evil wolf comes after them, he easily destroys the lazy pigs’ flimsy houses and they run for shelter to their brother’s sturdy brick house. The wolf cannot get into the brick house and all three pigs are saved by the oldest brother’s hard work and responsible attitude.</p><p></p><p>The Three Little Pigs retold by James Marshall
</p><p>Summary of the Story
</p><p>Three little pigs leave home to seek their fortunes. Two pigs build their houses of flimsy materials. The wolf blows down their houses and eats them up. The third pig builds his house out of brick, which the wolf cannot blow down. The wolf then asks the pig to get turnips, pick apples, and go to the fair. Each time the pig goes an hour earlier, tricking the wolf. At the fair, the pig sees the wolf. The pig escapes by rolling home in a butter churn. The wolf comes to the pig's house, climbs onto the roof, and jumps into a pot of boiling water.

</p><p>Give open-ended prompts on each page. For example, ask: What's happening on this page? What does the little pig do then? What does the wolf do then? Do less reading of the words to the story each time you read, leaving more and more of the "reading" or retelling to the child.
</p><p>Give prompts about objects or activities in the pictures. For example, ask: What is the mother pig doing? (She's crying because the pigs are leaving home.) Use your finger to point to what you are asking about. Evaluate the child's response. Expand it by giving more information. Ask the child to repeat the answer. If he or she needs help in answering a question, ask that question again the next time you read the book.
</p><p>You may wish to discuss the prompts shown below.
</p><p>Extra Activities
</p><p>
</p><p>Have children read The Three Little Pigs to each other.
</p><p>Children can dramatize the story as you reread it. Children taking the parts of the pigs can draw their houses on the chalkboard. Children listening can join in on the repeated phrases.
</p><p>Recall Questions
</p><p>Ask the following questions to check children's understanding of the story.
</p><p>
</p><p>What is the title of this book? (The title is The Three Little Pigs.)
</p><p>Who is this story about? (It's about three little pigs and a wolf who wants to eat them up.)
</p><p>What does the first little pig do? (He builds a house out of straw.)
</p><p>What does the wolf do to the first little pig's house? (He huffs and puffs and blows the house in.)
</p><p>What happens to the second little pig? (He builds a house out of sticks, and the wolf blows his house in, too.)
</p><p>Why can't the wolf blow down the third little pig's house? (The third little pig made his house out of bricks.)
</p><p>How does the wolf plan to catch the pig next? Does his plan work? (The wolf tries to get the pig to go to the turnip field, to the apple orchard, and to the fair. Each time the pig tricks the wolf and gets away.)
</p><p>What happens to the wolf in the end? (The wolf falls into a pot of boiling water, and the pig eats him up.)</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The <strong>Three Little Pigs</strong> is taking your time to do something right pays off. At the beginning of the story, each pig built a house. The first two pigs didn't spend much time making their houses, but the third pig carried heavy bricks and carefully stacked them into a solid house.</p><p>Kung may iba pang katanungan, ilagay lamang sa comment section.
