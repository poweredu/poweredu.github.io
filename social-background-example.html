                                            Social networking sites encourage us to be more public about our personal lives. Because intimate details of our lives can be posted so easily, we often don't use the filters we might normally employ when talking about our private life. What's more, thethings we post remain available indefinitely. While at the moment, a photo of friends doing shots at a party may seem harmless, the image may appear less attractive in the context of an employer doing a background check. While most sites allow their users to control who sees the things they posted, such limitations are often forgotten.Source: SOCIAL MEDIA - 10th grade test - English ESL Worksheets for distance learningand physical classrooms (islcollective.com).  1.

                            20. Social networking sites encourage us to be more public about our personal lives. Because intimate details of our lives can be posted so easily, we often don't use the filters we might normally employ when talking about our private life. What's more, thethings we post remain available indefinitely. While at the moment, a photo of friends doing shots at a party may seem harmless, the image may appear less attractive in the context of an employer doing a background check. While most sites allow their users to control who sees the things they posted, such limitations are often forgotten.Source: SOCIAL MEDIA - 10th grade test - English ESL Worksheets for distance learningand physical classrooms (islcollective.com).  1.
