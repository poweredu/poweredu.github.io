                    <p>Let’s Try Directions: Read the paragraph carefully. Afterward, answer the following questions. Why a can of soda explodes if left outside on a hot sunny day A can of soda explodes when left in the sot sun because the pressure of the can increases due to the increase in temperature, eventually making the can explode due to the pressure being too high. In the online simulation, the volume of the contained was kept constant to represent a can. Gas was pumped into the container until the pressure was 1.5 atm. When the temperature is increased to from 300k to 500k, the pressure to 2.9 atm increased. When the temperature increased from 500k to 900k, the pressure increased to 5.5atm from 2.9 atm. At 1050k, the container exploded and released the gas after the pressure built to over 6 atm. According to Gay- Lussac’s Law, when volume is held constant, as it was in the case of the soda can, pressure and temperature are directly proportional. This means as temperature increases, pressure increases, and when temperature decreases, pressure decreases. If a soda can left out in the hot sun, the temperature inside the can will continually increase, causing the kinetic energy to increase. This causes the particles to move faster and hit the walls more often., increasing the pressure. Over time the pressure continues to increase as the temperature increases, eventually reaching too high of a pressure causing the can to explode. Reasonable Risk-taking Part of my Philosophy is that a life worth living involves taking reasonable risks, whatever that may mean to a person. Without that openness, responsiveness, a person sees very little possibility for change and can sink into a rut of routines. I have known many who define themselves by their routines-and little else. These are the people an American educator spoke of when he said, “Many people should have written on their tombstones: “Died at 30, buried at 60.” How sad! I think that one of the most horrible feelings a person must have is to be on the deathbed, regretting the many things never tried, and many things done that cannot be undone. I live my life to minimize possibilities of regrets, as I hope you do. Did you ever see that Sandra Bullock movie 28 Days? She plays an alcoholic in a destructive relationship with a guy who wants only to have fun. A staff person at the clinic where she is sentences to spend 28 days for her rehab explained: “Insanity is repeating the same behavior over and over and expecting different results.” Maybe more people should watch that movie. The world may not go out of its way to help you-the world does not owe us fairness-but the world is there with more possibilities than most of us imagine. If we are responsible to ourselves- and response-able, we can continue growing in the directions that are good for us. We do not need to understand the future, which, after all, does not exist, has not yet been created A.

Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Staff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so hat they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are aised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius.. Baby animals attract more visitors than older animals. Killing an adult animal opens up space and esources to bring in a younger animal. That animal can draw bigger crowds and more money. That is the eal reason Marius was killed. The zoo made less money as he grew up. People were more interested in Marius when he was baby than when he became an adult. The second reason zoos should be banned is that they rarely help endangered animals return to heir original habitats. A report by National Geographic found that most zoos do not have any contact with introduction programs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a nonprofit organization that fights for nimal rights. According to them, fewer than one-fifth of the animals in United States zoos are actually ndangered. When animal species is endangered, it is at risk of dying out completely. Zoos spend tons of money building enclosures for animals. Yet, they do almost nothing to restore wild habitats or to stop oaching in wild environments. Finally, zoos simply do not have enough resources to properly house the creatures that live there. Vild habitats cannot be remade in spaces where animals are held captive. An opinion article called "All e Reasons Why Zoos Should Be Banned" was published by Vice in 2015. It said polar bears in zoos ave up to 18,000 times less space than they do in the wild. Animals cannot be healthy in zoos. Seventy-five percent of elephants kept in zoos are overweight cording to the article. Forty percent of lion cubs pass away before their full life span. This data support e argument that zoos do not have the resources to support animals' well-being, health and populations. he British Broadcasting Company (BBC) has reported that around 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed eac ar in zoos in Europe. Many more animals show signs of zoochosis. This is a psychological disorder served in zoo animals that leads to pacing, bar biting and other repeated behaviors. Zoos should make an effort to reintroduce the animals they own into natural habitats. Some coul returned to the wild. However, many zoo animals would not be able to survive in the wild. These imals should then be sent to sanctuaries where they can live peacefully. Zoos inhumanely source and breed animals. They do little to improve wildlife populations. Zoos -o do little to help the public understand their impact on wildlife. Also, they cannot provide what is eded to support animals' lives. Zoos should reintroduce their animals into the wild or into sanctuary tings. This will have the added benefit of relieving zoos of the burden of keeping these animals alive n't that a win-win?​</a>

                            1. Let’s Try Directions: Read the paragraph carefully. Afterward, answer the following questions. Why a can of soda explodes if left outside on a hot sunny day A can of soda explodes when left in the sot sun because the pressure of the can increases due to the increase in temperature, eventually making the can explode due to the pressure being too high. In the online simulation, the volume of the contained was kept constant to represent a can. Gas was pumped into the container until the pressure was 1.5 atm. When the temperature is increased to from 300k to 500k, the pressure to 2.9 atm increased. When the temperature increased from 500k to 900k, the pressure increased to 5.5atm from 2.9 atm. At 1050k, the container exploded and released the gas after the pressure built to over 6 atm. According to Gay- Lussac’s Law, when volume is held constant, as it was in the case of the soda can, pressure and temperature are directly proportional. This means as temperature increases, pressure increases, and when temperature decreases, pressure decreases. If a soda can left out in the hot sun, the temperature inside the can will continually increase, causing the kinetic energy to increase. This causes the particles to move faster and hit the walls more often., increasing the pressure. Over time the pressure continues to increase as the temperature increases, eventually reaching too high of a pressure causing the can to explode. Reasonable Risk-taking Part of my Philosophy is that a life worth living involves taking reasonable risks, whatever that may mean to a person. Without that openness, responsiveness, a person sees very little possibility for change and can sink into a rut of routines. I have known many who define themselves by their routines-and little else. These are the people an American educator spoke of when he said, “Many people should have written on their tombstones: “Died at 30, buried at 60.” How sad! I think that one of the most horrible feelings a person must have is to be on the deathbed, regretting the many things never tried, and many things done that cannot be undone. I live my life to minimize possibilities of regrets, as I hope you do. Did you ever see that Sandra Bullock movie 28 Days? She plays an alcoholic in a destructive relationship with a guy who wants only to have fun. A staff person at the clinic where she is sentences to spend 28 days for her rehab explained: “Insanity is repeating the same behavior over and over and expecting different results.” Maybe more people should watch that movie. The world may not go out of its way to help you-the world does not owe us fairness-but the world is there with more possibilities than most of us imagine. If we are responsible to ourselves- and response-able, we can continue growing in the directions that are good for us. We do not need to understand the future, which, after all, does not exist, has not yet been created A.

                            4. Read the text carefully. Evaluate the claims with the writer's logos, ethos, and pathos. Write your answers on a separate sheet of paper. Student Opinion: Zoos should be banned by Megan Zhou (Adapted by Newsela Staff) Published on July 16, 2020 Do you think zoos are nice places for animals to live? If you do, think again. Zoos are harmful to animals. There are three main reasons why. First, zoos breed animals inhumanely. Second, they do not help animals return to the wild. Third, they do not take good enough care of the animals. For these reasons, zoos should be shut down and banned, or stopped altogether. The first reason zoos should be banned is that they breed captive animals. Zoos breed animals so hat they will have baby animals to show the public. Most zoo animals are born inside zoos. Many are aised without ever seeing their original, wild homes. When zoos have too many animals, they do not return them to the wild. They simply kill the "extra" animals. Take this example from 2014. The Copenhagen Zoo is located in Denmark, a country in northern Europe. A giraffe there named Marius was raised as a baby in the zoo. He was loved by the public. Yet, when he became an adult, he was killed. The zoo's staff shot him. They didn't think he would be useful. They had other male giraffes they could breed instead of Marius.. Baby animals attract more visitors than older animals. Killing an adult animal opens up space and esources to bring in a younger animal. That animal can draw bigger crowds and more money. That is the eal reason Marius was killed. The zoo made less money as he grew up. People were more interested in Marius when he was baby than when he became an adult. The second reason zoos should be banned is that they rarely help endangered animals return to heir original habitats. A report by National Geographic found that most zoos do not have any contact with introduction programs. People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) is a nonprofit organization that fights for nimal rights. According to them, fewer than one-fifth of the animals in United States zoos are actually ndangered. When animal species is endangered, it is at risk of dying out completely. Zoos spend tons of money building enclosures for animals. Yet, they do almost nothing to restore wild habitats or to stop oaching in wild environments. Finally, zoos simply do not have enough resources to properly house the creatures that live there. Vild habitats cannot be remade in spaces where animals are held captive. An opinion article called "All e Reasons Why Zoos Should Be Banned" was published by Vice in 2015. It said polar bears in zoos ave up to 18,000 times less space than they do in the wild. Animals cannot be healthy in zoos. Seventy-five percent of elephants kept in zoos are overweight cording to the article. Forty percent of lion cubs pass away before their full life span. This data support e argument that zoos do not have the resources to support animals' well-being, health and populations. he British Broadcasting Company (BBC) has reported that around 3,000 to 5,000 animals are killed eac ar in zoos in Europe. Many more animals show signs of zoochosis. This is a psychological disorder served in zoo animals that leads to pacing, bar biting and other repeated behaviors. Zoos should make an effort to reintroduce the animals they own into natural habitats. Some coul returned to the wild. However, many zoo animals would not be able to survive in the wild. These imals should then be sent to sanctuaries where they can live peacefully. Zoos inhumanely source and breed animals. They do little to improve wildlife populations. Zoos -o do little to help the public understand their impact on wildlife. Also, they cannot provide what is eded to support animals' lives. Zoos should reintroduce their animals into the wild or into sanctuary tings. This will have the added benefit of relieving zoos of the burden of keeping these animals alive n't that a win-win?​</h2><br />
                        <p>In this text, the writer uses logos by providing factual information, such as the National Geographic report and the statistics about the space polar bears have in zoos compared to the wild. The writer also uses ethos by citing sources such as PETA and the BBC to support their argument. Finally, the writer uses pathos by evoking emotion through their description of the death of Marius the giraffe and the psychological effects of captivity on zoo animals.</p><br />
