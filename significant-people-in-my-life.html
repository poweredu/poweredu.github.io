Circle any signal words that could be used to help identify the text type and underline any other words or phrases that helped you make your decision Passages	Pattern1. There are several reasons why so many people attend the Olympic games or watch them on television. One reason is tradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remind people of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinariness of daily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like to identify with someone else’s individual sacrifice and accomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’s or a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory. There are national medal counts and people keep track of how many medals their country’s athletes have won. 	2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has become very big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hosts the games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, and playing fields must be built for the athletic events and housing is needed for the athletes who come from around the world. And all of these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 Los Angeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companies who wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies like McDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Many buildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were also used. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was used again and many colleges and universities in the area became playing and living areas. 	3. A phobia is an intense fear or feeling of anxiety that occurs only in a particular situation that frightens you. This might be something as seemingly logical as a fear of heights, or as illogical as a fear of the color green. At other times you don’t feel anxious. For example, if you have a phobia of spiders (as millions of people do), you only feel anxious when there’s a spider around, otherwise you feel fine. About one in ten people has a significant phobia, although few people seek treatment. 	4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my own tablet,” Keisha said persuasively. And Mom answered with a teasing smile on her face, “Honey, but your current situation shows the contrary.” 	​</a>

A blank piece of paper represents my world. I draw a stick figure to repre- sent myself. Around the paper, I start writing significant things in my life and I draw lines between them; my world is full of connections. The connections I have with people, my community, and the earth itself. The connections I built shape my dreams of marketing, law, and fashion, and I color my world with numerous shades. Coloring it gives me excitement. The connections I evolved with people are like lands in my world; they are dif- ferent and necessary. Every one of them affected my life in some way, but some of them shaped my dreams and aspirations more than other people. Two such people are my father and my boss at a company I work for. My father explained to me how marketing is the basis of every business. Even when we were just shopping, he would teach me marketing skills, such as branding. He helped me discover marketing as my fascination.​</a>

The connections I built shape my dreams of marketing, law, and fashion, and I color my world with numerous shades. Coloring it gives me excitement. The connections I evolved with people are like lands in my world; they are dif- ferent and necessary. Every one of them affected my life in some way, but some of them shaped my dreams and aspirations more than other people. Two such people are my father and my boss at a company I work for.

There are several reasons why so many people attend theOlympic games or watch them on television. One reason istradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remindpeople of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinarinessof daily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like toidentify with someone else’s individual sacrifice andaccomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’sor a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory.There are national medal counts and people keep track of howmany medals their country’s athletes have won.2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has becomevery big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hoststhe games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, andplaying fields must be built for the athletic events and housing isneeded for the athletes who come from around the world. And all ofthese facilities are used for only two weeks!

A phobia is an intense fear or feeling of anxiety that occurs onlyin a particular situation that frightens you. This might be somethingas seemingly logical as a fear of heights, or as illogical as a fear ofthe color green. At other times you don’t feel anxious. For example,if you have a phobia of spiders (as millions of people do), you onlyfeel anxious when there’s a spider around, otherwise you feel fine.About one in ten people has a significant phobia, although fewpeople seek treatment.4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my owntablet,” Keisha said persuasively.

A blank piece of paper represents my world. I draw a stick figure to repre- sent myself. Around the paper, I start writing significant things in my life and I draw lines between them; my world is full of connections. The connections I have with people, my community, and the earth itself. The connections I built shape my dreams of marketing, law, and fashion, and I color my world with numerous shades. Coloring it gives me excitement. The connections I evolved with people are like lands in my world; they are dif- ferent and necessary. Every one of them affected my life in some way, but some of them shaped my dreams and aspirations more than other people. Two such people are my father and my boss at a company I work for. My father explained to me how marketing is the basis of every business. Even when we were just shopping, he would teach me marketing skills, such as branding. He helped me discover marketing as my fascination.​</a>

Circle any signal words that could be used to help identify the text type and underline any other words or phrases that helped you make your decision Passages	Pattern1. There are several reasons why so many people attend the Olympic games or watch them on television. One reason is tradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remind people of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinariness of daily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like to identify with someone else’s individual sacrifice and accomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’s or a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory. There are national medal counts and people keep track of how many medals their country’s athletes have won. 	2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has become very big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hosts the games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, and playing fields must be built for the athletic events and housing is needed for the athletes who come from around the world. And all of these facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 Los Angeles solved these problems by charging a fee for companies who wanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies like McDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Many buildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were also used. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was used again and many colleges and universities in the area became playing and living areas. 	3. A phobia is an intense fear or feeling of anxiety that occurs only in a particular situation that frightens you. This might be something as seemingly logical as a fear of heights, or as illogical as a fear of the color green. At other times you don’t feel anxious. For example, if you have a phobia of spiders (as millions of people do), you only feel anxious when there’s a spider around, otherwise you feel fine. About one in ten people has a significant phobia, although few people seek treatment. 	4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my own tablet,” Keisha said persuasively.

Circle any signal words that could be used to help identify the text type andunderline any other words or phrases that helped you make your decision.1. There are several reasons why so many people attend theOlympic games or watch them on television. One reason istradition. The name Olympics and the torch and flame remindpeople of the ancient games. People can escape the ordinarinessof daily life by attending or watching the Olympics. They like toidentify with someone else’s individual sacrifice andaccomplishment. National pride is another reason, and an athlete’sor a team’s hard-earned victory becomes a nation’s victory.There are national medal counts and people keep track of howmany medals their country’s athletes have won.2. One problem with the modern Olympics is that it has becomevery big and expensive to operate. The city or country that hoststhe games often loses a lot of money. A stadium, pools, andplaying fields must be built for the athletic events and housing isneeded for the athletes who come from around the world. And all ofthese facilities are used for only two weeks! In 1984 Los Angelessolved these problems by charging a fee for companies whowanted to be official sponsors of the games. Companies likeMcDonald’s paid a lot of money to be part of the Olympics. Manybuildings that were already built in Los Angeles area were alsoused. The coliseum where the 1932 games were held was usedagain and many colleges and universities in the area became playing and living areas.3. A phobia is an intense fear or feeling of anxiety that occurs onlyin a particular situation that frightens you. This might be somethingas seemingly logical as a fear of heights, or as illogical as a fear ofthe color green. At other times you don’t feel anxious. For example,if you have a phobia of spiders (as millions of people do), you onlyfeel anxious when there’s a spider around, otherwise you feel fine.About one in ten people has a significant phobia, although fewpeople seek treatment.4. “Mom, I believe that it is very necessary for me to have my owntablet,” Keisha said persuasively. And Mom answered with ateasing smile on her face, “Honey, but your current situation showsthe contrary.”​</h2><br />
