                                            FOUR VALUES IN FILIPINO DRAMA AND FILMNicanor G. Tiongson(1) THERE IS NO doubt that cinema has risen as one of the most popular means ofmass communication in contemporary Philippines. Movie theaters dot cities, townsand other important commercial centers from Aparri to Jolo. Through thesetheaters, Nora Aunor has truly become a national figure and tagalog has risen tothe status of a real national language. Indeed, movie theaters have become asimportant to us today as churches were in the last century.(2) Because movies have become one of the most important means ofcommunication, it is high time that the Filipinos examined the values encounteredin and propagated by, the movies. These values at the general worldview arisingfrom them inevitably mold the Filipino's consciousness for better or for worse, in aneffective, if insidious, manner through stories that entertain.(3) Sad to say, the principal values encountered in most Filipino movies today arethe same negative values they have inherited from the traditional dramas whichmigrated, so to speak, from stage to screen, and provided the latter, for the longesttime, with both form, content and most of all, world-view. Four of these valueswhich we must single out for their prevalence, perseverance and perniciousnessmay ne encapsulated in the following statements: 1) Maganda ang Maputi (White isbeautiful), 2) Masaya ang may Palabas (Shows are the best), 3) Mabuti ang Inaapi(Hurrah for the Underdog!), and 4) Maganda pa ang Daigdig (All is Right with theworld)Comprehension Guide Questions: 3 points each1.

There are many examples of secular music that became part of the cultural identities of the Philippines, especially in the place where it originated. However, these songs were influenced by Spanish music style because of the Spanish those music which resulted to its new style and unique cultural value. Let us take a look on harana and colonization in the Philippines. Since artistry is innate among Filipinos, we created our own version of balitaw. Spanish Tango or Habanera. Harana is a Filipino tradition of serenading a woman which derives its rhythmic style from the Harana Balitaw sung in triple meter. This secular music originated in the Visayas region, although some tagalog version Balitaw is an extemporaneous exchange of verses between a man and a woman and usually of balitaw music can also be found in some parts of the central and southern tagalog regions. A woman may express her message in the final stanzas of the song if she willfully accepts a man's suit or proposal for her. Both performers dance while singing. Tagalog versions of balitaw sometimes describe nature, places, or things figuratively but the inner message will also lead in love and courtship, pictures? In this activity, you will also use the same.

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Baybayin (Tagalog pronunciation: [baɪbaˈjɪn], pre-kudlit: ᜊᜊᜌᜒ, virama-krus-kudlit: ᜊᜌ᜔ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜔, virama-pamudpod: ᜊᜌ᜴ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜴; also incorrectly known as alibata) is a Philippine script. The script is an alphasyllabary belonging to the family of the Brahmic scripts. It was widely used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines prior to and during the 16th and 17th centuries before being supplanted by the Latin alphabet during the period of Spanish colonization. It was used in Tagalog and to a lesser extent Kapampangan speaking areas; its use spread to Ilokanos in the early 17th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries, baybayin survived and evolved into multiple forms—the Tagbanwa script of Palawan, and the Hanuno'o and Buhid scripts of Mindoro—and was used to create the constructed modern Kulitan script of the Kapampangan and the Ibalnan script of the Palawan tribe.[citation needed]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            18. FOUR VALUES IN FILIPINO DRAMA AND FILMNicanor G. Tiongson(1) THERE IS NO doubt that cinema has risen as one of the most popular means ofmass communication in contemporary Philippines. Movie theaters dot cities, townsand other important commercial centers from Aparri to Jolo. Through thesetheaters, Nora Aunor has truly become a national figure and tagalog has risen tothe status of a real national language. Indeed, movie theaters have become asimportant to us today as churches were in the last century.(2) Because movies have become one of the most important means ofcommunication, it is high time that the Filipinos examined the values encounteredin and propagated by, the movies. These values at the general worldview arisingfrom them inevitably mold the Filipino's consciousness for better or for worse, in aneffective, if insidious, manner through stories that entertain.(3) Sad to say, the principal values encountered in most Filipino movies today arethe same negative values they have inherited from the traditional dramas whichmigrated, so to speak, from stage to screen, and provided the latter, for the longesttime, with both form, content and most of all, world-view. Four of these valueswhich we must single out for their prevalence, perseverance and perniciousnessmay ne encapsulated in the following statements: 1) Maganda ang Maputi (White isbeautiful), 2) Masaya ang may Palabas (Shows are the best), 3) Mabuti ang Inaapi(Hurrah for the Underdog!), and 4) Maganda pa ang Daigdig (All is Right with theworld)Comprehension Guide Questions: 3 points each1.

                        <p><strong>Answer: Filipino values are social constructs within Filipino culture that define that which is socially considered to be desirable. The Filipino value system describes "the commonly shared and traditionally established system of values underlying Filipino behavior" within the context of the more extensive Filipino cultural system.[1] These relate to the unique assemblage of consistent ideologies, moral codes, ethical practices, etiquette, and personal and cultural values promoted by Filipino society.[citation needed]</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The formal study of Filipino values has been made difficult by the historical context of the literature in the field. The early scholarship about the Filipino value system lacked clear definitions and organizational frameworks and was mostly written by foreigners during the Philippines' American colonial period.[1][2] The latter half of the 20th century saw efforts to develop clearer definitions and properly contextualized frameworks, but many aspects of the scholarship require further clarification and consensus.[1][2]</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The different value system of Filipinos has generally been described as rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based on kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity), and commercial relationships.[3]</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            22. ilar Music Passion for Harana and Balitaw Secular Music: Harana and Balitaw Music that is non-religious in nature is called secular music. There are many examples of secular music that became part of the cultural identities of the Philippines, especially in the place where it originated. However, these songs were influenced by Spanish music style because of the Spanish those music which resulted to its new style and unique cultural value. Let us take a look on harana and colonization in the Philippines. Since artistry is innate among Filipinos, we created our own version of balitaw. Spanish Tango or Habanera. Harana is a Filipino tradition of serenading a woman which derives its rhythmic style from the Harana Balitaw sung in triple meter. This secular music originated in the Visayas region, although some tagalog version Balitaw is an extemporaneous exchange of verses between a man and a woman and usually of balitaw music can also be found in some parts of the central and southern tagalog regions. A woman may express her message in the final stanzas of the song if she willfully accepts a man's suit or proposal for her. Both performers dance while singing. Tagalog versions of balitaw sometimes describe nature, places, or things figuratively but the inner message will also lead in love and courtship, pictures? In this activity, you will also use the same. But this time, you will distinguish the similarities and Do you still remember the Venn Diagram that you have accomplished after analyzing the 2 differences between Harana and Balitaw by applying your understanding of its musical elements.

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

 Zildjian Benitez (vocals); Tim Marquez (guitarist);
 Diana Mapa (percussions)

Answer the following questions:
1. What message does the lyricist, Levi Celerio, convey in his song?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>ctto:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>the famous filipino folk song "ang pipit" has a sad story. if we will try to interpet the lyrics literally, it talks about a bird who was hit by a stone. the poor creature was unable to fly because of the pain and the severity of the injury so it fell from the tree. but before it hit the ground, it expresses its worry that another bird will be sad by the former's demise and that the man was too cruel for taking an innocent living being's life.
