                                            Text C (10 pts) Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, January 20)-COVID-19 response deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said Wednesday the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management Emerging Infectious Diseases would assess by end of January whether the current age restrictions can be eased. Dizon was reacting to a report on the proposal of the Trade Department to allow 10-year-old children to go out of their homes to help stimulate economic activity. Current IATF rules permit those aged 15 to 65 years old to stay outdoors. Meanwhile, those covered by the age restrictions could only leave their houses to access essential items and services. The official said the decision will mainly depend on whether the holidays and Black Nazarene festivities triggered a surge in the number of COVID - 19 cases. The Department of Health earlier said it expects to know about the possible impact of holiday gatherings and the Black Nazarene feast celebration this month. "Tingin ko po (I think) by end of Jan. or Feb., it will be reevaluated and we will see if we can ease some more depending on what happens to our cases," Dizon told the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum. Devotees were earlier allowed to attend mass celebrations in Quiapo Church for the Feast of the Black Nazarene on Jan. 9. Masses were held in lieu of the Traslacion or grand procession of the Black Nazarene image, which traditionally draws millions of Catholic faithful. Experts have warned of a spike in coronavirus cases which might lead to stricter movement restrictions after up to 400,000 devotees visited the Quiapo area on the eve and on the day of the Black Nazarene feast. Dizon said they will also consider their experts' advice on this matter, noting that most of the IATF advisers are medical professionals. "I think when our medical advisers come to a point where they are comfortable na (that) it will not cause a tremendous risk to the general population, then restrictions on age will be slowly eased as well," he said.

                                            Rizal was not a handsome man. In physique, he was neither dashing nor imposing, for he was a shy small man – a few inches above five feet in height. But he possessed an aura of charisma due to his many-splendored talents and noble character, which made him attractive to romantic young women. No wonder the prettier of Don Pablo’s daughters (Consuelo) fell in love with him.Rizal being a lonely man in a foreign country, far from his natal land, was attracted by Consuelo’s beauty and vivacity. He even composed a lonely poem on August 22, 1883 dedicated to her. In this poem titled A La Senorita C. O. y P. (To Miss C. O. y P.) he expressed his admiration for her. He found solace and joy in her company.However, before his romance with Consuelo could blossom into a serious affair, he suddenly backed out for two reason: (1) he was still engaged to Leonor Rivera and (2)   his friend and co-worker in the Propaganda Movement, Eduardo de Lete, was madly in love with Consuelo and he had no wish to break their friendship because of a pretty girl.FINANCIAL WORRIESAfter Rizal's departure for Spain, things turned from bad to worse in Calamba.On top of this economic disaster, the manager of Dominican-owned hacienda increased the rentals of the lands cultivated by Rizal family. This hacienda manager, a frequent guest at the Rizal's home, used to ask for a turkey from Don Francisco (the hero's father) who was a good raiser of turkey.Due to hard times in Calamba, the monthly allowances of Rizal in Madrid were late in arrival and there were times when they never arrived, causing much suffering to him.Paciano sell his younger brother's pony in order to send money to Madrid.A touching incident in Rizal's Life in Madrid occured on June 12, 1884.With an empty stomach he attended his class at the university, participated in the contest in Greek language and won the gold medal. he was a great speaker in a banquet held in honor of Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgi at Restaurant Ingles, Madridexplain every paragraph, badly need, ty​</a>

                                            In 2008 two Zimbabweans, Mr. and Mrs. Shumba, returned from the bankcarrying a bag full of money, $5 trillion in total. They had failed to buy maize-meal, sugar or cooking oil for the family as the foodstuffs were not available on the market. As Mr. Shumba sat down and pondered what to do for his family, he remembered how his grandfather used to sustain his large family with honey from the African wild bees. Mr. Shumba then made a decision to set up a bee-hive. He was helped by Mr. Hove to make a hive using locally available resources. Mr. Hove also asked for a bottle of honey, in return for his services and not money. After a while a swarm of bees had settled in the hive and before long, Mr. Shumba managed to harvest the honey for his family. He relied on the harvesting skills which his grandfather had taught him. He used some herbs which he burnt to make the bees drowsy during harvesting. In addition to the honey, the community also noticed that an edible berry shrub which had not produced fruit for a long time was now full of berries and more bird species could now be seen in the area. At the beginning of the next rainy season, two other varieties of berries and other small fruits returned. Children could be seen chasing a variety of colorful butterflies which they had not seen before. The community also noticed that many children no longer suffered from frequent bouts of colds and coughs as in the past. As the demand for honey increased Mr. Shumba set up two more hives and started selling the surplus. He could now pay school fees for his children. One day he went to the city to seek market opportunities. The following morning his wife phoned him to say that all the bee-hives had been burnt as someone from the community had tried to harvest honey illegally. Mr. Shumba was devastated by the loss and boarded the next bus to return home. As he sat in the bus on his long journey back home, he made up his mind that he was going to re-start the beekeeping project and started planning the new strategies he was going to use to ensure the future sustainability of the project.1.

Each year, more than 1.3 million people visits its 71-acre site, which is home to more than 500 animals and 3,000 plant species. Although the zoo is a non-profit organization and is partially subsidized by Hamilton County, more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget is generated through its own fundraising efforts. Cincinnati Zoo takes pride in the fact that it has the lowest public subsidy of any zoo in Ohio and generates more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget through its own fundraising efforts. In challenging economic conditions, the Zoo wanted to reduce its reliance on subsidies even further by increasing visitor attendance and revenues from secondary sources such as membership, food and retail outlets. This would secure the Zoo’s future and enable it to continue its pioneering work in conservation, preservation and research. Currently, Cincinnati Zoo makes use of four separate legacy point-of sale systems with a single platform to provide data on all admission, membership, retails and food service sales. To monitor the number of visitors in certain areas, the zoo staff members make their rounds to observe. You have been hired by Cincinnati Zoo to provide them a solution that will enable them achieve their business objectives:        Increase attendance and revenues by enhancing the customer experience for each visitor        Boost sales for food and retail outlets through more effective marketing and promotions        Optimize labor costs by gaining a better understanding of demand patterns throughout the year        Maximize the workforce by identifying areas of the park that are in need of more staff.   Questions:          What are the problems with the current system of the Cincinnati Zoo?          What are the data available to the zoo management and staff?          How can these data be used to help the following perform their work better to achieve the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo?          Zoo administrators          Zoo staff          What solutions can be provided for the following stakeholders so that the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo are achieved? Explain in detail the proposed solution for each stakeholder. In each solution, identify which type of analytics will be applied (descriptive, predictive or prescriptive)        Zoo visitors        Zoo management        Zoo staff services​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>TECHNOLOGY<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Technology</strong> is the amount of any procedures, abilities, strategies, and cycles utilized in the development of labor and products or in the achievement of destinations, like logical examination. <strong>Technology</strong> can be the information on procedures, processes, and such, or it very well may be implanted in machines to take into consideration activity without definite information on their functions. Frameworks applying <strong>technology</strong> by taking an info, transforming it as per the framework's utilization, and afterward creating a result are alluded to as <strong>technology</strong> frameworks or innovative frameworks.
</p><p>
</p><p>The least complex type of <strong>technology </strong>is the turn of events and utilization of essential apparatuses. The ancient creation of molded stone apparatuses followed by the disclosure of how to control fire expanded wellsprings of food. The later Neolithic Upset broadened this, and quadrupled the food accessible from a domain.

                            17. Text C (10 pts) Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, January 20)-COVID-19 response deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said Wednesday the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management Emerging Infectious Diseases would assess by end of January whether the current age restrictions can be eased. Dizon was reacting to a report on the proposal of the Trade Department to allow 10-year-old children to go out of their homes to help stimulate economic activity. Current IATF rules permit those aged 15 to 65 years old to stay outdoors. Meanwhile, those covered by the age restrictions could only leave their houses to access essential items and services. The official said the decision will mainly depend on whether the holidays and Black Nazarene festivities triggered a surge in the number of COVID - 19 cases. The Department of Health earlier said it expects to know about the possible impact of holiday gatherings and the Black Nazarene feast celebration this month. "Tingin ko po (I think) by end of Jan. or Feb., it will be reevaluated and we will see if we can ease some more depending on what happens to our cases," Dizon told the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum. Devotees were earlier allowed to attend mass celebrations in Quiapo Church for the Feast of the Black Nazarene on Jan. 9. Masses were held in lieu of the Traslacion or grand procession of the Black Nazarene image, which traditionally draws millions of Catholic faithful. Experts have warned of a spike in coronavirus cases which might lead to stricter movement restrictions after up to 400,000 devotees visited the Quiapo area on the eve and on the day of the Black Nazarene feast. Dizon said they will also consider their experts' advice on this matter, noting that most of the IATF advisers are medical professionals. "I think when our medical advisers come to a point where they are comfortable na (that) it will not cause a tremendous risk to the general population, then restrictions on age will be slowly eased as well," he said.

                            20. Rizal was not a handsome man. In physique, he was neither dashing nor imposing, for he was a shy small man – a few inches above five feet in height. But he possessed an aura of charisma due to his many-splendored talents and noble character, which made him attractive to romantic young women. No wonder the prettier of Don Pablo’s daughters (Consuelo) fell in love with him.Rizal being a lonely man in a foreign country, far from his natal land, was attracted by Consuelo’s beauty and vivacity. He even composed a lonely poem on August 22, 1883 dedicated to her. In this poem titled A La Senorita C. O. y P. (To Miss C. O. y P.) he expressed his admiration for her. He found solace and joy in her company.However, before his romance with Consuelo could blossom into a serious affair, he suddenly backed out for two reason: (1) he was still engaged to Leonor Rivera and (2)   his friend and co-worker in the Propaganda Movement, Eduardo de Lete, was madly in love with Consuelo and he had no wish to break their friendship because of a pretty girl.FINANCIAL WORRIESAfter Rizal's departure for Spain, things turned from bad to worse in Calamba.On top of this economic disaster, the manager of Dominican-owned hacienda increased the rentals of the lands cultivated by Rizal family. This hacienda manager, a frequent guest at the Rizal's home, used to ask for a turkey from Don Francisco (the hero's father) who was a good raiser of turkey.Due to hard times in Calamba, the monthly allowances of Rizal in Madrid were late in arrival and there were times when they never arrived, causing much suffering to him.Paciano sell his younger brother's pony in order to send money to Madrid.A touching incident in Rizal's Life in Madrid occured on June 12, 1884.With an empty stomach he attended his class at the university, participated in the contest in Greek language and won the gold medal. he was a great speaker in a banquet held in honor of Juan Luna and Felix Resurreccion Hidalgi at Restaurant Ingles, Madridexplain every paragraph, badly need, ty​</h2><br />

                            28. In 2008 two Zimbabweans, Mr. and Mrs. Shumba, returned from the bankcarrying a bag full of money, $5 trillion in total. They had failed to buy maize-meal, sugar or cooking oil for the family as the foodstuffs were not available on the market. As Mr. Shumba sat down and pondered what to do for his family, he remembered how his grandfather used to sustain his large family with honey from the African wild bees. Mr. Shumba then made a decision to set up a bee-hive. He was helped by Mr. Hove to make a hive using locally available resources. Mr. Hove also asked for a bottle of honey, in return for his services and not money. After a while a swarm of bees had settled in the hive and before long, Mr. Shumba managed to harvest the honey for his family. He relied on the harvesting skills which his grandfather had taught him. He used some herbs which he burnt to make the bees drowsy during harvesting. In addition to the honey, the community also noticed that an edible berry shrub which had not produced fruit for a long time was now full of berries and more bird species could now be seen in the area. At the beginning of the next rainy season, two other varieties of berries and other small fruits returned. Children could be seen chasing a variety of colorful butterflies which they had not seen before. The community also noticed that many children no longer suffered from frequent bouts of colds and coughs as in the past. As the demand for honey increased Mr. Shumba set up two more hives and started selling the surplus. He could now pay school fees for his children. One day he went to the city to seek market opportunities. The following morning his wife phoned him to say that all the bee-hives had been burnt as someone from the community had tried to harvest honey illegally. Mr. Shumba was devastated by the loss and boarded the next bus to return home. As he sat in the bus on his long journey back home, he made up his mind that he was going to re-start the beekeeping project and started planning the new strategies he was going to use to ensure the future sustainability of the project.1.

                            29. Case Analysis - Module 3 Instructions Instructions Case Analysis: The Cincinnati Zoo and Botanical Garden is one of the most popular attractions and a Top Zoo for Children Zoo for Children according to Parent’s Magazine. Each year, more than 1.3 million people visits its 71-acre site, which is home to more than 500 animals and 3,000 plant species. Although the zoo is a non-profit organization and is partially subsidized by Hamilton County, more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget is generated through its own fundraising efforts. Cincinnati Zoo takes pride in the fact that it has the lowest public subsidy of any zoo in Ohio and generates more than two-thirds of its $26 million annual budget through its own fundraising efforts. In challenging economic conditions, the Zoo wanted to reduce its reliance on subsidies even further by increasing visitor attendance and revenues from secondary sources such as membership, food and retail outlets. This would secure the Zoo’s future and enable it to continue its pioneering work in conservation, preservation and research. Currently, Cincinnati Zoo makes use of four separate legacy point-of sale systems with a single platform to provide data on all admission, membership, retails and food service sales. To monitor the number of visitors in certain areas, the zoo staff members make their rounds to observe. You have been hired by Cincinnati Zoo to provide them a solution that will enable them achieve their business objectives:        Increase attendance and revenues by enhancing the customer experience for each visitor        Boost sales for food and retail outlets through more effective marketing and promotions        Optimize labor costs by gaining a better understanding of demand patterns throughout the year        Maximize the workforce by identifying areas of the park that are in need of more staff.   Questions:          What are the problems with the current system of the Cincinnati Zoo?          What are the data available to the zoo management and staff?          How can these data be used to help the following perform their work better to achieve the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo?          Zoo administrators          Zoo staff          What solutions can be provided for the following stakeholders so that the business objectives of Cincinnati Zoo are achieved? Explain in detail the proposed solution for each stakeholder. In each solution, identify which type of analytics will be applied (descriptive, predictive or prescriptive)        Zoo visitors        Zoo management        Zoo staff services​</h2><br />
