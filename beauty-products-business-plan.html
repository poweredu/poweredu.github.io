For items 6-7, read the following paragraph and answer the following questions: Residents of the Central Park area look with alarm at the diabolical plot to change a beautiful spot into a baseball park. If this malicious plan is carried out, the lovely trees in the park will be chopped down. Values of the property within the area will drop sharply as the park fills with the filth and debris of the bulldozers and other equipment. Later the shrieks of the young ruffians who take over the park will destroy the peace and quiet of the neighborhood. Obviously, no one cares about the poor resident who has slaved to pay for his home and to keep up with his taxes. 6. In this passage, the author shows bias against A. homeowners and taxpayers B. residents of the Central Park area C. a baseball field in the park D. more trees in the park New cars are not built as well as they used to be.

Invariably, new cars need parts replaced almost as soon as the warranty expires. Unfortunately, people need transportation, so they continue to buy new automobiles.​</a>
