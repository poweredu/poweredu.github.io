                            14. ECQ At Works The Enhanced Community Quarantine or ECQ is one of the many occurrences of the COVID-19 crisis. It is the strictest of all forms of quarantine used in the Philippines It has introduced us to a new mode of living where staying at home becomes essential to save lives. It has also limited our opportunities to work and socialize. Others even lose their jobs as industries have eventually closed. There came the SAP (Social Amelioration Program) or better known as "ayuda" from the National Government.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Revival of GMRC a must these days</p><p>Lately, a favorite topic in public discussions is the proposal to revive the teaching of good manners and right conduct (GMRC) as a full school subject and for it to be added to the curriculum of the K-12 program.</p><p>For the youngsters who most likely do not know, the GMRC is a school subject that teaches kids about the importance of having basic morals, values, qualities and ethics.</p><p></p><p>In the past -- and this includes my generation -- the GMRC was taught in schools and students are not only graded for it. There is also a certain award or medal that is given for anyone who excels in the subject and shows perfect application via behaviour in school.</p><p></p><p>Recently, we only hear of the term ‘GMRC’ in admonitions or criticisms about one’s upbringing. When someone shows ill behaviour and is chided for it, we usually hear the words, ‘maybe he was absent when GMRC was being taught in school.’</p><p></p><p>In my opinion, bringing back GMRC as part of every student’s learning process in this day and age is necessary and long overdue.</p><p></p><p>I’m sure many would share my observation on wide-ranging occasions where one could only sigh at the lack of GMRC on the part of today’s youth.</p><p></p><p>In public transportation units and other public places including Churches, you will see millennials — boys at that— sitting comfortably and pretending to be either asleep or checking on their cellphones while a pregnant woman, a mother with a baby, a handicapped or an elderly stands right in front of him or her during the entire trip or event.</p><p></p><p>These days too, you see milennials taking pictures of their food before eating instead of saying grace. The words ‘po’ and ‘opo’, the blessing of the hands of the elderly and saying ‘please’, ‘excuse me’ and ‘thank you’ have become like gems. They are that rare already when during the olden days, they were basic good manners.</p><p></p><p>The level of discipline and respectful behavior among children and teens of today is unquestionably at an all-time low.</p><p></p><p>Notice that even in restaurants, you see a table with family members who do not even talk, since they are all preoccupied with their gadgets. Youngsters these days no longer respect food and what we call as ‘hapag-kainan’ and treat eating as a sideline while they are on their cellphones.</p><p></p><p>I read somewhere that most of the generation of today are on the internet for as long as ten hours a day.</p><p></p><p>Given this situation, I hope that the GMRC, should it be really revived, be taught with the kind of approach that would make it compatible to the prevailing lifestyle which revolves around technology.</p><p></p><p>There is no doubt though, that there is a current urgent need to institutionalize the GMRC as a subject in both elementary and high schools and yes, maybe even all the way up to college.</p><p></p><p>Senator Joel Villanueva, who filed Senate Bill 860 or the proposed Comprehensive Values Education Act, mentioned in a hearing: ‘We can’t discount the fact that Values Education or Edukasyon sa Pagpapakatao (ESP) is already included in the Department of Education curriculum, yet there is a clamor for the revival of GMRC in the curriculum, and this clamor is indeed proper, given realities that we observe in our manner of conducting affairs in various aspects of our daily lives as Filipinos.’</p><p></p><p>The problem with ESP is that it is reportedly being taught in public schools for only 30 minutes. This is certainly not enough.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Read more on Brainly.ph - https://brainly.ph/question/9355186#readmore</p><br />

                        <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly affected education globally, including special education. In the Philippines, where special education is still a developing field, the pandemic has highlighted the need for further improvements in the sector. Despite some positive developments, the state of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is still inadequate.</p><p></p><p>One positive development in the Philippines is the increased awareness and attention given to special education during the pandemic. The government has launched various initiatives, including the provision of assistive technology and online training for teachers to support students with special needs. Additionally, the Department of Education (DepEd) has released guidelines for distance learning for students with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>However, these initiatives fall short in addressing the needs of all students with special needs in the country. For instance, the provision of assistive technology has been limited and not enough to support all students with disabilities. Additionally, online training for teachers is not enough to equip them with the necessary skills and knowledge to support students with different learning needs.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exposed the already existing challenges in special education in the Philippines. According to a report by Human Rights Watch, the government has failed to ensure that all children with disabilities have access to education. Many students with disabilities face barriers to enrollment, such as lack of transportation, inaccessible classrooms, and insufficient support services. The pandemic has only made these challenges more evident, with many students with disabilities unable to access distance learning materials and services.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while some progress has been made in the field of special education in the Philippines during the pandemic, the state of special education is still inadequate. The government must do more to address the barriers to education faced by students with disabilities, including the provision of more assistive technology and support services, and the improvement of teacher training. Only then can students with special needs receive the education they deserve, even during these challenging times.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>According to the Department of Education (DepEd) in the Philippines, there are currently over 2 million learners with disabilities enrolled in public and private schools across the country. These learners are entitled to special education services to help them succeed in their academic pursuits. However, with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the delivery of special education services has been severely impacted, leading to a decline in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities.</p><p></p><p>One of the challenges facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic is the lack of access to technology and the internet. With the implementation of distance learning, learners with disabilities who do not have access to the necessary technology and internet connection are at a disadvantage. This has resulted in a significant reduction in the number of learners with disabilities who are able to participate in online classes.</p><p></p><p>Another issue is the lack of training and resources for teachers who are tasked with providing special education services. Many teachers are not equipped with the skills and knowledge necessary to provide effective online special education services. This has resulted in the quality of education received by learners with disabilities being compromised.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the pandemic has exacerbated the existing inequalities in the education system. Learners with disabilities from low-income families are particularly vulnerable, as they may not have access to the same resources and support as their peers from more affluent backgrounds. This further widens the gap in the quality of education between different groups of learners.</p><p></p><p>In light of these challenges, it is imperative that the government takes action to address the issues facing special education in the Philippines during the pandemic. This includes providing learners with disabilities with the necessary technology and internet connection, as well as providing teachers with the training and resources they need to effectively deliver special education services online. Additionally, more support should be given to learners from low-income families to ensure that they are not left behind.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the pandemic has brought to light the challenges facing special education in the Philippines. It is crucial that the government takes action to address these challenges and ensure that learners with disabilities are not left behind. By providing the necessary support and resources, we can ensure that all learners have access to quality education, regardless of their circumstances.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Study hard,hope it help</p><br />

Rizal’s influence is eminent among the social realist writers. Spanish influences can still be observed in terms of cultures and languages used in literature by some prominent writers such as Nick Joaquin. Our experiences during colonial period which stretches up to the present truly reflected in the most notable Filipino works in the field of literature.

                        <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Published in 1946, Ginto Sa Makiling – a novel by Macario Pineda, is the first work of note that appeared after the second world war. In plot, it hews close to the mode of romantic fantasy traceable to the awits, koridos and komedyas of the Balagtas tradition. But it is a symbolical narrative of social, moral and political import. In this, it resembles not only Balagtas but also Rizal, but in style and plot it is closer to Balagtas in not allowing the realistic mode to restrict the element of fantasy.</p><p></p><p>       Two novels by writers in English dealt with the war experience: (Medina, p. 194) Stevan Javellana’s Without Seeing the Dawn (1947), and Edilberto Tiempo’s Watch in the Night. Both novels hew closely to the realist tradition. Lazaro Francisco, the eminent Tagalog novelist of the pre-war years, was to continue to produce significant work. He revised his Bayaning Nagpatiwakal (1932), refashioning its plot and in sum honing his work as a weapon against the policies that tended to perpetuate American economic dominance over the Philippines. The updated novel was titled Ilaw Sa Hilaga (1948) (Lumbera, p. 67). He was to produce three more novels.Sugat Sa Alaala (1950) reflects the horrors of the war experience as well as the human capacity for nobility, endurance and love under the most extreme circumstances. Maganda Pa Ang Daigdig (1956) deals with the agrarian issue, and Daluyong (1962) deals with the corruption bred by the American-style and American-educated pseudo-reformers. Lazaro Francisco is a realist with social and moral ideals. The Rizal influence on his work is profound.</p><p></p><p>       The poet Amado Hernandez, who was also union leader and social activist, also wrote novels advocating social change. Luha ng Buwaya (1963) (Lumbera) deals with the struggle between the oppressed peasantry and the class of politically powerful landlords. Mga Ibong Mandaragit (1969) deals with the domination of Filipinos by American industry (Lumbera, p. 69).</p><p></p><p>       Unfortunately, the Rizalian path taken by Lazaro Francisco and Amado Hernandez with its social-realist world-view had the effect of alienating them from the mode of the highly magical oral-epic tradition. Imported social realism (and, in the case of Amado Hernandez, a brand of socialist empiricism), was not entirely in touch with the folk sentiment and folk belief, which is why the Tagalog romances (e.g., Ginto Sa Makiling, serialized in the comics), were far more popular than their work.</p><p></p><p>       </p><br />
