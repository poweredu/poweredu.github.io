                                            THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

There are questions that serve as your guide in making your reflection. Write your reflection in a clean sheet of paper. Good luck! World Youth Day 2019 An Excerpted Pope Francis' Address At the Opening of World Youth Day "You teach us that encountering one another does not mean having to look alike or think the same way or do the same things, listening to the same music or wearing the same football jersey. No, not at all... The culture of encounter is a call inviting us to dare to keep alive a shared dream. Yes, a great dream, a dream that has a place for everyone. The dream for which Jesus gave his life on the cross, for which the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost and brought fire to the heart of every man and woman, in your hearts and mine, in the hope of finding room to grow and flourish.A dream named Jesus, sown by the Father in the confidence that it would grow and live in every heart. A dream running through our veins, thrilling our hearts and making them dance whenever we hear the command: "that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another".My Relection1. What is the message of Pope Francis to you?2. How should you express the underlined message "that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another". of God in the text in your family, community and country?​</a>

At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't even think twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, I was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, Just so I could be with you. All I ever did was care for you. All I ever did was to make you happy. And all I ever did was love you. Being in love means never having to say you’re sorry But I needed to ask forgiveness from the one who was hurt the most… Myself 1. what is the imagery of the poem? 2. what is the mood of the poem?​</a>

                                            Undivided Heart in Loving Service to Others
The clean of heart refers to those who have an undivided attention to the loving service
of God and others. These people completely give what they can, all for the service of God
and others. This does not mean being half-hearted, even if it would mean the sacrifice of
something or someone dear to one's heart, while trusting in God. Take the story of Abraham
and his unfailing obedience to God found in Genesis 22:1-18. This sets an example of what it
is to be clean of heart. In the story, Abraham was instructed by God to offer the life of his only
son, Isaac, as a burnt offering for the Lord (Genesis 2:1-2).
To offer his only son was a very difficult task for Abraham. Isaac was not only his only
beloved son, but the son he had waited for so long. But Abraham trusted God more than he
trusted his own human reason. Without any doubt and resistance, he obeyed God. Abraham's
pure heart saw everything with the eyes of faith. This means that he had no other desire
than to do what God commanded him to do. He relied on God and His promise. A clean heart
is one that is not half-hearted, but one constantly devoted to God. One does not rely on
personal perception and understanding in doing what is right. Purity of heart is not pure blind obedience to god, though

My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well.

                                            what does it mean to love god?First, loving God requires knowing Him, and that knowledge begins with His Word. It may sound glib, but to know Him is to love Him.To love God is to worship and praise Him. "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only'" (Luke 4:8). The book of Psalms provides many beautiful examples of how to worship and praise our Creator (e.g., Psalms 8, 19, 23, 24, 67, 99, 117, and 150).To love God is to put Him first. The number-one commandment is to love God “with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength” (Mark 12:30). It’s an undivided love. God is our priority. If we love God with all our hearts, souls, minds, and strength, then we won’t allow other things to crowd in. Our love for God is manifested by loving people (Mark 12:31), but we do not love the things of the world. “Earth has nothing I desire besides you” (Psalm 73:25). We cannot love this present world and God at the same time (1 John 2:15); love for what the world offers can lead us astray (2 Timothy 4:10).share kolng ​</a>

                            9. THE MARTYR 
By Nick Joaquin 
Being in love means never having to say you're sorry after all, at some point in your life that love was the most important thing to you, that love might be the one that you hoped would last forever, that love made you believe that destiny does exist, and that love made you question, why you were afraid to fall in love in the first place. At that time in your life, Everything just seemed so perfect, Everything seemed so beautiful, Everything seemed to glow for you, And you were my everything. I wouldn't twice about sacrificing my own happiness for yours, i was even willing to bare up this walled but crumpled heart of mine, just so i could be With you. All i ever did was care for you.
All i ever did was to make you happy.
All i ever did was love you.

World Youth Day 2019 An Excerpted Pope Francis' Address At the Opening of World Youth Day "You teach us that encountering one another does not mean having to look alike or think the same way or do the same things, listening to the same music or wearing the same football jersey. No, not at all... The culture of encounter is a call inviting us to dare to keep alive a shared dream. Yes, a great dream, a dream that has a place for everyone. The dream for which Jesus gave his life on the cross, for which the Holy Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost and brought fire to the heart of every man and woman, in your hearts and mine, in the hope of finding room to grow and flourish.A dream named Jesus, sown by the Father in the confidence that it would grow and live in every heart. A dream running through our veins, thrilling our hearts and making them dance whenever we hear the command: "that you love one another; even as I have loved you, that you also love one another".My Relection1.

                            18. Undivided Heart in Loving Service to Others
The clean of heart refers to those who have an undivided attention to the loving service
of God and others. These people completely give what they can, all for the service of God
and others. This does not mean being half-hearted, even if it would mean the sacrifice of
something or someone dear to one's heart, while trusting in God. Take the story of Abraham
and his unfailing obedience to God found in Genesis 22:1-18. This sets an example of what it
is to be clean of heart. In the story, Abraham was instructed by God to offer the life of his only
son, Isaac, as a burnt offering for the Lord (Genesis 2:1-2).
To offer his only son was a very difficult task for Abraham. Isaac was not only his only
beloved son, but the son he had waited for so long. But Abraham trusted God more than he
trusted his own human reason. Without any doubt and resistance, he obeyed God. Abraham's
pure heart saw everything with the eyes of faith. This means that he had no other desire
than to do what God commanded him to do. He relied on God and His promise. A clean heart
is one that is not half-hearted, but one constantly devoted to God. One does not rely on
personal perception and understanding in doing what is right. Purity of heart is not pure blind obedience to god, though

                        <p><strong>: Answer ꒱꒱ ̣ ̟</strong></p><strong></strong><strong>1. What do you think is the meaning of the statement of Nelson Mandela?</strong><strong></strong>Mandella was a famous politician and activist during his time, devoting his time fighting for equal rights. This statement was meant to call out the racism that was happening in South Africa. In this statement, he pointed out that loving "comes more naturally to the human heart than its opposite", meaning that hating requires more effort than the former.<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>2. What is your opinion on his statement?</strong><strong></strong>l agree with his statement because really, the way someone looks or thinks should not affect the way you treat them. I like how Nelson Mandela chose not to deliberately shame those who hate another person because of the color of his skin or his background or his religion. Instead, he provided his own insights, saying that anyone who does hate, can definitely learn how to love. He chose to educate.<strong></strong><strong>3. Do you think his statement is acceptable? Why or why not?</strong><strong></strong>Personally, I do think Mandela's statement is acceptable; there is obviously nothing wrong with wanting to change an unfair world.<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong>4. Is it biased or not? Why or why not?</strong><p><strong></strong></p>I do not think his statement was biased. Yes, he was affected by the discrimination he was fighting against, but that only fueled his drive to keep going. It didn't cloud his judgment, and he didn't go berserk; he handled the situation with the truth that his words held.<strong></strong><strong></strong><strong></strong><p>—————————— /ᐠ｡ꞈ｡ᐟ\ ——————————</p><p><strong>       Click the links below to read more!</strong></p><p>Nelson Mandella - (Filipino) https://brainly.ph/question/478249, (English) https://brainly.ph/question/3700452</p><p><strong></strong></p><p>Join the fight for equality!

                            26. what does it mean to love god?First, loving God requires knowing Him, and that knowledge begins with His Word. It may sound glib, but to know Him is to love Him.To love God is to worship and praise Him. "It is written: 'Worship the Lord your God and serve him only'" (Luke 4:8). The book of Psalms provides many beautiful examples of how to worship and praise our Creator (e.g., Psalms 8, 19, 23, 24, 67, 99, 117, and 150).To love God is to put Him first. The number-one commandment is to love God “with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength” (Mark 12:30). It’s an undivided love. God is our priority. If we love God with all our hearts, souls, minds, and strength, then we won’t allow other things to crowd in. Our love for God is manifested by loving people (Mark 12:31), but we do not love the things of the world. “Earth has nothing I desire besides you” (Psalm 73:25).
