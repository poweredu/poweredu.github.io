He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Esmerelda comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Sister Gudule, screams at La Esmerelda for being a "gypsy child- thief" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Esmerelda is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Phoebus calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Frollo watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Phoebus. His obsessive lust for La Esmerelda has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Esmerelda like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night, he follows Phoebus to his tryst with La Esmerelda and stabs Phoebus repeatedly. He escapes and La Esmerelda is captured by the King's guard. After being tortured at her trial, La Esmerelda falsely confesses to killingPhoebus and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Grève. Frollo visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a "goblin-monk" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Esmerelda is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Phoebus and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Esmerelda and enters the house of his brideto-be. Just then, Quasimodo swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out "Sanctuary!" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along. La Esmerelda is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside thecathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Quasimodo, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Esmerelda after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she will be removed from Notre Dame. But when Quasimodo sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Esmerelda and he fend them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Frollo has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Esmerelda out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Sister Gudule. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Gudule tries to protect La Esmerelda, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Quasimodo goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Esmerelda in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Frollo by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Quasimodo sighs with grief and then throws Frollo down to his death. Looking at La Esmerelda hanging off in the distance and Frollo's wrangled corpse down below, Quasimodo cries out: "There is everything I ever loved!" Quasimodo is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Esmerelda's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her. (https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/summary/Guide Questions:1.

                                             According to legend, there was a time
when the gods could live like ordinary
mortals do. Although these gods were
enchanted, they could speak, love, and
even go to the market like what people
do in our time. This story tells what
happened to the daughter of two such
deities. This is the story of Mariang
Makiling.
Two deities, Dayang Makiling and Gat Panahon, had an only
daughter named Maria. Because of her beauty and charm, she was
the delight of her parents. The source of their joy and strength,
Maria was, to them, a jewel, a treasure that made life full of light
and laughter. At that time people could talk with the deities face to
face, and even sit with them side by side underneath a tree. People
could also ask for help when they were in need, provided that they
asked in a solemn manner. It was the custom of Maria to go to a
small market, sometimes called talipapa, on weekdays. Just like
other women, she would on such occasions wear clothes made of
silk and embroidered with flowers and wide stripes for this was the
fashion at that time. Maria had long, black abundant hair which she
usually decorated with pomelo flowers. When she went to the
market, her flowing hair would touch her ankles. As she passed
along, gallant men would bow their heads to signify their respect.
When Maria went to the market, she was always
accompanied by two Aetas, who served as her
servants. These two servants stayed close behind
Maria, and they both carried a basket each that
was full of golden ginger. These golden ginger
Maria would barter for such items needed for the
home. There was no money at that time, and
instead of buying, people bartered and exchanged
their goods for the things that they needed. On a
market day, the residents of the area are not the
only ones who would go to the talipapa.
Merchants and people from neighboring towns
would also go to the market.
One day, Gat Dula, the ruler of the kingdom
of Bay, came to the talipapa to while away
the hours. A piece of animal skin with fine
hair caught Gat Dula's eye and he reached
out to touch the fur. At the same moment,
Maria was also reaching towards the same
piece of animal skin and their shoulders
accidentally touched. Their eyes met and
Gat Dula bowed his head as a sign of
respect and apology. And Maria responded
with a shy smile as they parted from each
other's company. Since that first encounter,
Gat Dula often visited the talipapa but he
was not able to see Maria during these visits.
One day, he saw Maria at the very place
where they first met. He approached Maria
and greeted her and Maria responded with
a very sweet smile. That was the beginning
of their friendship which blossomed into
love as the months passed. As time
passed, the love affair between Gat Dula
and Maria came to be known to Gat
Panahon, Maria's father. Gat Panahon was
angry. Even Dayang Makiling, Maria's
mother, was distressed that her only
daughter was in love with a mortal.
Maria was then forbidden to go down to earth. Her
parents even took away from Maria the power of
enchantment which enabled a deity to look and act like
an ordinary mortal. But even though Maria and Gat Dula
could no longer meet physically, their love endured.
Maria continued to watch over Gat Dula. During a battle
with the army of Lakan Bunto, the ruler of a neighboring
kingdom who invaded the kingdom of Bay, Gat Dula did
not suffer a single wound due to the support of Maria's
enchantment. Unfortunately, Gat Dula's inability to see
Maria caused him to fall ill and die. Maria asked the
gods to give her the soul of Gat Dula and her request was granted

He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Esmerelda comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Sister Gudule, screams at La Esmerelda for being a "gypsy child- thief" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Esmerelda is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Phoebus calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Frollo watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Phoebus. His obsessive lust for La Esmerelda has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Esmerelda like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night, he follows Phoebus to his tryst with La Esmerelda and stabs Phoebus repeatedly. He escapes and La Esmerelda is captured by the King's guard. After being tortured at her trial, La Esmerelda falsely confesses to killingPhoebus and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Grève. Frollo visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a "goblin-monk" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Esmerelda is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Phoebus and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Esmerelda and enters the house of his brideto-be. Just then, Quasimodo swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out "Sanctuary!" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along. La Esmerelda is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside thecathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Quasimodo, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Esmerelda after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she will be removed from Notre Dame. But when Quasimodo sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Esmerelda and he fend them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Frollo has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Esmerelda out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Sister Gudule. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Gudule tries to protect La Esmerelda, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Quasimodo goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Esmerelda in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Frollo by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Quasimodo sighs with grief and then throws Frollo down to his death. Looking at La Esmerelda hanging off in the distance and Frollo's wrangled corpse down below, Quasimodo cries out: "There is everything I ever loved!" Quasimodo is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Esmerelda's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her. (https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/summary/Guide Questions:1.

                            7.  According to legend, there was a time
when the gods could live like ordinary
mortals do. Although these gods were
enchanted, they could speak, love, and
even go to the market like what people
do in our time. This story tells what
happened to the daughter of two such
deities. This is the story of Mariang
Makiling.
Two deities, Dayang Makiling and Gat Panahon, had an only
daughter named Maria. Because of her beauty and charm, she was
the delight of her parents. The source of their joy and strength,
Maria was, to them, a jewel, a treasure that made life full of light
and laughter. At that time people could talk with the deities face to
face, and even sit with them side by side underneath a tree. People
could also ask for help when they were in need, provided that they
asked in a solemn manner. It was the custom of Maria to go to a
small market, sometimes called talipapa, on weekdays. Just like
other women, she would on such occasions wear clothes made of
silk and embroidered with flowers and wide stripes for this was the
fashion at that time. Maria had long, black abundant hair which she
usually decorated with pomelo flowers. When she went to the
market, her flowing hair would touch her ankles. As she passed
along, gallant men would bow their heads to signify their respect.
When Maria went to the market, she was always
accompanied by two Aetas, who served as her
servants. These two servants stayed close behind
Maria, and they both carried a basket each that
was full of golden ginger. These golden ginger
Maria would barter for such items needed for the
home. There was no money at that time, and
instead of buying, people bartered and exchanged
their goods for the things that they needed. On a
market day, the residents of the area are not the
only ones who would go to the talipapa.
Merchants and people from neighboring towns
would also go to the market.
One day, Gat Dula, the ruler of the kingdom
of Bay, came to the talipapa to while away
the hours. A piece of animal skin with fine
hair caught Gat Dula's eye and he reached
out to touch the fur. At the same moment,
Maria was also reaching towards the same
piece of animal skin and their shoulders
accidentally touched. Their eyes met and
Gat Dula bowed his head as a sign of
respect and apology. And Maria responded
with a shy smile as they parted from each
other's company. Since that first encounter,
Gat Dula often visited the talipapa but he
was not able to see Maria during these visits.
One day, he saw Maria at the very place
where they first met. He approached Maria
and greeted her and Maria responded with
a very sweet smile. That was the beginning
of their friendship which blossomed into
love as the months passed. As time
passed, the love affair between Gat Dula
and Maria came to be known to Gat
Panahon, Maria's father. Gat Panahon was
angry. Even Dayang Makiling, Maria's
mother, was distressed that her only
daughter was in love with a mortal.
Maria was then forbidden to go down to earth. Her
parents even took away from Maria the power of
enchantment which enabled a deity to look and act like
an ordinary mortal. But even though Maria and Gat Dula
could no longer meet physically, their love endured.
Maria continued to watch over Gat Dula. During a battle
with the army of Lakan Bunto, the ruler of a neighboring
kingdom who invaded the kingdom of Bay, Gat Dula did
not suffer a single wound due to the support of Maria's
enchantment. Unfortunately, Gat Dula's inability to see
Maria caused him to fall ill and die. Maria asked the
gods to give her the soul of Gat Dula and her request was granted
