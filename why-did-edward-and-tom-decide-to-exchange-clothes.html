                                            STORYThe Prince and the PauperMark TwainOnce upon a time, a son was born to a king and queen. He was called Edward,and everyone in the palace rejoiced and blessed the infant prince. That same day.another little boy was born to a very poor family. His name was Tom. His family was so poor that they rarely had enough money to buy food. Prince Edward had plenty offood and beautiful clothing. The king doted his only son and raised him in comfort andlove.Tom grew up in poverty and hunger and had to beg strangers for a bite to eat.His father was cruel and mean. Tom was upset one day and left home and wanderedthe streets aimlessly until he found himself before a magnificent palace. The guardsstopped him from entering the palace.Just then, Prince Edward was returning from a stroll when he heard the guard'sangry shouts. But being a good prince, he commanded the guards to let him enter thepalace. The prince gave Tom many good things to eat. The two boys exchangedclothes and they were amazed to see how much alike they looked.Dressed as a pauper, the Prince walked out of the palace as he wanted to seethe outside world. The guard frowned at him angrily. The guard threw the Prince outof the castle. Meanwhile, Tom's father, who had been searching for him through thestreets, saw the prince and rushed towards him. He ill-treated the prince like he alwaysdid. And in the palace, Tom was little better off. However much he tried to tell that hewas not Prince Edward, no one would listen. Even the servants didn't believe him.Tom had no choice but to continue his masquerade.The prince was beaten by Tom's father every day. The prince was afraid of himand no longer tried to argue. As he made his way through the village, the princethought about the things he had experienced. He wanted to punish Tom's father butno one at the palace would recognize Edward as the true prince. Edward continued togo from door to door, but no one in the village wanted to give him any food. Edwardkept wandering the village, but he couldn't even manage to get one meal a day.Several days went by like this.One day, Edward came upon a knight from a neighboring country whom he hadmeet before. Once, they had participated in an archery competition together. Grabbinghis chance, Edward reminded him of the details of their last meeting and tried toconvince him of his true identity. The knight agreed and promised to help him. Heseated the prince on his horse and they rode to the palace together. While all this washappening, the King died and everyone at the palace was focused on Tom'scoronation At that moment, Prince Edward burst into the throne room. Tom was confusedHe knew what his duty was, but he was afraid to go back to his former life as a pauperFinally, he made a decision and raised his voice above the din. He speaks the truthTom declared, "I am not Prince Edward, he is!" Tom had always been an honest anddecent boy. And so, Prince Edward was crowned king.

                            10. STORYThe Prince and the PauperMark TwainOnce upon a time, a son was born to a king and queen. He was called Edward,and everyone in the palace rejoiced and blessed the infant prince. That same day.another little boy was born to a very poor family. His name was Tom. His family was so poor that they rarely had enough money to buy food. Prince Edward had plenty offood and beautiful clothing. The king doted his only son and raised him in comfort andlove.Tom grew up in poverty and hunger and had to beg strangers for a bite to eat.His father was cruel and mean. Tom was upset one day and left home and wanderedthe streets aimlessly until he found himself before a magnificent palace. The guardsstopped him from entering the palace.Just then, Prince Edward was returning from a stroll when he heard the guard'sangry shouts. But being a good prince, he commanded the guards to let him enter thepalace. The prince gave Tom many good things to eat. The two boys exchangedclothes and they were amazed to see how much alike they looked.Dressed as a pauper, the Prince walked out of the palace as he wanted to seethe outside world. The guard frowned at him angrily. The guard threw the Prince outof the castle. Meanwhile, Tom's father, who had been searching for him through thestreets, saw the prince and rushed towards him. He ill-treated the prince like he alwaysdid. And in the palace, Tom was little better off. However much he tried to tell that hewas not Prince Edward, no one would listen. Even the servants didn't believe him.Tom had no choice but to continue his masquerade.The prince was beaten by Tom's father every day. The prince was afraid of himand no longer tried to argue. As he made his way through the village, the princethought about the things he had experienced. He wanted to punish Tom's father butno one at the palace would recognize Edward as the true prince. Edward continued togo from door to door, but no one in the village wanted to give him any food. Edwardkept wandering the village, but he couldn't even manage to get one meal a day.Several days went by like this.One day, Edward came upon a knight from a neighboring country whom he hadmeet before. Once, they had participated in an archery competition together. Grabbinghis chance, Edward reminded him of the details of their last meeting and tried toconvince him of his true identity. The knight agreed and promised to help him. Heseated the prince on his horse and they rode to the palace together. While all this washappening, the King died and everyone at the palace was focused on Tom'scoronation At that moment, Prince Edward burst into the throne room. Tom was confusedHe knew what his duty was, but he was afraid to go back to his former life as a pauperFinally, he made a decision and raised his voice above the din. He speaks the truthTom declared, "I am not Prince Edward, he is!" Tom had always been an honest anddecent boy. And so, Prince Edward was crowned king. He was deeply impressed withTom's honesty and loyalty. Tom became King Edward's favorite and he gave him thetitle as The King's WardPA HELP PO PLEASE PASAHAN NA PO KASI NAMIN MAMAYA​</h2><br />

                            14. Why did tom need to check the ideas of the woman</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The theme that most stuck out to me in Uncle Tom’s Cabin was the role of women in the story. In previous texts, we have talked about the “damsel in distress” narrative where women have little impact on the story. In this novel, however, the women are empowered, painted as the “good guys”, and make a real impact on the freedom of slaves. In both the cases of Mrs. Shelby and Mrs. Bird, the women are the more humane than their male counterparts. Mrs. Shelby first aids Eliza escape with her child by delaying the departure of Haley’s search team, inviting Haley to dine for lunch by the time his horses are ready.  Aunt Chloe then proceeds to take considerable time preparing the meal, delaying Haley even more.</p><p>Senator Bird has voted to pass The Fugitive Slave Law of 1850, forbidding anyone from aiding runaway slaves and requiring them to be turned in. Again, the female counterpart is portrayed as the humane one, in this case Mrs. Bird, condemning Mr. Bird for his vote, saying “You ought to be ashamed, John! Poor, homeless, houseless creatures! It’s a shameful, wicked, abominable law, and I’ll break it, for one thing, the first time I get a chance; and hope I shall have a chance, I do!” (68) Mrs. Bird reprimands her husband, which eventually leads to Senator Bird assisting Eliza and her son to a safehouse for the night.</p><p>In both cases, the women play a role in the escape of Eliza and her child, against the initial intentions of their husbands. Both Mr. Shelby and Mr. Bird are playing the hand that they are dealt, to a certain respect, simply following the law and utilizing the system of how society is set up. However, the female characters are morally superior, and play into the larger theme of female virtue that is prominent throughout the novel. Although they still lack the power of men, each female character still makes an impact within the family, through the husband.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Summarize the statement to get the best answer.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>A wise old man, Tian, comes to the city to find out how generous and kind the people are—he exchanges clothes with a beggar and begins to beg. A generous innkeeper welcomes him every day at his door and never asks for any payment. Tian rewards him in a very special way and asks for one simple request in return.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>#carryonlearning</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>"The Prince and the Pauper" is a novel written by Mark Twain that tells the story of two boys who look alike but come from very different backgrounds. Tom Canty is a poor boy who dreams of a better life, while Prince Edward is the son of King Henry VIII, who lives a life of luxury.</p><p></p><p>1.In the beginning of the story, we learn that Tom Canty is a poor boy who lives with his family in a dirty and crowded house. He is mistreated by his father and dreams of a better life.</p><p></p><p>2.Tom was able to enter the palace by chance encounter with Prince Edward. They both bear striking resemblance to each other, and Tom took advantage of that to get inside the palace.</p><p></p><p>3.Edward and Tom decided to exchange clothes so that Edward could experience life outside the palace, and Tom could experience life as a prince.</p><p></p><p>4.The prince went out of the gate to experience life outside the palace, but he got lost and was unable to return. He was then mistaken for Tom Canty and was forced to live the life of a poor boy.</p><p></p><p>5.</p><p>a) The prince treated Tom with kindness and respect, despite his poor appearance. b) His conversation with Tom showed his curiosity and desire to learn about life outside the palace. c) The way he dealt with the cruel soldier showed his bravery and willingness to stand up for what is right.</p><p></p><p>6.It is not realistic for a rich boy to want to switch roles with a poor boy, but the story is a work of fiction that highlights the stark contrast between the lives of the rich and poor during the time of King Henry VIII.</p><p></p><p>7.It is a matter of personal preference, but the story shows that both the prince and the pauper have their own struggles and challenges in life.</p><p></p><p>8.The important lesson learned from the story is that appearances can be deceiving, and people should not be judged solely based on their social status or appearance. The story also emphasizes the importance of empathy, kindness, and understanding towards others.</p><p></p><br />

She finds him in the closet, discovers that his hands are covered with jam, and prepares to give him a whipping. Tom cries out theatrically, “Look behind you!” and when Aunt Polly turns, Tom escapes over the fence. After Tom is gone, Aunt Polly reflects ruefully on Tom’s mischief and how she lets him get away with too much.</p><p></p><p>Tom comes home at suppertime to help Aunt Polly’s young slave, Jim, chop wood. Tom also wants to tell Jim about his adventures. During supper, Aunt Polly asks Tom leading questions in an attempt to confirm her suspicion that he skipped school that afternoon and went swimming instead. Tom explains his wet hair by saying that he pumped water on his head and shows her that his collar is still sewn from the morning, which means that he couldn’t have taken his shirt off to swim. Aunt Polly is satisfied, but Sid, Tom’s half-brother, points out that the shirt thread, which was white in the morning, is now black. Tom has resewn the shirt himself to disguise his delinquency.</p><br />
