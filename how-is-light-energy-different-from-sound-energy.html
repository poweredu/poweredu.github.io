                            16. For mechanical waves such as sound waves or ocean waves, increasing the intensity of the wave increases both the amplitude (height) of the wave and the energy it carries. In that situation a low frequency but high intensity wave should have the same effect as a high frequency but low intensity wave. How does light behave differently from this model?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:Electromagnetic radiation is one of the many ways that energy travels through space. The heat from a burning fire, the light from the sun, the X-rays used by your doctor, as well as the energy used to cook food in a microwave are all forms of electromagnetic radiation. While these forms of energy might seem quite different from one another, they are related in that they all exhibit wavelike properties.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>If you’ve ever gone swimming in the ocean, you are already familiar with waves. Waves are simply disturbances in a particular physical medium or a field, resulting in a vibration or oscillation. The swell of a wave in the ocean, and the subsequent dip that follows, is simply a vibration or oscillation of the water at the ocean’s surface. Electromagnetic waves are similar, but they are also distinct in that they actually consist of 222 waves oscillating perpendicular to one another. One of the waves is an oscillating magnetic field; the other is an oscillating electric field. This can be visualized as follows:</p><p></p><br />
