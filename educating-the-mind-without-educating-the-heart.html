                                            B. Read and analyze the poem below and answer the guide questions below. In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.

                            6. B. Read and analyze the poem below and answer the guide questions below. In Community Poem by Sailing to windward In community lies strength of numbers, to support the sick and the weak. In community somebody hears me, with louder voices to speak In community lies public purpose, to shield from the harshness of life. To offer and receive common friendship, to protect from the gun and the knife In community we teach each other about science and art and sport. From this we gain our vitality, and through this our sickness is fought. In community others surround us. Their dreams, their love and their faces, encourage our hearts to prosper; our minds to accept other places. In community disaster may come But, grief shared and faith in our all, makes death's pall linger less strongly, our tears with others can fall. In community lies man's ambition. Without, makes larger our fears. Together we make sense of being and bring joy and length to our years. Source: https://www.poemhunter.com/poem/in-community/ Guide Questions: 1.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Agree. uh yes, because I believe that educating the heart is important to live a nice and happy life.

                            9. Do you agree with this quotation? “Educating the mind without educating the heart is no education at all.” Explain briefly.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, I Agree</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
I agree, because <strong>education</strong> is not just literally mean how smart or intelligent you are, that you are knowledgeable about things because we are all privileged enough to have our <strong>education</strong>. <strong>Education</strong> also means being a human, being a human means having a heart on it, just like caring for others, good attitude or possessing nice attitude, respectful, being humane, etc. things may go on a different side if we just educate only our mind, it leads to being selfish and arrogant, and it shows no education manner. But being educated through mind and heart can help us to become a great person and high possibilities of getting a success or being successful because if we are educating our minds and hearts, we become humane.</p><p>

He lived in hatredand full of anger. He neglects his emotions and did not reflect on it.Question: Does the situation merits that educating the heart is no education at all?Why? Why Not?Page 3 of 7​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The situation is very similar to the qoute. Even if we accept what happened in the past, but never tell forgive the person who did something to us, we aren't totally accepting what happened in the past. We must learn to forgive as well as educate ourselves from what happened and move on so we can learn something new.  </p><p>Answer:</p><p>Yes. </p><p>Explanation:</p><p>It is hard for the mind to function at its finest when the heart is in doubt. Jose's past experiences are meant to teach him how to become a better person yet he neglects his feelings and he wants to be oblivious about things. If I were Jose, I will first accept what has happened and leave it in the past but learn from it as well. Then, I can teach my heart to forgive and be aware that people are subject to making mistakes. Educating the heart is the start of wisdom, therefore, without teaching it first, how can a person say that he is a valuable person in humanity?</p><br />
