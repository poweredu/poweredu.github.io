                            2. Reflective essay about social work​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>         ●Working with others and improving own learning and performance are highly essential skills in social work. In this essay I will reflect on how well I have developed these two skills and what I need to do to improve them. </p><p></p><p>Before starting the degree course in university, I already had the skill working with others. As I have worked with others who were on the same course as me in the sixth form and also I did voluntary work placement which required people working together.</p><p></p><p>Before starting the university my working with others was sometimes effective and sometimes not very effective depending on the people I worked with, on the topic or area we had to work on. In sixth form I got on well with everybody in my class and working with them was not difficult. For example once me and two other students had to make a PowerPoint presentation on smoking. We worked together in planning what information will be included in the PowerPoint and who will write about what, what other materials we will need such as leaflets and who will get them. So before creating the PowerPoint presentation we planned everything together. Once the PowerPoint was created we then decided the number of slides each of us will read and talk about. So here I worked with others effectively and our PowerPoint presentation was successful.</p><p></p><p>However there have been times where I did not work effectively with others especially on my voluntary work placement. I did voluntary work in a nursery. I enjoyed working with the children there but I did not get on very well with the staff. The staff there did not interact with me as much and most of them usually gave orders to me e.g. to get something. When it came to working with the staff e.g. when getting the snack ready for the middle of paper alance my time. For example working for two hours and then spend one hour with friends.  This would enable me to get my work done or meet my targets and fullfil other demands.</p><p>In conclusion I believe that I have developed both skills working with others and improving your own learning and performance. But I need to work on these skills so I can use them in a more effective way; and I also recognise that I will not develop these in a short period of time. I will have to work on the strategies I have mentioned throughout the assignment in order to improve these skills.</p><p>It may take a long time to make progress in these skills but what I need to remember and implement is the strategies that I have mentioned. Also in this process I will be able to find out whether these strategies work on me or not and if there are other strategies that can help in improving my skills.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sorry masyadong mahaba cut nyo lang kung san kayo comfortable and please mark me if it's helpful  :)</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong>Social scientists study all aspects of society—from past events and achievements to human behavior and relationships among groups. ... They also examine the customs, values, and social patterns of different cultures, often through comparative analyses.</p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong>The social sciences do have a contribution to make to social practice, but not so large a contribution as they will make if helped to develop properly. How does the study of social sciences help solve social problems? How do social scientists carry out social research? What is the Contribution of social science in the society?</p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong>How can we make sense of our lives in this age of radical transformation? By using the resources of sociology and anthropology, the last social sciences to have evolved during the period of early modernity, we may frame a perspective to help us make sense of a shifting reality. But their insights have to be modified, given the radical changes that have taken place in the last century, in particular the rise of new technologies of communication. We not only live with media but in and through media. Technologically-mediated relationships now govern everyday life and the two disciplines are useful for defetishising many aspects of social life. Information overload is a feature of our times—transnational alliances, diasporic communities, and personal networks are replacing many of the features earlier associated with territorial entities. These give rise to transdisciplinary approaches which compete in an increasingly overcrowded intellectual world. It is time to reassess our theoretical foundations and better adjust them to prevailing realities.</p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning #ThankYouForThePoints❤<p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. How are</strong><strong> women's lives portrayed in the work?</strong></p><p>In "Dead Stars," women's lives are portrayed primarily in domestic roles and as objects of men's affections. The story depicts women as taking care of children and managing household tasks, while men are depicted in more professional roles.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Is the</strong><strong> form and content of the work influenced by the writer's gender?</strong></p><p>This is not specified in the critique but one can approach it as that as a woman writer Paz Marquez Benitez could have chosen to represent the women characters differently.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. How do</strong><strong> male and female characters relate to one another? Are these relationships sources of conflict? Are these conflicts resolved?</strong></p><p>In "Dead Stars," the male characters often relate to the female characters in a patriarchal and possessive manner. The central relationship in the story, between Alfredo and Julia, is a source of conflict and ultimately unresolved. Alfredo's continuing affection for Julia creates distance in his marriage and prevents him from fully committing to his wife.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Does the</strong><strong> work challenge or affirm traditional views of women?</strong></p><p>The critique suggests that "Dead Stars" reinforces traditional views of women as being relegated to domestic roles and as objects of men's affections.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. How do the</strong><strong> images of women in the story reflect patriarchal social forces that have impeded women's efforts to achieve full equality with men?</strong></p><p>The images of women in the story, who are primarily depicted in domestic roles and as objects of men's affections, reflect patriarchal social forces that have limited women's opportunities and autonomy.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. What</strong><strong> marital expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have?</strong></p><p>The characters are expected to conform to traditional gender roles within their marriage, with men as the head of the household and women as subservient. These expectations create distance and dissatisfaction in the marriage between Alfredo and Esperanza.</p><p></p><p><strong>7. What</strong><strong> behavioral expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have?</strong></p><p>Characters are expected to conform to traditional gender norms in terms of their behavior and emotions. Alfredo's emotions and behavior are constrained by societal expectations that men should not show vulnerability or be emotionally attached to women other than their wives.</p><p></p><p><strong>8. If a female</strong><strong> character were male, how would the story be different (and vice versa)?</strong></p><p>If Julia were a male character, the story would likely focus on a different kind of power imbalance, as a man in a relationship with a woman would not be constrained by the same societal expectations. It's possible that the story would have a different outcome as well, with the relationship between Julia and Esperanza being more of a rivalry.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>3. How do male and female characters relate to one another? Are these relationships sources of conflict? Are these conflicts resolved?</strong></p><p>In many ways, male and female characters are quite similar to one another. They both experience the same emotions and often have the same goals. However, their relationships can be sources of conflict. This is because men and women often have different ways of approaching problems and different ways of communicating. These differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. However, these conflicts can often be resolved through effective communication and by understanding the other person's perspective.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>9. How does the marital status of a character affect her er decisions or happiness?</strong></p><p>A character’s marital status can be a significant factor in their happiness. Whether a character is married or not can affect their decisions, their contentment, and their overall satisfaction with life.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>10. How does culture view women vs. men?</strong></p><p>Culture has a major impact on how women and men are viewed. In many cultures, women are seen as inferior to men. They are not given the same opportunities and are often not treated with the same respect. This can be a major problem for women who want to succeed in life. In some cultures, women are not even allowed to work or own property. They are seen as property of their husbands or fathers and are not given the same rights as men. This can make it very difficult for women to get ahead in life. In other cultures, women are seen as equals to men. They are given the same opportunities and are treated with the same respect. This can help women to succeed in life and be more respected in society.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>12. What are the power relationships between men and women (or characters assuming male/female roles)?</strong></p><p>In many societies, men have more power than women. This is because men are often seen as being more physically strong and capable than women. They are also often seen as being more logical and rational, which can give them an advantage in decision-making.</p><p>The power relationships between men and women can also vary depending on the specific situation. For example, in some workplaces, women may have more power than men. In other situations, such as in the home, men may have more power than women.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>13. Do characters take on traits from opposite genders? How so? How does this change others' reactions to them?</strong></p><p>It's generally accepted that people do tend to adopt some qualities from the opposite gender, whether it's due to nature or nurture. For example, a man might be more emotional and sensitive than average, while a woman might be more assertive and analytical.</p><p>These traits don't necessarily make someone feel like they're in the wrong body, but they can cause confusion and conflict in relationships. For instance, a man who cries easily might be seen as weak by his male friends, while a woman who's very assertive might be viewed as bossy by her female friends. In some cases, people might be drawn to others who have qualities they lack, which can lead to a more balanced and fulfilling relationship.</p><br />
