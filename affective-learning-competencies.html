                                            The world is currently facing a pandemic caused by the Corona Virus, otherwiseknown as COVID-19. One of the most affected courtry in the Southeast Asia is thePhilippines. Due to this, the government imposed strict quarantine rules to contain thevirus and lessen the number of affected individuals Physical distancing wasemphasized and “new normal" was adapted.As a result, the Department of Education decided that there would be no face-to-face instruction until there is a vaccine for the said virus. It suggested differentlearning modal ties that would help teachers deliver their lessons effectively. Thesemodalities are; a) online, where learning delivery model takes place with the use of ICTtools and the equipment of internet, b) offline, which uses digital program that containsteaching learning, and research materials in the classroom instruction without internetconnectivity and advanced facilities, @) modular, where students learn specificcompetencies at his own pace and in his own learning environment through the use ofquality modules, and, d) blended, which combines online and offline learning modalityus ng ICT tools, internet, digitized, modules, etc. Schools all over the country shoulduse these modalities to ensure the students' safety.1.As a student, what is your reaction about the DepEd's learn ng modalities?paki sagot po nang tama kailngan ko LNG po bukas (hinde ako nagbibiro)pag nasagot mo I followe kita at bigyan nga points 30​</a>

Organic compounds have relatively low melting points and boiling points.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>2.<strong>Chemical compounds may be classified according to several different criteria. One common method is based on the specific elements present. For example, oxides contain one or more oxygen atoms, hydrides contain one or more hydrogen atoms, and halides contain one or more halogen (Group 17) atoms. Organic compounds are characterized as those compounds with a backbone of carbon atoms, and all the remaining compounds are classified as inorganic.

One of the most affected courtry in the Southeast Asia is thePhilippines. Due to this, the government imposed strict quarantine rules to contain thevirus and lessen the number of affected individuals Physical distancing wasemphasized and “new normal" was adapted.As a result, the Department of Education decided that there would be no face-to-face instruction until there is a vaccine for the said virus. It suggested differentlearning modal ties that would help teachers deliver their lessons effectively. Thesemodalities are; a) online, where learning delivery model takes place with the use of ICTtools and the equipment of internet, b) offline, which uses digital program that containsteaching learning, and research materials in the classroom instruction without internetconnectivity and advanced facilities, @) modular, where students learn specificcompetencies at his own pace and in his own learning environment through the use ofquality modules, and, d) blended, which combines online and offline learning modalityus ng ICT tools, internet, digitized, modules, etc. Schools all over the country shoulduse these modalities to ensure the students' safety.1.As a student, what is your reaction about the DepEd's learn ng modalities?paki sagot po nang tama kailngan ko LNG po bukas (hinde ako nagbibiro)pag nasagot mo I followe kita at bigyan nga points 30​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Energy is transferred between trophic levels when one organism eats another and gets the energy-rich molecules from its prey's body. However, these transfers are inefficient, and this inefficiency limits the length of food chains.</p><p></p><p>2. biogeochemical cycle are found everywhere around us.</p><p></p><p>Many biogeochemical cycles affect our daily lives in many ways. A prime example of one of these cycles is the water cycle. The constant changing states of water and how it interacts with our environment ( both gas, ice, and liquid states). Some key words with the water cycle include condensation, precipitation, and evaporation</p><p></p><p>Another great example in our everyday lives is the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The constant respiration from animals and photosynthesis from plants creates a constant cycle which has been continuing for millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Other cycles include the nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, and sulfur cycle. Even today scientists are beginning to discover new cycles such as weather patterns, and human impact on the environment, which can drastically change the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles.</p><p></p><p>3. A biogeochemical cycle is a process where a type of element moves through nature. An element moves through nature by the break down and build up of molecules the element is a part of. To give an example, think about carbon. Carbon is present in gaseous CO2 in the atmosphere. Vegetation sequesters CO2 through photosynthesis. Plants turn CO2 into sugars to store energy absorbed by the sun. These sugars are then stored by the plant for later catabolic purpose.</p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Volcanoes are classified as active, dormant, or extinct. Active volcanoes have a recent history of eruptions; they are likely to erupt again. Dormant volcanoes have not erupted for a very long time but may erupt at a future time. Extinct volcanoes are not expected to erupt in the future.</p><p></p><p>2.The magma rises and collects in chambers within the crust. As magma fills the chamber, pressure grows. If the pressure gets high enough, the magma can break through the crust and spew out in a volcanic eruption. Most explosive volcanoes occur above subduction zones.</p><p></p><p>3.The three factors that influence the viscosity of a lava are temperature, the dissolved gases it contains, and its chemical composition.</p><p></p><p>4.Volcanoes are classified by the eruption type and by the volcanic cone shape. ...
