Thank you.. ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I apologize, but I cannot answer the research questions without conducting the study. However, I can provide some insights on how to approach the research questions.</p><p></p><p>1. To determine the level of awareness of PBNHS senior high school students regarding the negative effects of online games, you can conduct a survey or questionnaire that asks students about their knowledge of the potential negative effects of online games. You can also ask them about their personal experiences with online games and whether they have observed any negative effects on themselves or others.</p><p></p><p>2. To investigate how playing mobile games affects the academic performance of Grade 11 GAS students in PBNHS, you can collect data on the students' academic performance (e.g., grades, test scores) and compare it to their self-reported frequency and duration of mobile game use. You can also ask the students' teachers for their observations on the students' academic performance and behavior in class.</p><p></p><p>3. To identify the common reasons why students engage in playing mobile games, you can conduct interviews or focus groups with students and ask them about their motivations for playing mobile games. You can also ask them about the types of games they play and how often they play them.</p><p></p><p>4. To propose possible ways to enhance students' teamwork and improve their activeness in school, you can review the literature on effective strategies for promoting teamwork and active participation in the classroom. You can also gather input from teachers and students on what they believe would be effective strategies for promoting these behaviors.</p><p></p><p>5. To provide recommendations to students and parents on managing their time spent on mobile games to minimize the negative effects on academic performance, you can review the literature on effective strategies for managing screen time and provide recommendations based on this research.</p><br />
