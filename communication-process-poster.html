ADVOCACY CAMPAIGN
In order for you to connect yourself to people in your community, you need to make
some action. To help contribute on the advocacy campaign, let us focus on a problem/issue

just impart a message you need others to hear. Pictures and words together can illuminate
and convince to make change.

that can help you for your campaign. After making your poster, slogan or poem proceed in
answering the following processing questions:
PROCESSING QUESTIONS:

2. Do you think your poster or project done may inspire others? Why?
3. In what other ways you can extend your help to others in your community?
