                        The 20th century was dominated by a chain of events that heralded significant changes in world history as to redefine the era: Spanish flu pandemic, World War I and World War II, nuclear power and space exploration, nationalism and decolonization, the Cold War and post-Cold War conflicts; intergovernmental organizations and cultural homogenization through developments in emerging transportation and communications technology; poverty reduction and world population growth, awareness of environmental degradation, ecological extinction;[3][4] and the birth of the Digital Revolution, enabled by the wide adoption of MOS transistors and integrated circuits. It saw great advances in power generation, communication and medical technology that by the late 1980s allowed for near-instantaneous worldwide computer communication and genetic modification of life.<br />So it’s a bit confusing?<br />

                        <p>20th century dancing is now being studied using the same methods that have been applied to earlier periods. The written sources are, in principle, far more abundant and detailed (not only instruction manuals, but newspapers, magazines, posters, and programmes), but, in practice, they are still frustratingly difficult to locate. We have recorded music (on wax, shellac, vinyl, magnetic tape, CD, and digital media), but it is the invention of moving pictures, captured on photographic film or video, that has revolutionised our ability to study the actual movements of dancers in the 20th century. Nevertheless, even these are not universally available and do not always give the complete picture, so established methods of historical research are still required.</p><br />

                        The historical twentieth century began with the First World War in 1914 and ended seventy-five years later with the collapse of the Soviet Empire in 1989. The short century saw the end of European dominance and the rise of American power and influence throughout the world. The twentieth century was an American century—perhaps the American century. Lukacs explores in detail the phenomenon of national socialism (national socialist parties, he reminds us, have outlived the century), Hitler’s sole responsibility for the Second World War, and the crucial roles played by his determined opponents Churchill and Roosevelt. Between 1939 and 1942 Germany came closer to winning than many people suppose.<br /><br />Lukacs casts a hard eye at the consequences of the Second World War—the often misunderstood Soviet-American cold war—and at the shifting social and political developments in the Far and Middle East and elsewhere. In an eloquent closing meditation on the passing of the twentieth century, he reflects on the advance of democracy throughout the world and the limitations of human knowledge.<br /><br /><br />

Important as a stimulus to trade was the gradual elimination of the monopoly enjoyed by the galleon to Acapulco. The last galleon arrived in Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s Manila was open to foreign merchants almost without restriction. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</p><br />

                            29. similarities between 20th century music and 20th century artworks​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>What are the similarities between 20th century and 21st century music?</p><p>Popular music rises and drops in quality in an almost cyclic ‘tidal’ manner, by which I mean that - taken generally - the 1920s saw remarkable quality in popular music by the likes of Gershwin, Berlin and the amazingly prolific Cole Porter. This is not to recognise that the output of these and other composers did not span far wider in years: simply to state that at that point in time, popular music had hallmarks of quality, with great musical themes and clever, witty or poignant lyrics: the best of these songs were and remain minor masterpieces in their own right.</p><p></p><p>as the thirties became the forties, big band music was at its peak and again, a great flowering of musical talent developed with the likes of Artie Shaw, Duke Ellington (a great composer in his own right) and Glenn Miller.</p><p></p><p>Post WWII pop music became less innovative, appealing to the masses rather than to any discriminatory sense. At this time, the bands had failed in large part, mainly due to the spiralling costs of keeping a large number of good musicians together as a unit. There were a few exceptions but by and large, popular music became a source of inconsequential and sometimes downright silly recordings, epitomised in that respect by music pedants such as Mitch Miller at Columbia who forced good singers to make mediocre records in the name of sales. I’m thinking here of Sinatra and Bennett.</p><p></p><p>By about the middle of the fifties, the rock and roll era had begun with Presley and co. By the very early 60s, so-so ballads reigned supreme again. Nearer the middle 60s saw the amazing Beatles overturn the mediocre and replace it with, once again, quality. As the years went on, the Beach Boys, Bread and others again made great popular music. Some fine and innovative composers appear, such as Burt Bacharach and Carole King.</p><p></p><p>We hit the 70s and disco arrives, some of which is great, some less so.</p><p></p><p>There appears a vacuum after disco which became filled with an assortment of musical styles, often solo artists, some of who are far more than one hit wonders. Manufactured pop music such as the output of ‘the hit factory’ offered us Kylie Minogue and other stylised soloists and though some of this is still good to hear there is a nagging suspicion that we are being fed tasty but entirely non-nutritious food - musical no-brainers, if you will, all with a comforting similarity. Little in the way of ‘shock of the new’ - the aim here was always to sell in great volume and in that they were successful.</p><p></p><p>Little to say about the nineties.</p><p></p><p>As for the 21st century, far too much vocoding, autotuning and plastic-sounding artificiality for my liking. Put it down to my age if you will, but I am not a fan of RAP and I do like to hear the voice of a singer recorded in such a way as to reveal their true talent. What do I mean by that?</p><p></p><p>There has always been - present but hidden in the palm fronds out of sight of the strident pop music of the latter half of the 20th century - a form of music that has the hallmarks of true quality, in both the song writing and the performance. Outstanding for a very long period in this respect were Frank Sinatra, Sarah Vaughan, Billy Eckstein, Ella Fitzgerald, Billie Holiday. From a big band and jazz background, these artists are true quality, nothing artificial.</p><p></p><p>Where are these artistes today? Where is the new Sinatra? Vaughan? Holiday?</p><p></p><p>Step forward please, we need you. You can leave your vocoder behind.</p><p></p><br />

                            30. accepted in the 20th Century.20th Century is an era of varied musical styles.essay​</h2><br />
                        <p>During the 20th century, social changes combined with new technologies created a mass market for popular music and contributed to how music was created, shared, and appreciated. The advancement of technology had a huge impact on the evolution of music. Twentieth century music is very different than the music of previous centuries because musicians had more freedom to be creative. Musicians were very open to change and incorporated many aspects of the African culture. African music had a big influence on 20th century music, quickly became part of American culture, and helped lead to the creation of some of the genres now recognized as jazz, rhythm and blues, and rock and roll.</p><p>The early twentieth century saw a rise in popularity of jazz. It was a new kind of music that evolved in New Orleans. “Jazz is the product of many cultures and influences” (7). Jazz has its roots from “West African music, black folk and religious forms developed in the New World, and European popular and light classical music of the 18th and 19th centuries.” (Jazz..). Jazz evolved from African chants and spirituals. It is music with a history and is very deeply engrained in American culture. Jazz music is usually played with the trumpet, saxophone, trombone, piano, and/or guitar. The most famous of the jazz musicians was Louis Armstrong. He was a trumpeter, composer, and singer. His first record was made in Chicago in the 1920s.</p><br />
