                                            The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (About this soundlisten); Filipino: Pilipinas),[13] officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas),[d] is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest, and shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia and Brunei to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2020, had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's twelfth-most populous country. The Philippines is a multinational state, with diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City, both lying within the urban area of Metro Manila.
Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of Animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino rebels declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution.
It is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. The Philippines' position as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant level of biodiversity. This low-lying island geography makes the country vulnerable to climate change, increasing risk from typhoons and sea level rise.</a>

This change is expected as the country remains heavily reliant onhighly polluting fossil fuel energy sources across all sectors," the report said.For the first two weeks of May, nitrogen dioxide, which is produced throughroad traffic and fossil fuel combustion, increased by almost 50 percentcompared to the last two weeks of April. Significant increases in NO, levelswere observed in Marikina, San Juan, and Makuti "where levels more thandou bied in comparison to the last week of April."When Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) started duringthe latter half of May, Makati and Pasig's NO. levels jumped by around 75percent from the previous week.Unlike NO2, the report said that PM2.5, which can cause serious healthproblems such as lung cancer, "did not dramatically rebound with theMECO."One possible explanation for this is that transportation activities withincities remain limited, even with the increase of vehicles and traffic on majorroads and highways, the report said.Caloocan's pollution levels remained high despite the quarantine while PasigCity had the most sustained improvements" for both pollutants.With the metropolis shilling to looser restrictions on travel and otheractivities under the general community quarantine (GCO) starting June 1, areturn to smog and pollution levels prior to the ECO may not be far behind,"Greenpeace said in a statement.The group pointed out that exposure to pollutants affects a person'simmune system and increases vulnerability to illnesses like COVID-19. Italso has negative elfects on food and water systems, and the climate."The ECQ gave Filipino citizens a glimpse of what cities can be like withhealthy, clean air," said Greenpeace campaigner Rhea Jane PescadorMallari."Moving forward, if the government is willing to use the opportunities andlessons learned from the pandemic and amplify it through policies andinfrastructure, active mobility and micro mobility, as well ns invest inEllicient and safe mase public transport, then a return to the massivepollution levels before COVID- 19 can be vyoided.CREA analyst Isabella Suarez meanwhile said that instead of a "newnormal," the Philippines should pursue a "better normal" that includesensuring good air quality,The group also recommended flexible remote work arrangements, whichincludes staggered work shifts, and people-centric urban design. They alsocalled for the rebuilding of trust in mass transit."Rather than banning the mass transport systems, providing clear guidancefor safety and implementing sanitation measures like cleaning regimes,issuing PPEs to drivers and staff; mandating face coverings for passengers;and increasing trips to account for limiting the number of passengers perride could safely allow the rail transit system, bunes and public uulityvehicles to run and leasen private vehicles on the road in the short term,the groups said,They also called for the promotion of low-cost and carbou-noutral optionssuch as electric-powered jeepneys and bikes, apart from the implementationof stricter standards for industrial air pollution and vehicle emissions,Questions:1 What environmental issue is being stated in the news report?2 What is the cause of the stated environmental issue?3 Do you have a suggestion on how this problem can be lessened?

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."

                            5. The Philippines (/ˈfɪlɪpiːnz/ (About this soundlisten); Filipino: Pilipinas),[13] officially the Republic of the Philippines (Filipino: Republika ng Pilipinas),[d] is an archipelagic country in Southeast Asia. It is situated in the western Pacific Ocean, and consists of about 7,640 islands, that are broadly categorized under three main geographical divisions from north to south: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. The Philippines is bounded by the South China Sea to the west, the Philippine Sea to the east, and the Celebes Sea to the southwest, and shares maritime borders with Taiwan to the north, Japan to the northeast, Palau to the east and southeast, Indonesia to the south, Malaysia and Brunei to the southwest, Vietnam to the west, and China to the northwest. The Philippines covers an area of 300,000 km2 (120,000 sq mi) and, as of 2020, had a population of around 109 million people, making it the world's twelfth-most populous country. The Philippines is a multinational state, with diverse ethnicities and cultures throughout its islands. Manila is the nation's capital, while the largest city is Quezon City, both lying within the urban area of Metro Manila.
Negritos, some of the archipelago's earliest inhabitants, were followed by successive waves of Austronesian peoples. Adoption of Animism, Hinduism and Islam established island-kingdoms called Kedatuans, Rajahnates and Sultanates. The arrival of Ferdinand Magellan, a Portuguese explorer leading a fleet for Spain, marked the beginning of Spanish colonization. In 1543, Spanish explorer Ruy López de Villalobos named the archipelago Las Islas Filipinas in honor of Philip II of Spain. Spanish settlement through Mexico, beginning in 1565, led to the Philippines becoming part of the Spanish Empire for more than 300 years. During this time, Catholicism became the dominant religion, and Manila became the western hub of trans-Pacific trade. In 1896, the Philippine Revolution began, which then became entwined with the 1898 Spanish–American War. Spain ceded the territory to the United States, while Filipino rebels declared the First Philippine Republic. The ensuing Philippine–American War ended with the United States establishing control over the territory, which they maintained until the Japanese invasion of the islands during World War II. Following liberation, the Philippines became independent in 1946. Since then, the unitary sovereign state has often had a tumultuous experience with democracy, which included the overthrow of a dictatorship by the People Power Revolution.
It is considered to be an emerging market and a newly industrialized country, which has an economy transitioning from being based on agriculture to being based more on services and manufacturing. The Philippines is a founding member of the United Nations, World Trade Organization, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum, and the East Asia Summit. The Philippines' position as an island country on the Pacific Ring of Fire and close to the equator makes the country prone to earthquakes and typhoons. The country has a variety of natural resources and a globally significant level of biodiversity. This low-lying island geography makes the country vulnerable to climate change, increasing risk from typhoons and sea level rise.</h2><br />

This change is expected as the country remains heavily reliant onhighly polluting fossil fuel energy sources across all sectors," the report said.For the first two weeks of May, nitrogen dioxide, which is produced throughroad traffic and fossil fuel combustion, increased by almost 50 percentcompared to the last two weeks of April. Significant increases in NO, levelswere observed in Marikina, San Juan, and Makuti "where levels more thandou bied in comparison to the last week of April."When Modified Enhanced Community Quarantine (MECQ) started duringthe latter half of May, Makati and Pasig's NO. levels jumped by around 75percent from the previous week.Unlike NO2, the report said that PM2.5, which can cause serious healthproblems such as lung cancer, "did not dramatically rebound with theMECO."One possible explanation for this is that transportation activities withincities remain limited, even with the increase of vehicles and traffic on majorroads and highways, the report said.Caloocan's pollution levels remained high despite the quarantine while PasigCity had the most sustained improvements" for both pollutants.With the metropolis shilling to looser restrictions on travel and otheractivities under the general community quarantine (GCO) starting June 1, areturn to smog and pollution levels prior to the ECO may not be far behind,"Greenpeace said in a statement.The group pointed out that exposure to pollutants affects a person'simmune system and increases vulnerability to illnesses like COVID-19. Italso has negative elfects on food and water systems, and the climate."The ECQ gave Filipino citizens a glimpse of what cities can be like withhealthy, clean air," said Greenpeace campaigner Rhea Jane PescadorMallari."Moving forward, if the government is willing to use the opportunities andlessons learned from the pandemic and amplify it through policies andinfrastructure, active mobility and micro mobility, as well ns invest inEllicient and safe mase public transport, then a return to the massivepollution levels before COVID- 19 can be vyoided.CREA analyst Isabella Suarez meanwhile said that instead of a "newnormal," the Philippines should pursue a "better normal" that includesensuring good air quality,The group also recommended flexible remote work arrangements, whichincludes staggered work shifts, and people-centric urban design. They alsocalled for the rebuilding of trust in mass transit."Rather than banning the mass transport systems, providing clear guidancefor safety and implementing sanitation measures like cleaning regimes,issuing PPEs to drivers and staff; mandating face coverings for passengers;and increasing trips to account for limiting the number of passengers perride could safely allow the rail transit system, bunes and public uulityvehicles to run and leasen private vehicles on the road in the short term,the groups said,They also called for the promotion of low-cost and carbou-noutral optionssuch as electric-powered jeepneys and bikes, apart from the implementationof stricter standards for industrial air pollution and vehicle emissions,Questions:1 What environmental issue is being stated in the news report?2 What is the cause of the stated environmental issue?3 Do you have a suggestion on how this problem can be lessened?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Air quality in Metro Manila is returning to its usual noxious levels as Covid-19 lockdown measures are loosened up. But this backslide into business-as-usual can be preempted if local governments adapt existing measures and transition to cleaner energy technologies, a new report says.

Qutput number 1: Read the excerpt from an article below, then in your intermediate paper, answer the questions that follow. Overdue jeepney fare hike rate to be released earliest next week' MANILA, Philippines - The Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) said that it expects to release the rate of the long-overdue jeepney fare hikes as early as next week. LTFRB Chairperson Cheloy Velicaria-Garafil said they are still weighing how much out of the P3 to P4 additional fare petition will be imposed on commuters. The regulatory board required jeepney groups to file a position paper or a memorandum within 15 days since their last hearing with the regulatory board held August 18. "We're waiting for their memorandum on September 3 and then we will act accordingly so we can expect that their rate hike petition resolution will happen at the earliest on the first week of September or, at the latest, second week of September," Velicaria-Garafil said in mixed English and Filipino during a briefing with reporters on Monday. Aside from jeepneys, the LTFRB is also looking at six other pending fare hike cases, including those from transportation network vehicle services, from taxi operators, point-to-point operators, UV Express services, and from bus operators Source: https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2022/08/29/2205932/overdue-jeepney-fare-hike-rate-be-released-earliest-next-week 1. What does fare hike mean? 2. What reason is mentioned in the article for imposing a fare hike? 3. How does this news affect you as a commuter and as a student? 4. Do you believe that the information presented is true or accurate? Why or why not? 5. As a student, what is the importance of reading this kind of material? Qutput number 2: Create your own quotation about Modern-day heroes. Be creative. Example: Beginning Tuesday, diesel prices across the country will see a P6.10-per-liter price hike. Velicaria-Garafil noted that the last time the regulatory board imposed a fare hike was when diesel cost around P44 per liter, half of what it costs now. Some transport groups have stopped plying their routes because their earnings can no longer keep up with operational costs as pump prices continue to increase. The government has launched a fuel subsidy program for public utility vehicle operators, but that has since ended for jeepney drivers. "NOT ALL HEROES FLY, SOME GOOK. HEAL, AND MAKE YOU ALWAYS TRY."
