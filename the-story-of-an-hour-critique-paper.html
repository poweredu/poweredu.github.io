                            6. Using historical approach, write a critique paper about the story "Voices" by Alice Munro i need this pls answer:(​</h2><br />
                        "Voices" by Alice Munro is a short story that explores the themes of memory, identity, and the complexities of human relationships. By examining the story through a historical approach, it is possible to gain a deeper understanding of its underlying social and cultural contexts, as well as its significance within the broader literary tradition.<br /><br />The story is set in the mid-20th century, in a small rural town in Canada, where the protagonist, the narrator, reflects on her past and her relationships with various family members and acquaintances. The historical context of the story is important, as it reflects the changing social and cultural landscape of Canada during this time. The story takes place in a post-World War II era, where the traditional gender roles and social hierarchies were being challenged by the feminist and civil rights movements. The story also addresses the impact of the war on the lives of ordinary people, particularly women, and how it shaped their experiences and identities.<br /><br />One of the most significant aspects of the story is its portrayal of the complexities of human relationships. Munro's characters are portrayed as flawed and imperfect, struggling to connect with each other and often failing in their attempts to do so. The story suggests that the complexities of human relationships are rooted in our individual experiences and memories, and that our sense of identity is shaped by the people and events that have influenced us.<br /><br />Furthermore, the story highlights the importance of memory in shaping our sense of self and our relationships with others. The narrator's memories of her past, particularly her childhood, play a central role in the story. Munro suggests that our memories are not fixed, but are instead subject to revision and reinterpretation, and that our understanding of our past is shaped by our current circumstances and relationships.<br /><br />In conclusion, "Voices" by Alice Munro is a powerful and thought-provoking story that offers a nuanced exploration of memory, identity, and the complexities of human relationships. By examining the story through a historical approach, we can gain a deeper understanding of its significance within the broader literary tradition and its relevance to the social and cultural context of its time. Munro's vivid and nuanced portrayal of her characters and their relationships make "Voices" a valuable contribution to the literary canon and a compelling commentary on the human condition.<br /><br />Makinig ka kasi!<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>The story I have chosen to critique is "The Cat with One Tail" by Agatha Christie.</p><p></p><p>This story, written by Agatha Christie, tells the tale of a mysterious cat that appears in an English village one day, with only one tail. As the villagers try to unravel the secret behind the cat's strange appearance, they uncover a surprising and sinister mystery.</p><p></p><p>The main strength of this story lies in its atmosphere. Through her vivid descriptions of the English countryside, Christie creates an eerie and unsettling mood that is further enhanced by the presence of the mysterious cat. There is a strong feeling of unease as the villagers attempt to unravel the cat's secret, and Christie does an excellent job of conveying this tension throughout the narrative.</p><p></p><p>The plot of the story is also well-crafted and engaging. Christie builds up the mystery gradually, allowing for suspense to build before finally revealing the cat's true identity. The twists and turns are cleverly done, and the reader is kept guessing until the very end.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the characters in this story are believable and sympathetic. The villagers have distinct personalities and motivations, and their conversations feel real and authentic.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Christie's writing style is elegant and precise. Her prose is descriptive and lyrical, and her use of imagery helps to bring the story to life.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, this is an excellent story that has a great atmosphere, a well-crafted plot, believable characters, and beautiful writing. I highly recommend it.</p><br />

His success continued, because of this Keesh was looked upon with great respect and he got an biggest igloo by the people there made for him. But the men there didn’t believe Keesh could hunt by himself, so they decided to spy on him. And they finally found out the reason why Keesh were so successful, is not about magic or anythings. It’s because Keesh always readied some little round ice balls made by bones and whale meat. When the bear swallowed the ball, the bear would get sick and Keesh could kill it easily. Because he used his brain to hunt, he rose to power and became the chief of his village and no one was left hungry again.</p><p>reaction: i just get amazed in that story because of his strong personality that he really proove his self to the council.</p><br /><br />

                            17. give me a critique paper of the story of "A rose for Emily" by William Faulkner​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>"A Rose for Emily" by William Faulkner </strong></p><p>is a short story that explores themes of isolation, tradition, and the passing of time. The story is narrated by an unnamed narrator who speaks on behalf of the entire town of Jefferson, Mississippi. The narrator recounts the life of Emily Grierson, a reclusive woman who has lived in isolation for most of her life.</p><p></p><p>One of the strengths of this story is the way Faulkner uses a non-linear narrative structure to reveal the events of Emily's life. The story jumps back and forth in time, adding layers of meaning and complexity to the characters and their actions. This structure also creates a sense of mystery and intrigue, keeping the reader engaged until the end.</p><p></p><p>Another strength of the story is the way Faulkner uses symbols to add depth and meaning to the narrative. The title of the story, "A Rose for Emily," is a symbol of the love and affection that Emily never received. The rose also symbolizes Emily's fading beauty and the fleeting nature of life. Similarly, the house that Emily lives in is also symbolic, representing the decay of the Old South and the way time has passed it by.</p><p></p><p>However, one of the weaknesses of the story is the way the narrator speaks on behalf of the entire town of Jefferson. This creates a sense of homogeneity in the characters, and it is difficult to understand the motivations and feelings of individual characters. The narrator's voice also reinforces the idea that the town is complicit in Emily's isolation and her eventual descent into madness.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "A Rose for Emily" is a powerful and evocative story that explores themes of isolation, tradition, and the passing of time. The non-linear narrative structure and the use of symbols add depth and complexity to the story, but the use of a collective narrator diminishes the individuality of the characters. Despite this weakness, "A Rose for Emily" is a masterful and thought-provoking story that will continue to be studied and enjoyed for many years to come.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The author uses Athena, the goddess of war and wisdom, and Arachne, a simple mortal, to prove the importance of being humble. This is evident through the fact that a mere mortal challenged a goddess who believed herself to be superior. Secondly, Arachne was convinced that she was the best weaver, never showing modesty of her talent. Lastly, Arachne was taught not to defy a god and yet did not care to go against that.</p><br />
