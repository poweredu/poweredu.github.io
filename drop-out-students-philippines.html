                                            DIRECTIONS: Identify whether the statement is FOR OR AGAINST the presented issue. 1. In March, Malacañang said the government showed "excellent management of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying it has brought the crisis under control compared to richer countries. 2. A consultant to the government's task force had also said the Philippines was faring better han other countries in responding to the pandemic. The raging crisis has so far claimed over 13,800 lives in the Country. Total infections stood at more than 812,000, among the worsi in Southeast Asia. 3. It is a relief to see that Covid-19 cases in Davao City have steadily dropped in the past several weeks. This is thanks to the hard work of everyone involved in the management of the Covid-19 disease 4. Academic break is not only for the students, it is also for the faculty and staff who are mostly the heads of their families. We aren't even learning anymore; we are just trying to survive. 5. Academic break would allow students and faculty members to focus on "more pressing Dersonal concerns, such as taking care of close or distant family members greatly affected by the typhoons. leaning or rebuilding their homes, as well as maybe restart with their main or other sources of livelihood." 6. Filipinos will be in living heli if the ECQ gets extended. The sudden lockdown in itself is an added burden as millions have already lost their jobs in the middle of a worsening pandemic 7. Children deserve to grow up safe and healthy, regardless of their family's income. Cash benefits and other programmes make a difference and give children a chance at a happy, productive future 8. Seek a lifestyle that limits the large-scale consumption of energy (electricity, oil) for every person. Improve environmental education which makes this way of thinking known and send out information from the regions. 9. The pollution situation would become more and more severe, and we would not have clean water to drink. Neither food nor air would be safe. 10. Technology helps advance the human race forward and makes doing mundane things more efficient and repeatable. Technology has helped create the information revolution.Pasagot po ng maayos thank you in advance ​</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 1: You be the Judge of it! Though it seems that society is winning in the battle against illegal drug use and abuse, I believe that we are still a long way from declaring victory in the battle. Teenagers are still victimized by drug addiction. Everyone complains? But only a few are some suggestions to stop this terrible and frightening habit. First, the film industry should stop glamorizing drug addiction. Drug addicts and drug pushers should not come out as heroes and saints in films and television programs. They should realize that young people look up to these actors and actresses and what they portray on camera is something that looks cool and good for the young viewers. The government and the actors' guild should come up with a law banning the industry from showing drugs of all forms on television and film. Second, the government should have strict laws and policies on drug trafficking and possession of drugs and their paraphernalia. We should follow our neighboring countries which include death penalties as sanction to drug traffickers. Right now, the Philippines serve as a drop-off point for drugs coming from other countries. Drug Laboratories have been discovered in residential houses and old abandoned factories. Foreign members of syndicates have been caught and charged by authorities. These are proofs that there is a need to review and revise our present laws on drug abuse and trafficking. Third, horrific videos of people dying from drug-related illnesses should be used by the government as advocacy materials for students to see and know the real deal about drug use and abuse. If students will understand the ugly truth about drugs through these advocacies and they will no longer start to take drugs, then the approach will be effective and the experience worthwhile. There are still more ideas I can share with you regarding drug abuse prevention but I think that these three suggestions are more than enough to change the scenario. My parting words are to "think several times before acting out foolishly". The Editor - 1. Questions: What are the ideas of the editor to stop drug use, abuse, and drug trafficking?

                            6. DIRECTIONS: Identify whether the statement is FOR OR AGAINST the presented issue. 1. In March, Malacañang said the government showed "excellent management of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying it has brought the crisis under control compared to richer countries. 2. A consultant to the government's task force had also said the Philippines was faring better han other countries in responding to the pandemic. The raging crisis has so far claimed over 13,800 lives in the Country. Total infections stood at more than 812,000, among the worsi in Southeast Asia. 3. It is a relief to see that Covid-19 cases in Davao City have steadily dropped in the past several weeks. This is thanks to the hard work of everyone involved in the management of the Covid-19 disease 4. Academic break is not only for the students, it is also for the faculty and staff who are mostly the heads of their families. We aren't even learning anymore; we are just trying to survive. 5. Academic break would allow students and faculty members to focus on "more pressing Dersonal concerns, such as taking care of close or distant family members greatly affected by the typhoons. leaning or rebuilding their homes, as well as maybe restart with their main or other sources of livelihood." 6. Filipinos will be in living heli if the ECQ gets extended. The sudden lockdown in itself is an added burden as millions have already lost their jobs in the middle of a worsening pandemic 7. Children deserve to grow up safe and healthy, regardless of their family's income. Cash benefits and other programmes make a difference and give children a chance at a happy, productive future 8. Seek a lifestyle that limits the large-scale consumption of energy (electricity, oil) for every person. Improve environmental education which makes this way of thinking known and send out information from the regions. 9. The pollution situation would become more and more severe, and we would not have clean water to drink. Neither food nor air would be safe. 10. Technology helps advance the human race forward and makes doing mundane things more efficient and repeatable. Technology has helped create the information revolution.Pasagot po ng maayos thank you in advance ​</h2><br />

                            7. ACTIVITY 1: You be the Judge of it! Though it seems that society is winning in the battle against illegal drug use and abuse, I believe that we are still a long way from declaring victory in the battle. Teenagers are still victimized by drug addiction. Everyone complains? But only a few are some suggestions to stop this terrible and frightening habit. First, the film industry should stop glamorizing drug addiction. Drug addicts and drug pushers should not come out as heroes and saints in films and television programs. They should realize that young people look up to these actors and actresses and what they portray on camera is something that looks cool and good for the young viewers. The government and the actors' guild should come up with a law banning the industry from showing drugs of all forms on television and film. Second, the government should have strict laws and policies on drug trafficking and possession of drugs and their paraphernalia. We should follow our neighboring countries which include death penalties as sanction to drug traffickers. Right now, the Philippines serve as a drop-off point for drugs coming from other countries. Drug Laboratories have been discovered in residential houses and old abandoned factories. Foreign members of syndicates have been caught and charged by authorities. These are proofs that there is a need to review and revise our present laws on drug abuse and trafficking. Third, horrific videos of people dying from drug-related illnesses should be used by the government as advocacy materials for students to see and know the real deal about drug use and abuse. If students will understand the ugly truth about drugs through these advocacies and they will no longer start to take drugs, then the approach will be effective and the experience worthwhile. There are still more ideas I can share with you regarding drug abuse prevention but I think that these three suggestions are more than enough to change the scenario. My parting words are to "think several times before acting out foolishly". The Editor - 1. Questions: What are the ideas of the editor to stop drug use, abuse, and drug trafficking? Summarize these ideas. 2. Do you think the idea of the editor will be effective? Why or why not? 3. Do you have other ideas that might help stop drug use, abuse, and trafficking?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>ILLEGAL DRUGS<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>drug</strong> is a substance that influences the manner in which the body capacities. Assuming a drug is delegated 'illicit', this implies that it is prohibited by law. Different illicit <strong>drugs</strong> effectsly affect individuals and these impacts are affected by many elements. <strong>Drug</strong> makes them flighty and risky, particularly for youngsters. Depressants are drugs that log jam the focal sensory system and the messages that go between the mind and the body. These <strong>drugs</strong> decline individuals' focus and dial back their capacity to react. The name 'depressant' recommends that these drugs can cause an individual to feel discouraged, yet this isn't generally the situation. The term depressant simply alludes with the impact of dialing back the focal sensory system. A few instances of depressants include: liquor, narcotics barbiturates, GHB.</p><p></p><p>Stimulants are <strong>drugs</strong> which normally adjust how an individual sees the world. These drugs can change the manner in which an individual sees, hears, tastes, scents or feels various things, including encountering things that aren't there in any way.
