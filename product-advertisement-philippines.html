                                            Basically, advertising succeeds because it appeals to our weaknesses. What are these weaknesses? May be, first of all, we all want to be good-looking and most of us want to appeal to the opposite sex. So if an advertisement implies that this kind of shirt or that brand of soap will give us that kind of sex appeal, we will be interested in the product even if subconsciously. The ad may do this rather subtly, simply by showing for instance, a young man wearing the shirt in question surrounded by women.The point, then, is quite clear even without the use of a single word. Other advertisements may seek to persuade us that such a product may give us an aura of success, or make our children fat and healthy or keep us from being ostracized by groups in elevators. The principle, however, is the same promise them what they want and they will buy. If we we were without such weaknesses and desires, we would doubtless buy much less.

                            15. Basically, advertising succeeds because it appeals to our weaknesses. What are these weaknesses? May be, first of all, we all want to be good-looking and most of us want to appeal to the opposite sex. So if an advertisement implies that this kind of shirt or that brand of soap will give us that kind of sex appeal, we will be interested in the product even if subconsciously. The ad may do this rather subtly, simply by showing for instance, a young man wearing the shirt in question surrounded by women.The point, then, is quite clear even without the use of a single word. Other advertisements may seek to persuade us that such a product may give us an aura of success, or make our children fat and healthy or keep us from being ostracized by groups in elevators. The principle, however, is the same promise them what they want and they will buy. If we we were without such weaknesses and desires, we would doubtless buy much less. (Philippine Daily Inquirer, July 9, 1997)From the text reading on Activity A, paraphrase or explain it in a paragraph form using your own words. Write on a whole sheet of yellow paper.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Paraphrasing is an activity to re-express a sentence or text using our own language without removing the message or essence of the original sentence or text.</strong></p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of our weaknesses is probably one of the reasons why advertising can be successful. Weakness can be a desire. For example, such as the desire to be handsome and look attractive in the girl's eye. With that, advertisers will try to subtly imply that our desires can be achieved by using their products so that we will unconsciously be attracted. For example, by showing men surrounded by women because they are wearing advertised shirts.</p><p>Even without using a single word they can make us interested. And other advertisements will also convince us that the product can give us an aura of success, make our children healthy, or keep us from being isolated in the elevator. The bottom line, however, is that they will see our weaknesses and promise that they will provide us with a solution using their product. If we don't have weaknesses or desires as mentioned, can be sure we will not be too interested and buy a less product.
