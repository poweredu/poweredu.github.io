Javier In a faraway mountain, there was a happy couple Ethel and Ariel living together with a very simple life. They used to live in a NIPA hut, eat foods from their farm, and catch fishes from the river. The husband was a farmer working all day at the farm. He always prayed that someday the Almighty Father will give them a child which is the only thing they wished for. One night, when they were sleeping, they heard a horrible sound from the surrounding. When the husband was awakened, he looked where it came from Surprisingly a bright light flashed on her eyes and he saw a beautiful fairy smiling at him. "Good Man", the fairy said." You've been working so hard in the farm, taking good care of your wife. I want to give you a simple gift for all your kindness. When the farmer heard her offer, he was terribly happy with tears saying, "I want to have a child". And the fairy just smiled at him and said" Your wish is granted" she immediately disappeared. From that moment he gave all the needs of her wife. He brought her fruits and fresh vegetables every day from the farm. He didn't let her wife worked and feel tired because he loved her so much. Moments passed by, when her wife cooked foods for him, she was really in pain because she was able to deliver her baby. The husband was very aggressive to see her baby and it was very successful. At last her wife gave birth to a very beautiful baby and they named her Fairysha. The name was originally got from the Fairy who gave them gift The baby girl grew full of love with their parents and also, they thought her to be kind always and God fearing. And they lived happlly as a perfect family. YOUR SUMMARY​</a>

Javier In a faraway mountain, there was a happy couple Ethel and Ariel living together with a very simple life. They used to live in a NIPA hut, eat foods from their farm, and catch fishes from the river. The husband was a farmer working all day at the farm. He always prayed that someday the Almighty Father will give them a child which is the only thing they wished for. One night, when they were sleeping, they heard a horrible sound from the surrounding. When the husband was awakened, he looked where it came from Surprisingly a bright light flashed on her eyes and he saw a beautiful fairy smiling at him. "Good Man", the fairy said." You've been working so hard in the farm, taking good care of your wife. I want to give you a simple gift for all your kindness. When the farmer heard her offer, he was terribly happy with tears saying, "I want to have a child". And the fairy just smiled at him and said" Your wish is granted" she immediately disappeared. From that moment he gave all the needs of her wife. He brought her fruits and fresh vegetables every day from the farm. He didn't let her wife worked and feel tired because he loved her so much. Moments passed by, when her wife cooked foods for him, she was really in pain because she was able to deliver her baby. The husband was very aggressive to see her baby and it was very successful. At last her wife gave birth to a very beautiful baby and they named her Fairysha. The name was originally got from the Fairy who gave them gift The baby girl grew full of love with their parents and also, they thought her to be kind always and God fearing. And they lived happlly as a perfect family. YOUR SUMMARY​</h2><br />
