Walter then employs the phrase to illustrate how women keep men from achieving their goals--every time a man gets exited about something. he claims, a woman tries to temper his enthusiasm by telling him to eat his eggs, Being quiet and eating one's eggs represents an acceptance of the adversity that Walter and the rest of the youngers face in life.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. What is the concern of the moon regarding his stars?</p><p></p><p>The moon was worried about the sun being so fond of their children-the stars. Whenever the sun embraces their children-the stars, they burn which was why the moon has then forbid the sun from going near their children.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. Why does the moon anger the sun?</p><p></p><p>I think it's the other way around. It's the sun who angered the moon for not following the instruction of not touching their children who have now perished. The moon then threw a banana tree to strike the sun. If the moon ever angered the sun, it could be because of this. And so, the sun also threw sand on the moon's face.</p><p></p><p></p><p>3. What particular phenomenon is described in the Filipino Folktale?</p><p></p><p>I believe this folktale tells us why the sun and the moon never meet. The sun only shows up at daytime and the moon at nightime. They were not in good terms. They are chasing after each other bu they never meet. (Except for extraordinary phenomena like the eclipse.)</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
