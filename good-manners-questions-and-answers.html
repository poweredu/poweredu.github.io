                                            One morning there was a loud knock at Dean Swift's door. The servant opened it.
A man handed her a fine duck and said, "Here's a present for the Dean. It's from Mr. Boyle." Without a word, he walked away. Mr. Boyle was a sporting neighbor and he was an admirer of Dean Swift. The next time, the man brought a quail. "Here's something else for the Dean," he said roughly, and tossed it into the servant's arms. "That fellow has no manners," she said."The next time he comes," said the Dean, "let me know, and I will go to the door." It was not long until the man came with a present. The Dean went to the door."Here's a rabbit from Mr. Boyle," said the man."See here," said the Dean in a stern voice, "that is not the way to deliver a message. Just step inside and make believe that you are Dean Swift. I will go out and make believe that I am bringing him a present." "I'l agree to that," said the man; and he stepped inside. The Dean took the rabbit and went out. Then he knocked gently at the door. The door was opened by the man. The Dean bowed and said, "If you please, sir, Mr. Boyle's compliments, and he wishes you to accept this fine rabbit." "Oh, thank you," said the man very politely. Then, he offered the Dean a shilling. "And here is something for your trouble." The lesson in manners was not forgotten; the man was always very polite when he brought his presents. And the Dean always gives the man a "tip" for his trouble. Jonathan Swift, often called Dean Swift, was famous as a writer. Among other books he wrote "Gulliver's Travels." Answer the questions,
1.Why was the messenger sent by Mr. Boyle? What presents did he deliver?
2.Why did the servant complain about the messenger?
3.What did Dean Swift do to teach the messenger about good manners?
4.What happened after the encounter between Dean Swift and the messenger?
5.What lesson did you learn from the story?
6.What are situations where you should show good manners?</a>

                            1. arts essay 50 points direction answer the question below in conscious manner 1 what made a good artist​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Art expresses emotions or is an expression of life. Art is a creation that allows for interpretation of any kind. I have read that art is considered a human skill as opposed to nature, a skill applied to music, painting, poetry etc. I believe that nature is an art as well. If something is made by someone or by nature in a certain way, then it’s unique and special in its own way.
</p><p>
</p><p>Artists will use their unique form of artwork to pass along their views and feelings. The importance and value of art and the artist to society has remained constant throughout history. An innovative way of viewing the world or society around us is produced by the artist through his/her art. Interpreting art depends on a person or artist experiences, their associations, visionary thoughts and culture.
</p><p>
</p><p>Art is just like love and has so many definitions and examples for each. Therefore, I believe that art is not about perfection; art is something that continues to develop and grow as it is seen, meaning to open all generations of emotions, thoughts and human capacities.</p><p></p><p>Art is a creation through observation and interpretation of the art and the portrayal of their craft by the artist in whatever way they want whether it is viewed the same way as the observer or any way they see it. Intelligible and recognized thoughts and emotions of the world is considered to be art. Within the emotions and thoughts of the world, art enables those experiences to be intelligible and recognized.
</p><p>
</p><p>Watson’s famous painting is “Peace and love” where he uses the principle elements to deliver the message of love and peace. Colour is the most dominant and prominent element he uses in the painting. The colour blue is used by him to represent peace and the emotion notion that one may notice when one look at the piece. To support specific important aspect like love, power and strength among blacks, he uses a small amount of red throughout the piece. Brown is used to representing the feeling of home and its comfort. In the background, the use of blue by Watson with a hint of criss-cross lines that coupled with the subject’s hair adds non-tactile depth and texture to the painting.</p><p></p><p>The subject Rastafarian is used by Watson because Rastafarians are usually associated with peace and meditation. If art is considered to be an action, then the person who acts is known as an artist. A person who performs various activities and are considered to be art then the person in a descriptive term called an artist.
</p><p>
</p><p>Communication through art is what the artist use in their craft and works. For the long term, Jamaican artists were known to portray strong feeling through their work and art. Each art and the work in its way represented some ideas, emotions or feelings in either two dimensional or three-dimensional forms.
</p><p>
</p><p>The work of art can either be a real piece or an abstract one depicting or telling stories and ideas. For most people, a piece of art that seem to stir the feelings and emotions of the viewer considers the main enjoyment in art. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope it helps :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>aa</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The best soil for most plants to ensure optimum growth is a rich, sandy loam. This soil is an even mixture of all three main types of soil. In most cases, you'll need to amend the soil with compost.</p><p></p><br />

Having another subject may be hard for students, since almost all things that a student needs to know is already divided by different subjects, therefore it's better to not add any more further subjects.</p><p>5. It will be a great help for us students, though it can cause other students or learners to become stressed on school since most students have a lot of subjects to review and that many subjects already stressed them a lot.</p><p>6.

                            11. One morning there was a loud knock at Dean Swift's door. The servant opened it.
A man handed her a fine duck and said, "Here's a present for the Dean. It's from Mr. Boyle." Without a word, he walked away. Mr. Boyle was a sporting neighbor and he was an admirer of Dean Swift. The next time, the man brought a quail. "Here's something else for the Dean," he said roughly, and tossed it into the servant's arms. "That fellow has no manners," she said."The next time he comes," said the Dean, "let me know, and I will go to the door." It was not long until the man came with a present. The Dean went to the door."Here's a rabbit from Mr. Boyle," said the man."See here," said the Dean in a stern voice, "that is not the way to deliver a message. Just step inside and make believe that you are Dean Swift. I will go out and make believe that I am bringing him a present." "I'l agree to that," said the man; and he stepped inside. The Dean took the rabbit and went out. Then he knocked gently at the door. The door was opened by the man. The Dean bowed and said, "If you please, sir, Mr. Boyle's compliments, and he wishes you to accept this fine rabbit." "Oh, thank you," said the man very politely. Then, he offered the Dean a shilling. "And here is something for your trouble." The lesson in manners was not forgotten; the man was always very polite when he brought his presents. And the Dean always gives the man a "tip" for his trouble. Jonathan Swift, often called Dean Swift, was famous as a writer. Among other books he wrote "Gulliver's Travels." Answer the questions,
1.Why was the messenger sent by Mr. Boyle? What presents did he deliver?
2.Why did the servant complain about the messenger?
3.What did Dean Swift do to teach the messenger about good manners?
4.What happened after the encounter between Dean Swift and the messenger?
5.What lesson did you learn from the story?
6.What are situations where you should show good manners?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The messenger was sent by Mr. Boyle to deliver presents to Dean Swift. He delivered a duck, a quail, and a rabbit.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The servant complained about the messenger because he had no manners and delivered the presents roughly.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Dean Swift taught the messenger about good manners by having him come inside and pretend to be Dean Swift while he pretended to be the messenger delivering the present.
