                                            space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers. Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city. The phase out doesn't mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there. Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules sot they don't have to clog loading/ unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn't have to wait long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience. Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips. Use the Pasig River. They Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one, why was it discontinued?) And hurry up the C-5 and the C-6... Answer the following questions. 1. Which idea in the reading text do you agree the most? Why? 2.

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)  
By: Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phase out. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule.
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the driver earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes- is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and mediocre premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in may cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminal- and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in passengers of ten jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was a great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading//unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats are small. Hongkong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

  Mr. Arturo plans to open his own travel agency. And he was preparing for the required documentations, he was advised that there are specific agencies that he has to consult for proper negotiations, approvals, and licenses and some facts that he has to be familiar with.
  1. First, his planned business “name” Mercado Travel and Tours has to get accreditation so that it becomes an official establishment that promotes the Philippines as tourist destination.
  2. He has studied for this planned business and he is aware of the current tourism campaign of this Department. He thinks that he can make this business work as he believes in this slogan.
  3. During his trip to the main agency, he was advised to seek help from its attached agency that is responsible for marketing and promoting the Philippines as a major global tourism destination.
  This agency will teach him how to market and promote activities such as information dissemination, public relations, special events, related tourism programs and more...
  ...importantly how to market the Philippines as a major MICE destination.
  4. He plans to hire competent people who are knowledgeable, that is why he needs to go to this office or agency that develops training...
  ...modules and conduct multi skills training seminars, including continuing education programs for the industry manpower.
  5. One of the equipment that he will need is a vehicle. He has to secure a license and certificate to operate from an agency...
  ...that governs all land transport vehicles. He agreed to visit this agency that governs all land transport vehicles. He agreed to visit this agency...
  ...as soon as he gets a new vehicle.
  6. Mr. Mercado is aware that one of the functions of travel agencies is to provide assistance in securing travel documents...
  ...like passports, visas and tickets. For issuance of passports, his company needs to deal with this department that issues passports.
  7-8. For air tickets, however, he is aware that his company must sell tickets of airlines that are officially adhering to the standards...
  ...for air carriers. These carriers must be licensed by these two agencies who work in partnership with DOTC.
  9. Mr. Mercado anticipates the need to deal with other tourism suppliers, thus he would soon have to connect with accommodations for travelers.
  These establishments provide bookings for tourist on a short (overnight) or long term basis.
  10. Mr. Mercado realized that it may be tedious task to open and operate a business, but he believes that putting your heart...
  ...into it may spell success in the future, after all this business is a very promising industry.</a>

The main office of Lucky Telecompany, Inc. (LTI) is located in Parañaque City, seven to ten kilometers from the Makati business district where their contractor, PLTC is located. PLTC is one of the biggest telecommunications companies in the Philippines. LTI was awarded the fibre optic connections for the PLTC customers in Santa Rosa, Laguna for a three-year period. The fiber optic contract will require LTI to move to Santa Rosa. LTI has fifteen fibre optic technicians, five service vehicles, and fibre optic instruments and materials at their Parañaque office warehouse. Their service technicians and their families live in various districts near Parañaque and Makati, One LTI director, who worked with PLTC before retirement, lives in the Santa Rosa area. With the proposed transfer, the service technicians have requested for living quarters in the new office, to reduce their commuting time and budget. At least two senior technicians are considering resigning from LTI because of the transfer. LTI is considering a commute allowance for their service technicians instead. The human resources officer thinks that the longer commute for the service technicians may decrease productivity due to late arrivals and / or absences, especially during inclement weather and heavy traffic situations. The Parañaque office rental is higher than the proposed Santa Rosa office. However, the Santa Rosa office is on a five-year rent to own lease period. The Santa Rosa office has space for the technicians, or live-in personnel, including a warehouse and a garage area. Since the Santa Rosa office is outside of the National Capital Region, the LTI Board assumes that the food and transportation rates are lower than the Parañaque office rates. LTI bank accounts, work permits, and suppliers will need to be transferred to the Laguna area,​</a>

The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</a>

                        <p><strong>In 1991, the Philippines passed a law requiring business to take back and recycle all forms of packaging.

First, they will have additional income. Second, if the developing country is able to recycle the materials that they have collected, it can become another form of resource and may be able to establish homegrown <strong>sustainable packaging companies.</strong> For the last question, I suggest that the contract remain intact in order to finally stop the<strong> worst packaging for the environment.</strong></p><br /><br /><br />

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)  
By: Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phase out. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule.
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the driver earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes- is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and mediocre premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in may cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminal- and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in passengers of ten jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was a great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading//unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.

To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented. 10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate.

                            15. ACTIVITY 2:
IDENTIFY WHAT AGENCIES, OR IMPORTANT TOURISM-RELATED FACTS IS BEING REFERRED TO PUT A SHORT DESCRIPTION
  Mr. Arturo plans to open his own travel agency. And he was preparing for the required documentations, he was advised that there are specific agencies that he has to consult for proper negotiations, approvals, and licenses and some facts that he has to be familiar with.
  1. First, his planned business “name” Mercado Travel and Tours has to get accreditation so that it becomes an official establishment that promotes the Philippines as tourist destination.
  2. He has studied for this planned business and he is aware of the current tourism campaign of this Department. He thinks that he can make this business work as he believes in this slogan.
  3. During his trip to the main agency, he was advised to seek help from its attached agency that is responsible for marketing and promoting the Philippines as a major global tourism destination.
  This agency will teach him how to market and promote activities such as information dissemination, public relations, special events, related tourism programs and more...
  ...importantly how to market the Philippines as a major MICE destination.
  4. He plans to hire competent people who are knowledgeable, that is why he needs to go to this office or agency that develops training...
  ...modules and conduct multi skills training seminars, including continuing education programs for the industry manpower.
  5. One of the equipment that he will need is a vehicle. He has to secure a license and certificate to operate from an agency...
  ...that governs all land transport vehicles. He agreed to visit this agency that governs all land transport vehicles. He agreed to visit this agency...
  ...as soon as he gets a new vehicle.
  6. Mr. Mercado is aware that one of the functions of travel agencies is to provide assistance in securing travel documents...
  ...like passports, visas and tickets. For issuance of passports, his company needs to deal with this department that issues passports.
  7-8. For air tickets, however, he is aware that his company must sell tickets of airlines that are officially adhering to the standards...
  ...for air carriers. These carriers must be licensed by these two agencies who work in partnership with DOTC.
  9. Mr. Mercado anticipates the need to deal with other tourism suppliers, thus he would soon have to connect with accommodations for travelers.
  These establishments provide bookings for tourist on a short (overnight) or long term basis.
  10. Mr. Mercado realized that it may be tedious task to open and operate a business, but he believes that putting your heart...
  ...into it may spell success in the future, after all this business is a very promising industry.</h2><br />

                            16. Task Mechanics 1. Create a SWOT Matrix for the given situation. 2. Write your output on the Activity Sheet provided to you. The main office of Lucky Telecompany, Inc. (LTI) is located in Parañaque City, seven to ten kilometers from the Makati business district where their contractor, PLTC is located. PLTC is one of the biggest telecommunications companies in the Philippines. LTI was awarded the fibre optic connections for the PLTC customers in Santa Rosa, Laguna for a three-year period. The fiber optic contract will require LTI to move to Santa Rosa. LTI has fifteen fibre optic technicians, five service vehicles, and fibre optic instruments and materials at their Parañaque office warehouse. Their service technicians and their families live in various districts near Parañaque and Makati, One LTI director, who worked with PLTC before retirement, lives in the Santa Rosa area. With the proposed transfer, the service technicians have requested for living quarters in the new office, to reduce their commuting time and budget. At least two senior technicians are considering resigning from LTI because of the transfer. LTI is considering a commute allowance for their service technicians instead. The human resources officer thinks that the longer commute for the service technicians may decrease productivity due to late arrivals and / or absences, especially during inclement weather and heavy traffic situations. The Parañaque office rental is higher than the proposed Santa Rosa office. However, the Santa Rosa office is on a five-year rent to own lease period. The Santa Rosa office has space for the technicians, or live-in personnel, including a warehouse and a garage area. Since the Santa Rosa office is outside of the National Capital Region, the LTI Board assumes that the food and transportation rates are lower than the Parañaque office rates. LTI bank accounts, work permits, and suppliers will need to be transferred to the Laguna area,​</h2><br />

                            17. Reading and Writing Skills - Asynchronous Week - Activity 2 out of 4. Identification. Identify what Pattern of Development is used to develop the idea. Answers only. Write the answers on a one whole sheet of paper. Identify the Pattern of Development used in the thesis statements. 1. Teeth bleaching can be done in five simple steps. 2. All provincial buses should not be allowed to pass through EDSA. 3. iPhone 6 has many features that make it stand out in the market. 4. There are many reasons why unemployment continues to increase. 5. Drinking cough syrup may lead to various side effects. Identify the pattern of development in each paragraph. 6. To protect your computer from being attacked by a virus, you need to install a reliable anti-virus software. To do this, first click the "Install Now" button. After you click this button, wait for the required files to be downloaded completely. Wait for the "Welcome to the Install Shield Wizard" window to open. Then, click the "Next" button. Read and accept the license agreement and click the "Next" button. Continue to click the "Next" button until you see the "Install" button. Once it appears, click the "Install" button and wait for a few minutes as the installation is completed. Once the technical support information appears, read it and then click the "Next" button. Click the "Finish" button. The installation is complete. 7. Technological innovations can be a great help to students, but they can also be used for hi-tech cheating. The latter practice is now running rampant that it has become an epidemic: more and more students nowadays use information technology to breach rules on academic honesty without them being aware of their violations. To put a stop to this, some suggestions are listed in the succeeding sentences. First, schools can create policies banning the use of phones during examinations. They can also create programs that will develop students' information literacy skills. To ensure that plagiarism is minimized at the very least, teachers can instruct their students to subject their work to online plagiarism trackers before submitting them. 8. Traffic, traffic, traffic: this is what we always face in Metro Manila. As a solution to this problem, one government agency suggested that jeepneys be banned in the Metro. I strongly oppose this suggestion for two reasons. To start, the Philippines has not yet built an adequate and low-cost public transportation method to manage the commuters. By banning this mode of transportation, we are posing a problem to those who cannot afford expensive transport systems like taxis. Aside from this, banning jeepneys affects our cultural identity. These colorful vehicles, as well as the actual experience of riding them, have become one of the symbols of the Philippines. It is therefore a cultural crime to bar them from the country's capital. 9. In the wild, there lived three young women who decided to build a shelter. However, they had different preferences, so each of them decided to build their own house. And so it was that opposite to a river, the youngest girl built a house using leaves and twigs. Adjacent to the youngest girl's house is the shelter of the eldest. She built a house using logs and she constructed it near the spring so she can easily access drinking water. In the middle of the forest, the middle child built her house. It stands between two hills and is quite far from her two sisters' houses, but she was contented.10. There are many reasons why I prefer to live in the Metro. First and foremost, it has many exciting places. For example, you can go to Makati if you want to go shopping. If you want to experience the night life, you can visit the bars along Tomas Morato and Malate. In terms of job opportunities, the Metro houses most of the top companies that offer the best-paying jobs.​</h2><br />

JORDANIAN PLATFORM HELPS IDEAS OF YOUNG INVENTORS, INNOVATORS BECOME REALITYMY REFLECTION: 'I believe', 'I think', 'In my opinion', 'My first reaction was', 'I was especially moved by', 'The author was successful in making me feel',JORDANIAN PLATFORM HELPS IDEAS OF YOUNG INVENTORS, INNOVATORS BECOME REALITYPhilippine Daily Inquirer7 Mar 2022the age of COVID-19, Jordanian mechanical engineer Saliba Taimeh pondered how to deal with one contaminated everyday surface: the handrails of escalators in shopping malls and transport hubs.He came up with a device to sterilize them with ultraviolet rays—and this is where TechWorks stepped in.A wealth of ideas would not have seen the light of day without TechWorks, a Jordanian platform aimed at bringing together youth, ideas and resources to jump-start innovations.Set up in 2018, TechWorks says its mission is “to plug into entrepreneurial and innovation ecosystems” and turn ideas into reality.It is equipped with stateof-the-art technology such as three-dimensional (3D) printers and affiliated with a foundation set up by Crown Prince of Jordan Hussein bin Abdullah.Last year, it attracted about 100 inventors and start-up companies, enabling them to produce prototypes quickly and at low cost.Taimeh, 39, said TechWorks “provided me with every support, back up, advice and guidance” to help perfect the sterilizing device, after 23 attempts over almost two years.German investorHis invention sterilises the handrails of escalators “from all kinds of viruses, such as coronavirus and bacteria,” he said.After contacting several international companies, a German firm specializing in health and safety in public places signed up to manufacture the “Brigid Box.”Weighing in at 7.2 kilograms (almost 16 pounds), it can be installed in less than 15 minutes.Taimeh’s success story is only one of many.High school student Zain Abu Rumman, 18, has developed a tracking device for elderly patients and people with special needs, worn like a watch or around the neck.The “SPS Watch” has a battery that lasts eight days and is resistant to water, heat and breakage.“The device can send alerts to the mobile phone of a family member through a special application in case the person wearing it falls or is hurt, or if he strays from a certain place,” Abu Rumman said.It took him two-and-a-half years to perfect and he has struck a production accord with a Chinese company.Omar Khader, 26, works for “Jazri Studio,” an industrial design company which has devised a “smart” plug to protect children from electric shocks.“TechWorks has advanced equipment, engineers and technicians that help us convert our ideas into successful products,” he said.Other designers, like 32-yearold civil engineer Malik Nour, still have a long and expensive way to go to refine their products.Nour’s brainchild is the “Pikler Triangle,” designed as a safe and environmentally friendly children’s toy.He hopes to attract Swedish furniture giant IKEA to take on his products, which he is already selling over social media to customers in Jordan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates under the label of “Fares World,” named after his child..Creative environmentIsmail Hakki, executive director of TechWorks, said its aim is to provide “a creative environment and all the necessary resources to support and enable young people to transform their projects from a mere idea into a real product.”The doors of the project’s “Fabrication Lab,” or FabLab, are “open to all; we support students, entrepreneurs, and startups,” he said.FabLab also provides services to doctors and hospitals in the fields of facial restoration, digital dentistry, face masks and sterilization.At the request of a doctor, it transformed the chest x-ray of a patient with a malignant tumor close to the heart into a 3D model of the patient’s chest making it easier to operate.FabLab touts many successes, including a “smart home” which allows a mobile phone user to control electrical appliances inside the house from afar by turning on heating or cooling systems and a piano keyboard to help a blind musician play.It plans to open two more branches in Jordan to provide technology training and help for school and university students.​</h2><br />
