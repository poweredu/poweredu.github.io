It is the historian's ob to seek for the meaning of recovering the past to let the people see the continuing relevance of provenance, memory, remembering, and historical understanding for both the present and the future. y Philippine Historiography underwent several changes since the precolonial period until the present. Ancient Filipinos narrated their history through communal songs and epics that they passed orally from a generation to another. When the Spaniards came, their chroniclers started recording their observations through written accounts. The perspective of historical writing and inquiry also shifted. The Spanish colonizers narrated the history of their colony in a bipartite view. They saw the age before colonization as a dark period in the history of the islands, until they brought light through Western thought and Christianity. Early nationalists refuted this perspective and argued the tripartite view. They saw the precolonial society as a luminous age that ended with darkness when the colonizers captured their freedom. They believed that the light would come again once the colonizers were evicted from the Philippines. Filipino historian Zeus Salaza introduced the new guiding philosophy for writing and teaching history: Pantayong Pananaw (for us-from us perspective). This perspective highlights the importance Facilitating an internal conversation and discourse among Filipinos about our own history using the language that is understood by everyone. what the answer​</a>

                                            What is the lesson we can learn from this? Even though Philippines is a democracy, ours is a government composed of elites who throughout Philippine history showed that they are willing to prioritize their own interests at the expense of the Filipino people. Regardless of how their last names differ, it is important for us to understand that they are still part of the elites or what we commonly call political dynasties or the "oligarchy." Knowing the history of their existence and emergence, we should be cautious of their interests. Rather than giving our loyalty to these politicians, we should be loyal to the Filipino people. 
After learning all of this, I want you to listen to one of Gloc 9's best songs, "Upuan." How does the song explain the presence of political dynasties in the country? For 15 points, share your song analysis in 5-10 sentences.

It is the historian's ob to seek for the meaning of recovering the past to let the people see the continuing relevance of provenance, memory, remembering, and historical understanding for both the present and the future. y Philippine Historiography underwent several changes since the precolonial period until the present. Ancient Filipinos narrated their history through communal songs and epics that they passed orally from a generation to another. When the Spaniards came, their chroniclers started recording their observations through written accounts. The perspective of historical writing and inquiry also shifted. The Spanish colonizers narrated the history of their colony in a bipartite view. They saw the age before colonization as a dark period in the history of the islands, until they brought light through Western thought and Christianity. Early nationalists refuted this perspective and argued the tripartite view. They saw the precolonial society as a luminous age that ended with darkness when the colonizers captured their freedom. They believed that the light would come again once the colonizers were evicted from the Philippines. Filipino historian Zeus Salaza introduced the new guiding philosophy for writing and teaching history: Pantayong Pananaw (for us-from us perspective). This perspective highlights the importance Facilitating an internal conversation and discourse among Filipinos about our own history using the language that is understood by everyone. what the answer​</h2><br />

                            14. What is the lesson we can learn from this? Even though Philippines is a democracy, ours is a government composed of elites who throughout Philippine history showed that they are willing to prioritize their own interests at the expense of the Filipino people. Regardless of how their last names differ, it is important for us to understand that they are still part of the elites or what we commonly call political dynasties or the "oligarchy." Knowing the history of their existence and emergence, we should be cautious of their interests. Rather than giving our loyalty to these politicians, we should be loyal to the Filipino people. 
After learning all of this, I want you to listen to one of Gloc 9's best songs, "Upuan." How does the song explain the presence of political dynasties in the country? For 15 points, share your song analysis in 5-10 sentences.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Baybayin (Tagalog pronunciation: [baɪbaˈjɪn], pre-kudlit: ᜊᜊᜌᜒ, virama-krus-kudlit: ᜊᜌ᜔ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜔, virama-pamudpod: ᜊᜌ᜴ᜊᜌᜒᜈ᜴; also incorrectly known as alibata) is a Philippine script. The script is an alphasyllabary belonging to the family of the Brahmic scripts. It was widely used in Luzon and other parts of the Philippines prior to and during the 16th and 17th centuries before being supplanted by the Latin alphabet during the period of Spanish colonization. It was used in Tagalog and to a lesser extent Kapampangan speaking areas; its use spread to Ilokanos in the early 17th century. In the 19th and 20th centuries, baybayin survived and evolved into multiple forms—the Tagbanwa script of Palawan, and the Hanuno'o and Buhid scripts of Mindoro—and was used to create the constructed modern Kulitan script of the Kapampangan and the Ibalnan script of the Palawan tribe.[citation needed]</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
