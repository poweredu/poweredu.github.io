Mother shouted. But before she could finish her words, Thisbe's foot slipped and she stumbled on the hard pavement. She cried aloud. Her knees bleeding. Mother rushed to her and wiped away the blood on her knees. Then, she wiped the tears from her daughter's cheeks. "You are crying again." Mother heard. It was Thisbe's father.

                            2. did the female character speak differently from the male character in the story which is the yellow wallpaper​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Narrator</p><p>Characters The Narrator</p><p>The narrator of “The Yellow Wallpaper” is a paradox: as she loses touch with the outer world, she comes to a greater understanding of the inner reality of her life. This inner/outer split is crucial to understanding the nature of the narrator’s suffering. At every point, she is faced with relationships, objects, and situations that seem innocent and natural but that are actually quite bizarre and even oppressive. In a sense, the plot of “The Yellow Wallpaper” is the narrator’s attempt to avoid acknowledging the extent to which her external situation stifles her inner impulses. From the beginning, we see that the narrator is an imaginative, highly expressive woman. She remembers terrifying herself with imaginary nighttime monsters as a child, and she enjoys the notion that the house they have taken is haunted. Yet as part of her “cure,” her husband forbids her to exercise her imagination in any way. Both her reason and her emotions rebel at this treatment, and she turns her imagination onto seemingly neutral objects—the house and the wallpaper—in an attempt to ignore her growing frustration. Her negative feelings color her description of her surroundings, making them seem uncanny and sinister, and she becomes fixated on the wallpaper.</p><p></p><p>As the narrator sinks further into her inner fascination with the wallpaper, she becomes progressively more dissociated from her day-to-day life. This process of dissociation begins when the story does, at the very moment she decides to keep a secret diary as “a relief to her mind.” From that point, her true thoughts are hidden from the outer world, and the narrator begins to slip into a fantasy world in which the nature of “her situation” is made clear in symbolic terms. Gilman shows us this division in the narrator’s consciousness by having the narrator puzzle over effects in the world that she herself has caused. For example, the narrator doesn’t immediately understand that the yellow stains on her clothing and the long “smootch” on the wallpaper are connected. Similarly, the narrator fights the realization that the predicament of the woman in the wallpaper is a symbolic version of her own situation. At first she even disapproves of the woman’s efforts to escape and intends to “tie her up.”</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>As the narrator of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story "The Yellow Wallpaper" descends into madness, her descriptions of the wallpaper change. The color and the appearance of the wallpaper intensifies, and eventually, the wallpaper takes on a life of its own as the narrator's grip on reality loosens completely.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, that's often true. Conflict is a key element of drama because it creates tension and keeps the audience engaged. Conflict can take many forms, such as a disagreement between characters, a power struggle, or a clash of values. The conflict can also arise from external factors, such as a natural disaster or an impending deadline.</p><p></p><p>However, it's important to note that not all drama necessarily involves conflict. There are some stories where the tension and drama arise from the characters' internal struggles or their relationships with themselves. In these cases, the conflict may not be as overt, but it can still be just as powerful and engaging for the audience. Ultimately, the key to successful drama is creating characters and situations that are compelling and engaging, whether they involve conflict or not.</p><br />
