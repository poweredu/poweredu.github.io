Those who have never smoked don't know what they're missing, but former smokers, ex-smokers, reformed smokers can never forget. We are veterans of a personal war, linked by that watershed experience of ceasing to smoke and by the temptation to have just one more cigarette. *

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity.

I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</a>

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

                            6. 1. How does the speaker describe his countrymen?2. How does the speaker regard himself as a Filipino?3. If you were in his shoes, would you have the same convictions? Explain.Speech:The Filipino is worth Dying For Benigno Simeon AquinoI have spent almost eight long and lonely years in military confinement. The problem of Martial Rule and its injustices have nagged me all these years.During those eight years, I learned the true meaning of humiliation of courage, of hunger and endless anxiety. Rather than be bitter I have learned to accept my suffering as a Department of Education Republic of the Philippinescleansing process and a rare opportunity to really grapple with the problems of the Filipino.I have asked myself many times: Is the Filipino worth suffering, or even dying, for? Is he not a coward who would readily yield to any colonizer, be he foreign or home-grown? Is a Filipino more comfortable under an authoritarian leader because he does not want to be burdened with the freedom of choice? Is he unprepared or, worse, ill- suited for presidential or parliamentary democracy?I have carefully weighed the virtues and the faults of the Filipino and I have come to the conclusion that he is worth dying for because he is the nation's greatest untapped resource.He is not a coward. He values life and he tends to give his leader the maximum benefit of the doubt. Given a good leader, because he is a good follower, the Filipino can attain great heights.It would seem that he is more comfortable in being told to do than to think for himself. But this is only a superficial impression because deep down in his being, he loves freedom but puts the highest premium on human life and human dignity. Hence, he would try to adapt till his patience runs out.Is the Filipino prepared for democracy? Definitely. Even before the arrival of the Spanish Conquistador, he had already practiced participatory democracy in his barangay. He values his freedom, but because he values human life more, he will not easily take up arms and would rather wait till his patience runs outYes, I have gained valuable insights in prison and like an average Filipino, I would like to tell Mr. Marcos this:I can forgive you for what you have done to me over the last eight years because this I can do, but I can never forgive you for depriving our people of their freedom because it not mine to forgive.took away from us on that night of September 21, 1972. Like the average Filipino, please do not mistake my patience for docility, my conciliatory demeanor for cowardice and lack of will.I have chosen to suffer long years of solitary confinement rather than urge my followers to put our country to the torch because, like the average Filipino. I put the highest value on human life. And I dread the weeping of mothers whose sons will surely be sacrificed at the altar of revolution. But please do not misinterpret this conduct for timidity and subservience.I have faced death a couple of times in prison. In 1975, I went on a hunger strike for forty days and forty nights and I was near death when your jailers rushed me to the Veterans Hospital.I faced death in your detention camp when your army doctors diagnosed my heart ailment as mere muscle spasm, only to be told by doctors in the United States that I could have died from the heart attacks while I was languishing in your jail.Mr. Marcos: Please believe me when I tell you that, like the average Filipino, I will again willingly face death in a freedom struggle if you will not heed the voice of conscience and moderation.You were a soldier once, and you have repeatedly said, many times, it is an honor to die for one's country and for one's freedom.I hope you will now believe in what you preach and I pray that you shall at last desist from further trying the patience and resolve of your countrymen.Mr. Marcos: Give us back our freedom or suffer the consequences of your arrogance.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The speaker describes his countrymen as worth dying for. An untapped resource. The Filipino men are described as free from constraints but are willing to surrender if it benefits his/her land. But, if they find injustice and abuse from the system, they would not be afraid to seek justice and peace.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>2. The speaker regards himself as a Filipino who's forgiving, patient, and has good will. But most importantly, he regards himself as a Filipino who has a deep love for his country.</p><p></p><p>3. If I were to suffer and live the way the speaker has. I would show hostility rather than seek peace and forgiveness. It may make me sound bitter, but I still haven't reached the point in life where I can afford to give forgiveness to whoever has wronged me. But in the end, I applaud the speaker's action. He seeks justice not through violence, but with peace.</p><br />
