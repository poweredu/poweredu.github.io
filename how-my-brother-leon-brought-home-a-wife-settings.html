                            20. summary of how my brother leon brought home a wife</h2><br />
                        In the story, Leon arrived with his wife in the country meeting Leon's brother for the first time. They took a surprising route home for Leon, but it was meant as a test for the wife to see if she could endure the sacrifices she made and meet her new family.<br /><br />The entire story serves as a test for the wife. Each test was to show whether the woman could indeed live with strangers all for love. This can be a secondary theme, but more importantly, it is a theme in which the main character learns that though there are sacrifices it is worth it in the end.<br /><br />He even begins to think about getting himself a wife eventually. This helps to show the theme and how it developed. He notices through all the tests the woman though afraid will preserve through the trials in order to be happy with Leon at his home.<br /><br />The fact that the country is different from the city can be somewhat daunting the closer they get to the home, but she still manages to overcome and under come any trials.<br /><br />The wife admits to having some fear, but also shows clearly it did not stop her. This is why the theme is related to how one may have to give up some things in order to find happiness in life or at least the best happiness that can be found in that particular life. The trials just add to the picture being offered by the author.<br /><br /><br /><br />

                        <p> </p><p></p><p> Anewer :Character: These are the actors that appear in the fiction. Leon appears to be the fist character in the fiction. Maria is Leon's wife. Baldo is Leon's younger brother. Leons parents are also part of the character used in the Fiction</p><p>The plot. The plot is the sequence of events that occurs in the fiction. Leon brings his city-girl wife, Maria, home for the first time to meet his parents in the fiction. Maria's suitability is put to the test several times by Leon's younger brother Baldo, who is easily won over by her papaya blossom perfume.</p><p>The Setting. the story's setting is the location where it takes place. The setting is both in Pasay City and the town of Itogon, Benguet.</p><p>Point-of-view. The author tells the story first person I. For instance, "I have always enjoyed teaching the Arguilla story for its subversive take on the role that one’s family plays in a marriage; but having been born and raised in Pasay City, I had no idea what papaya blossoms smelled like" (Cruz).</p><p>Style: The fiction is started with the cross-reference of Manuel Arguilla’s ‘How my brother brought home a wife’. It is also narrative and descriptive. Narrating the story of marriage and family.</p><p>Theme: The main theme is marriage family and wedding. There is also bits of love as a theme. Jhoanna Lynn Cruz's marriage is chronicled in this moving account. It reveals how the displacement of culture and society influenced her decisions, personality, and identity as a woman.</p><p>Literary Devices: Example used is symbolism. The writer continues to write with so much symbolism while going through the many painful, complicated events in a marriage. In the end, she continues to have faith, offer forgiveness, and ask for forgiveness despite her ups and downs. Her story was truly inspirational and deserving of attention. This encourages me to believe that no matter how much suffering we've endured, there is always hope and that we must persevere in the end.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Explanation:Thx Me Later</p><br />
