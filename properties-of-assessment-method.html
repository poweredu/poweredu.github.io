                            11. IV. ASSESSMENT Direction: Answer the following questions. 1. Refers to the degree to which on instrument accurately measures what it intends to measure. Three common types of validity for researchers and evaluators to consider are content, construct, and criterion validities. 2. Research instrument that consists of a set of questions or other types of prompts that aims to collect information from a respondent. 3. Validity that indicates the extent to which items adequately measure or represent the content of the property or trait that the researcher wishes to measure. 4. It is also called experimentation, is research conducted using a scientific approach using two or more variables. 5. It measures the correlation between scores from one administration of an instrument to another, usually wilhin an interval of 2 to 3 weeks 6. Il is a way to gather data by watching people, events, or noting physical characteristics in their natural setting. 7. It is a tool used to obtain, measure, and analyze data from subjects around the research topic. 8. It involves an interviewer, who coordinates the process of the conversation and asks questions, and an interviewee, who responds to those questions. 9. It refers to the degree to which an instrument yields consistent results, Common measures of reliability include Internal consistency, test-retest, and inter-rater reliabilities. 10. Validity that indicates the extent to which a measurement method accurately represents a construct (e.g..o latent variable or phenomena that can't be measured directly, such as a person's attitude or belief) and produces an observation distinct from that which is produced by a measure of another construct..​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>1. VALIDITY<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p><strong>Validity</strong> is the primary degree to which an idea, end or estimation is all around established and reasonable compares precisely to this present reality. "Legitimate" is gotten from the Latin validus, which means solid. The <strong>validity </strong>of an estimation apparatus is how much the instrument estimates what it professes to quantify. <strong>Validity </strong>depends on the strength of an assortment of various kinds of proof portrayed more meticulously beneath.
</p><p> In psychometrics, validity has a specific application known as test <strong>validity</strong>: "how much proof and hypothesis support the translations of grades.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Validity</strong> is for the most part acknowledged that the idea of logical validity tends to the idea of reality as far as factual measures and as such is an epistemological and philosophical issue just as an issue of estimation. The utilization of the term in rationale is smaller, connecting with the connection between the premises and finish of a contention. In rationale, <strong>validity </strong>alludes to the property of a contention by which in the event that the premises are valid then the reality of the end follows by need.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Validity in research refers to#asap - Brainly.ph
