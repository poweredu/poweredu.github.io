                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>i think it means "The people who want to and are living by the Lord's righteousness will be blessed, and they will be satisfied."</p><p><strong>Explanation: there are no wrong answers for how you describe this (well except for the nonsense ones)</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount begins with the Beatitudes, a list of blessings that describe the inner character of those who are true servants of God and the kingdom of heaven. This teaching was part of Jesus Christ’s intensive discipleship training for His twelve chosen apostles. The fourth Beatitude states, “Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled” (Matthew 5:6).  The Beatitudes offer solid truths for living as a disciple of Christ. While each Beatitude can stand on its own, they aren’t merely a collection of unrelated statements. They are linked in an unbroken chain, each one building on the previous truth. The first several Beatitudes deal with the condition of the heart; the second set pertains to our relationship with the Lord; the final grouping treats our relationships with others.  Jesus always begins with the heart. When He pronounced a blessing on those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, He touched on the inner state of our hearts.  Drawing from Old Testament passages that describe the downtrodden and oppressed (Psalm 10:17–18; 74:21; 109:22; 140:12; Proverbs 15:15 Job 5:17; Isaiah 30:18), Jesus used language and concepts in the Beatitudes that were familiar to His audience (Psalm 1:1; 34:8; 65:4; 128:1; Proverbs 14:21). Those listening were living under the oppressive rule of the Roman Empire. They were experiencing excessive taxation, denied freedoms, and persecution. The servants of God’s kingdom desperately needed the heavenly perspective and hope of an eternal inheritance that Christ presented in the Beatitudes.  The word blessed in the Beatitudes signifies deep, joy-filled contentment and an inner state of spiritual well-being. To hunger and thirst for righteousness is to possess an active spiritual longing: “My soul thirsts for God, for the living God. When can I go and meet with God?” (Psalm 42:2; see also Psalm 63:1; 143:6; Amos 8:11). This desire is not passive; it is a fervent seeking. The servant who hungers and thirsts for righteousness is the same as the one who seeks God’s kingdom and His righteousness before and above everything else (Matthew 6:33). This servant is blessed because he or she experiences a satisfied heart. This servant can say, “It is well with my soul.”
Righteousness speaks of right relationship with God and with other people. The idea of right relationships with others forms the link in the chain to the next section of the Beatitudes, while right standing with God is His gift of salvation given through faith in Jesus Christ to those who believe in Him (Romans 3:22).  Luke’s rendering of the fourth Beatitude holds only the notion of hunger: “Blessed are you who hunger now, for you will be satisfied” (Luke 6:21). But Matthew’s report intensifies the desire for righteousness with the addition of thirst. Those who thirst for righteousness receive the water Jesus offered to the woman at the well: “But those who drink the water I give will never be thirsty again. It becomes a fresh, bubbling spring within them, giving them eternal life” (John 4:14, NLT). The term filled or satisfied in the Beatitude means that the pangs of hunger and thirst will disappear. The verb is passive, indicating that God Himself will fulfill our intense desire for right relationship with Him. Salvation is His gift. We can’t earn it (Ephesians 2:8).  In summary, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they will be filled could be paraphrased as follows: “Deeply joyful and spiritually whole are those who actively seek right relationship with God and, in so doing, discover that He alone can completely save and satisfy their souls.”</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Explain the relevance of the parable of the pharisee and the yax collector to the beatitude "blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The “poor in spirit” are those who cast themselves on God's grace.[1] We personally acknowledge our spiritual bankruptcy before God. It is the tax collector in the temple, beating his breast and saying, “God, be merciful to me, a sinner” (Luke 18:9-14). It is an honest confession that we are sinful and utterly without moral virtues needed to please God. It is the opposite of arrogance. In its deepest form, it acknowledges our desperate need for God. Jesus is declaring that it is a blessing to recognize our need to be filled by God’s grace.</p><p></p><p>Thus, at the very beginning of the Sermon on the Mount, we learn that we don’t have the spiritual resources in ourselves to put Jesus’ teachings into practice. We can't fulfill God’s call by ourselves. Blessed are those who realize they are spiritually bankrupt, for this realization turns them to God, without whom they cannot fulfill what they are created to do and be. Much of the rest of the sermon rips away from us the self-delusion that we are capable of acquiring a state of blessedness on our own. It aims to produce in us a genuine poverty of spirit.</p><p></p><p>What is the practical result of this blessing? If we are poor in spirit, we are able to bring an honest appraisal of ourselves to our work. We don't inflate our résumé or boast about our position. We know how difficult it is to work with people who cannot learn, grow, or accept correction because they are trying to maintain an inflated picture of themselves. So we commit ourselves to honesty about ourselves. We remember that even Jesus, when he started working with wood, must have needed guidance and instruction. At the same time, we acknowledge that only with God at work within us can we put Jesus’ teachings into practice on the job. We seek God’s presence and strength in our lives each day as we live as Christians where we work.</p><br />

                            20. Why are those persecuted for righteousness' sake considered "blessed"?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>'Blessed Are Those Who Are Persecuted for Righteousness’ Sake” (Matt 5:10)</p><p>Bible Commentary / Produced by TOW Project</p><p></p><p>The eighth and final beatitude may strike us as negative. Up to this point, the beatitudes have focused on humility, meekness, right relationships, mercy, purity of heart, and peacemaking—all positive qualities. But Jesus includes the possibility of “persecution for righteousness’ sake.” This arises from the previous seven, because the forces that oppose God’s ways still hold great power in the world.</p><p></p><p>Note that persecution arising from unrighteous behavior is not blessed. If we fail through our own fault, we should expect to suffer negative consequences. Jesus is talking about the blessing of being persecuted for doing right. But why would we be persecuted for righteousness? The reality in a fallen world is that if we demonstrate genuine righteousness, many will reject us. Jesus elaborates by pointing out that the prophets, who like him announced God’s kingdom, were persecuted. “Blessed are you when people revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who were before you” (Matt. 5:11-12). Righteous people in the workplace may be subjected to active, even severe persecution by people who benefit—or believe they benefit—from injustice there. For example, if you speak up for—or merely befriend—people who are victims of gossip or discrimination in your workplace, expect persecution. If you are the president of a trade association, and you speak out against an unfair subsidy your members are receiving, don’t expect them to re-elect you. The blessing is that active persecution for the right reasons indicates that the powers of darkness believe you are succeeding in furthering God's kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Even the best organizations and most admirable people are still tainted by the Fall. None are perfect. The eighth beatitude serves as a reminder to us that working in a fallen world requires courage.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        Answer<p>Hunger and Thirst is a natural mechanism of warning or indicating that our body needs to satisfy its nutrition requirements. It also a way for the body to tell that it has cravings. So, we naturally make it a priority to seek food to eat and beverages for drinking to satisfy the want or need to eat. </p><p>The same can be said for seeking Justice and Righteousness. The two are both a "want" and "need" that we all want to feel satisfied with. So, we have the desire diligently seek Justice and Righteousness.</p><p></p><p><strong>The Habit of Saving in Cooperatives - </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/10665031</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />
