OHS or Occupational Health and Safety refers to the legislation, policies,
procedures and activities that aim to protect the health, safety and welfare of all
people at the workplace.
Below are some of the safety practices that we should consider while working with
any electrical and electronic device, including personal computers and its
peripherals.
1. Do not work alone so that there’s someone who can take care of you in case
of emergency.
2. Always power off the computer and unplug the computer before working on
it.
3. Take away any liquid near your working area to avoid getting electrocuted
or accidentally damaging computer parts.
4. Be careful with tools that may cause short circuit.
5. Always ground or discharge yourself before touching any parts of the
computer.
15
6. Do not use excessive force if things don’t quite slip into place.
7. Clean the area before and after using it to maintain sanitation and prevent
accidents.
8. Hold the components on the edges and do not touch the INTEGRATED
CIRCUITS(IC) parts.
9. Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) in accordance with the
organization’s OHS procedures and practices.
10. Make sure that the pins are properly aligned when connecting a cable
connector.
11. Contingency measures during workplace accidents, fire and other
emergencies are recognized.
12. Use brush, compressed air or blower in cleaning the computer system.</a>

1. Do not work alone so that there’s someone who can take care of you in case
of emergency.
2. Always power off the computer and unplug the computer before working on
it.
3. Take away any liquid near your working area to avoid getting electrocuted
or accidentally damaging computer parts.
4. Be careful with tools that may cause short circuit.
5. Always ground or discharge yourself before touching any parts of the
computer.

7. Clean the area before and after using it to maintain sanitation and prevent
accidents.
8. Hold the components on the edges and do not touch the INTEGRATED
CIRCUITS(IC) parts.
9. Always wear personal protective equipment (PPE) in accordance with the
organization’s OHS procedures and practices.
10. Make sure that the pins are properly aligned when connecting a cable
connector.

                            17. why every computer laboratory needs safety measure and protocols when working​</h2><br />
                        <p>Answer:This guidance is to address the general workflow safety concerns of laboratory personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic. All laboratories should perform site- and activity-specific risk assessments to determine the most appropriate safety measures to implement for particular circumstances. In addition, facilities should adhere to local policies and procedures as well as all applicable federal, state, and local regulations and public health guidelines.</p><p></p><p>Risk assessments should include the following considerations:</p><p></p><p>Analyze the number of people that the laboratory space can realistically and safely accommodate while maintaining social distancing.</p><p>Assess the flow of personnel traffic. Where possible, design one-way paths for staff to walk through the laboratory space.</p><p>Assess procedures for cleaning and sanitizing commonly shared equipment and areas—for example, counters, benchtops, and desks—to ensure clean surfaces and equipment for all users.</p><p>Review emergency communication and operational plans, including how to protect staff at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19.</p><p>Every institution should have a COVID-19 health and safety plan to protect employees. This plan should be shared with all staff. Ideally, this plan would:</p><p></p><p>Describe steps to help prevent the spread of COVID-19 if an employee is sick.</p><p>Instruct sick employees to stay home and not return to work until the criteria to discontinue home isolation are met, in consultation with healthcare providers and state and local health departments.</p><p>Provide information on whom employees should contact if they become sick.</p><p>Implement flexible sick leave and supportive policies and practices. If sick leave is not offered to some or all employees, the institution should consider implementing emergency sick leave policies.</p><p>Designate someone to be responsible for responding to employees’ COVID-19 concerns. Employees should know who this person is and how to contact this person at all times.</p><p>Provide employees with accurate information about COVID-19, how it spreads, and the risk of exposure.</p><p>Reinforce training on proper handwashing practices and other routine infection control precautions to help prevent the spread of many diseases, including COVID-19.</p><p>Ensure that employees have access to personal protective equipment (PPE); disinfectant products that meet EPA’s criteria for use against SARS-CoV-2external icon; and soap, clean running water, and drying materials for handwashing, or alcohol-based hand sanitizers that contain at least 60% ethanol or 70% isopropanol.</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />
