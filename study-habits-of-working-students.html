                                            168 Chapter 2 Solving Equations and Inequalities Example 3 Finding the Dimensions of Room A rectangular family room is twice as long as it is wide, and its perimeter is 84 feet. Find the dimensions of the family room. Solution For this problem, it helps to draw a diagram, as shown in Figure 2.2. 2. Length + 2 Width Perimeter Verbal Model: Labels: Perimeter = 84 Width = w Length = / = 2w Equation: 2(2w) + 2w = 84 6w = 84 w = 14 Original equation Combine like terms. Divide each side by 6. Because the length is twice the width, you have 1 = 2w = 2(14) = 28. Length is twice width. Substitute 14 for w. Simplify. So, the dimensions of the room are 14 feet by 28 feet. ✔CHECKPOINT Now try Exercise 59. (feet) (feet) (feet) Figure 2.2 The figure provided with Example 3 is not really essential to the solution. Nevertheless, strongly encourage your students to develop the habit of including sketches with their solutions even if they are not required. STUDY TIP Students sometimes say that although a solution looks easy when it is worked out in class, they don't see where to begin when solving a problem alone.

Inyour notebook, copy the article below and underline the biased statements.andarK-Pop and Its Positive Influences on TeenagerseMest students assume that the music they like only influences their style. They wear clothes inspired by popular SouthKorean fashion. They get inspired for hair and makeup, too.Music relaxes people. One of the main benefits of listening to K-pop music while studying is that it acts as a stressreliever. K Pop music is often misunderstood as superficial. It's not. It's an emotional outlet, just like any other music that youwould recanmend to a student to listen. But when you get deeper into K-Pop music, you'll realize that it can be inspiring, too.Many tunes inspire students to work hard to achieve their dreams. Just take a look at the lyrics of 'Breakthrough' by Twice. Whena student struggles to write papers or study for the exams, that particular song can have an uplifting effect.KPop stars may be focused on their appearance. However, we cannot deny that they have to work hard to achieve thelifestyle that they lead. They practice for hours every day. They stay consistent with their healthy eating and exercise habits, andthey have great focus and determination,There are teens who become obsessed with K-Pop music. They imitate their favorite stars. They want to be thin and fit asthem. Such obsession can lead to eating disorders and depression. However, we can talk about the same extremes when wediscuss any other popular genre. When we take our attention away from the extremes, we'll realize that music, regardless of itsgenre, is beneficial for students. It helps them bond with their friends. It's a stress-relieving hobby, and students can benefit fromit.https://essentiallypop.com/epop/2020/03/impact-of-k-pop-music-on-academic-performance/​</a>

Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

Find the dimensions of the family room. Solution For this problem, it helps to draw a diagram, as shown in Figure 2.2. 2. Length + 2 Width Perimeter Verbal Model: Labels: Perimeter = 84 Width = w Length = / = 2w Equation: 2(2w) + 2w = 84 6w = 84 w = 14 Original equation Combine like terms. Divide each side by 6. Because the length is twice the width, you have 1 = 2w = 2(14) = 28. Length is twice width. Substitute 14 for w. Simplify. So, the dimensions of the room are 14 feet by 28 feet. ✔CHECKPOINT Now try Exercise 59. (feet) (feet) (feet) Figure 2.2 The figure provided with Example 3 is not really essential to the solution.

Inyour notebook, copy the article below and underline the biased statements.andarK-Pop and Its Positive Influences on TeenagerseMest students assume that the music they like only influences their style. They wear clothes inspired by popular SouthKorean fashion. They get inspired for hair and makeup, too.Music relaxes people. One of the main benefits of listening to K-pop music while studying is that it acts as a stressreliever. K Pop music is often misunderstood as superficial. It's not. It's an emotional outlet, just like any other music that youwould recanmend to a student to listen. But when you get deeper into K-Pop music, you'll realize that it can be inspiring, too.Many tunes inspire students to work hard to achieve their dreams. Just take a look at the lyrics of 'Breakthrough' by Twice. Whena student struggles to write papers or study for the exams, that particular song can have an uplifting effect.KPop stars may be focused on their appearance. However, we cannot deny that they have to work hard to achieve thelifestyle that they lead. They practice for hours every day. They stay consistent with their healthy eating and exercise habits, andthey have great focus and determination,There are teens who become obsessed with K-Pop music. They imitate their favorite stars. They want to be thin and fit asthem. Such obsession can lead to eating disorders and depression. However, we can talk about the same extremes when wediscuss any other popular genre. When we take our attention away from the extremes, we'll realize that music, regardless of itsgenre, is beneficial for students. It helps them bond with their friends. It's a stress-relieving hobby, and students can benefit fromit.https://essentiallypop.com/epop/2020/03/impact-of-k-pop-music-on-academic-performance/​</h2><br />

                            24. Grade &amp; A. Read and understand the argumentative essay below. As you read, label its different parts.          Cheating is not the answer The life of a student can be very stressful. Students wake up very early in the morning to go to class and sleep very late at night just to finish schoolwork. There are so many assignments to do, projects to accomplish, and tests to pass. That is why many students resort to the bad act of cheating. Cheating in school comes in many forms. Some students cheat in a small way. secretly glancing at their notes during a test. Others do it in a massive scale like copying an entire essay from the net and claiming it as an original work. Whatever its form may be, cheating is definitely wrong and will never be the right thing for a student to do. Here are some reasons why. Cheating is a bad act that can develop into a bad habit with the passing of time. According to an article from Grown and Flown, an internet site made specially for parents, cheating at school is a habit that can be brought by a child into adulthood. Bad habits produced by cheating too often at school can be carried on at work resulting to employees who are also lazy and cheaters at the workplace. Cheating can also lead to serious punishments. In some schools in the United States, students caught cheating automatically gets a fail for the subject or may even be expelled. In China, students caught cheating during an entrance exam may even be imprisoned for seven years! In the Philippines, punishment for cheating is not as severe as in the other countries, still it has negative effects on a student's standing in class. Worse, it can create mistrust and sour the relationship between teachers and students. Moreover, cheating is a form of self-deception. While it may eppear that cheaters fool other people and oftentimes gets unpunished, at the end, cheaters only fool themselves. The act of cheating creates a false idea of achievement. Would you rather work hard for your grades or simply copy just to pass? Cheating is bad. It is an act that can grow into an unstoppable habit and can cause serious damage to a student's academics and relationships with school officials. The worse, it is a form of self-deception. Therefore, cheating must always be avoided by students. Rather than cheat, learn how to balance one's own time between studying and relaxing to be a more productive, honest, and good student. Surround yourself with peers who are good influence when it comes to studying and can help you in your studies without pushing you to cheat or be insincere. Lastly, learn when to ask for help and assistance: if a lesson is hard, the solution is not to cheat. Ask help from your teachers, friends, and family members. B. After labeling the parts, answer the following questions: 1. What is the topic of the essay? 2. What is the writer's stand about cheating in school?3. What reasons were given by the writer for his stand about cheating in schools?  4. After reading the essay, do you agree or disagree with the writer's opinion about the issue? Were you convinced?

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>TOPIC : STUDY HABITS OF A JUNIOR STUDENT.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>As a junior high school student, I have encountered some problems when it comes to distance learning. One of the main problems is distractions. When I'm studying, my phone keeps buzzing, and my siblings or parents keep talking to me. It's hard to concentrate, and I tend to get sidetracked easily. Another issue is the lack of motivation. Sometimes, I don't feel like studying, and I procrastinate until it's too late.</p><p></p><p>The problems that I have in distance learning are caused by the environment around me. Since I'm at home, there are a lot of things that distract me. My siblings are also studying from home, so it can get noisy and chaotic at times. It's also hard to maintain a routine since I don't have a strict schedule like in school.</p><p></p><p>To overcome these problems, I have come up with some solutions. First, I try to create a conducive environment for studying. I make sure that I'm in a quiet room, and I turn off my phone or put it on silent mode. I also try to study during hours when my siblings are not too busy with their online classes. Second, I try to motivate myself by setting goals and rewards. For example, if I finish studying for two hours straight, I reward myself with a snack or a short break.</p><p></p><p>My study habits involve a balance between studying and other activities. I make sure that I have enough time for my hobbies and interests, so I don't get burnt out. I also try to take breaks in between study sessions to rest my mind and recharge. When it comes to understanding topics, I read the materials thoroughly and take down notes. If there's something that I don't understand, I search for more information online or ask my teacher during our online class.</p><p></p><p>To prove that my study habits are effective, I would show my grades and how I was able to cope with the challenges of distance learning. I would also share my tips and tricks with my classmates and encourage them to try it out for themselves. Ultimately, the best way to prove that my study habits work is by consistently performing well in school and achieving my goals.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
