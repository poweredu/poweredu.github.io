                                            Create a campaign of advocacy poster on the proper use of psychoactive substance. Summary There are many reasons in everything we do. In the life of every individual there are five aspects that influence an individual's action. Drug abuse is around the corners and the following risk factors will lead the individual especially the adolescents who are vulnerable to drug abuse. Each of the five aspects of a person's life may be the trigger point where the risk factors may come from. Risk factors should not be a problem because there are protective factors that can strengthen the weakness of each individual. You should understand every individual personality and make the right choice in every decision and action. Psychoactive substances are classified into five, namely: stimulant, depressant, opioids, and hallucinogens. Psychoactive means it changes the person's mental state. This group of psychoactive drugs is dangerous if not properly used.​</a>
