As mentioned earlier, the new video games that arecoming out are extremely complex and they involve the movement of many different kinds ofsticks and buttons on the controllers. These can be very good for children as they learn to makethe fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. Thisallows them to think quickly and improves their reflexes. The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and accurate movements for the children to control thecharacters. This helps in making the children much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives.Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addictedto playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from theirother responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities.Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens thanplaying real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many healthrelated problems for children, as they can get obese if they don't exercise ad stay home playingvideo games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children.Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they areurging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video gamesconsuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actuallyget up and move.Many researchers have talk about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how itaffects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actuallyparticipating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allowchildren to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, andcommit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on thechildren as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it isalrighi. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven ordisproven as of yet.We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as wellas negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving theirreflexes. The cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as theirbecoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educatorstakeup this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children todivide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies andother responsibilities.- (Source: www.tailoredessays.com/samples/video-games-affect-children-essay.htm)1.

                                            I NEED THIS ASAP PLEASUsing Emotional Appeals to Reach CustomersParents fret about their teenager driving the car for the first time alone. Subaru of America taps into this emotional moment in a television commercial called “Baby Driver.” The commercial shows a father leaning into the passenger side window to give driving instructions to what appears to be his 6-year-old daughter, who is sitting behind the wheel. After giving his safety talk, the father hands the car keys to his daughter, who now appears to be 16 years old. To add to the realism, Subaru chose a real father and his two daughters as the actors in the commercial. As is the case with many fathers, this one still sees his older daughter as his “little girl.” “We knew this day was coming, that’s why we bought a Subaru,” says the father.The advertisement highlights two of the top reasons why people buy Subarus-high safety and reliability ratings. Safety is one of Subaru’s core brand values, but the company chose not to drill viewers with a list of its top ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Instead, Subaru created an ad that tugs at the heartstrings of parents. Many parents can identify with this commercial because they someday will be handing over the car keys to their son or daughter for the first time. In the ad, Subaru also emphasizes that many owners pass down their Subarus to their children because they are so highly dependable. The Subaru commercial is based upon the theme that Subaru owners have “Like-Minded” values.”The Commercial also addresses teen and distracted driving issues, which are frequent topics in the news. Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among 15 to 20 years old, and 16 years old have higher crash rates than drivers of any age. Parents have a real reason to be concerned. The Subaru advertisement attempts to get parents thinking about the importance of selecting vehicle that can increase teens’ safety while driving.Subaru’s message seems to be working. Its sales increased 30 percent compared to previous year’s sales. If an advertiser can appeal to the consumers’ emotions, it may make a connection that leads to sales.WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES IN THIS. GIVE AT LEAST 5-7 SENTENCES EACH.​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Advantages of a historic vehicle</p><p></p><p>- In many locations you do not have to pay road tax for historic vehicles</p><p>- They have to go through MOT (vehicule inspection) less often: every two years if they're between 30 and 40 years old, three years if you are between 40 and 45 years old and four years if over 45 years.</p><p>- The vehicule inspections are less complete depending on the type of vehicle being inspected. They can normally be exempted from emissions testing or suspension</p><p>- Insurance is cheaper</p><p></p><p> Disadvantages of a historic vehicle</p><p></p><p>- The DGT may limit the circulation of a historic vehicle. For example, it may restrict the dates or lanes on which it may travel, if the vehicle cannot exceed 80 km/h. They may also prohibit driving at night or in poor visibility conditions, if it does not have an adequate lighting system. In addition, if you cannot exceed 60 km/h you may not be allowed to drive on the motorway or expressway. If you cannot exceed 40 km/h you must always drive on the hard shoulder or as close to the right as possible if there is no hard shoulder.</p><p>- Insurance companies usually impose a limit of 5,000 km per year</p><p>- The procedures to convert it into a classic vehicle cost about 600 euros.</p><p>- The State could request the car for exhibitions if it has a relevant historical value.</p><br />

                        <p>Mobile phone use while driving is common but it is widely considered dangerous due to its potential for causing distracted driving and crashes. Due to the number of crashes that are related to conducting calls on a phone and texting while driving, some jurisdictions have made the use of calling on a phone while driving illegal. Many jurisdictions have enacted laws to ban handheld mobile phone use. Nevertheless, many jurisdictions allow use of a hands-free device. Driving while using a hands-free device is not safer than using a handheld phone to conduct calls, as concluded by case-crossover studies,[1][2] epidemiological,[3][4] simulation,[5] and meta-analysis.[6][7] In some cases restrictions are directed only at minors, those who are newly qualified license holders (of any age), or to drivers in school zones. In addition to voice calling, activities such as texting while driving, web browsing, playing video games, or phone use in general can also increase the risk of a crash.
</p><p>
</p><p>In the United States, automobile crashes due to distracted driving are increasing. The leading cause of distracted driving is cell phones.[citation needed]
</p><p>
</p><p>In 2015, six hundred and sixty thousand drivers in the United States were estimated to use cell phones each day, while driving behind the wheel during daylight hours. Cell phone use while driving has become a leading cause of vehicle crashes over the last two decades.[citation needed] Using a cell phone while driving increases the driver's risk of causing a crash. Drivers are distracted, decreasing the driver's awareness on the road, leading to more car crashes. When drivers talk on cell phones the risk of an automobile crash resulting in hospitalization is four times higher than when not talking on a cell phone.[8] Drivers who text when behind the wheel, are twenty-three times more likely to have an automobile crash.[9] One out of every four automobile crashes in the United States are caused by texting while driving.[10] Some states have implemented laws in regards to using cell phones while driving.</p><br />

                            23. increasing hand eye coordination and increasing dexterity mental skills; a decrease interest inother interest such as studies and sports; and a very negative effect of inducing violence.One of the most positive effects of video games is increasing the dexterity of a child andimproving his or her hand eye coordination. As mentioned earlier, the new video games that arecoming out are extremely complex and they involve the movement of many different kinds ofsticks and buttons on the controllers. These can be very good for children as they learn to makethe fast connections between what they see and what their hands and fingers are doing. Thisallows them to think quickly and improves their reflexes. The newest games are very precision-based and it takes very minute and accurate movements for the children to control thecharacters. This helps in making the children much more a depth at handling and operating real-life machinery and objectives.Another effect that playing video games have on children is that they tend to get addictedto playing this games and give them foremost priority. This takes the children away from theirother responsibilities, such as doing house chores, homework, and other physical activities.Children also end at spending more time playing video games in front of television screens thanplaying real and actual sports that involve physical exercise. This in turn can have many healthrelated problems for children, as they can get obese if they don't exercise ad stay home playingvideo games. This is perhaps the worst negative effect that video games can have on children.Parents and educators all over the world are concern about this phenomenon and they areurging the children to not spend so much time playing video games. Many new video gamesconsuls, such as the new Nintendo WII have come out with games that require users to actuallyget up and move.Many researchers have talk about the effects of viewing violence in the media and how itaffects children. Video games takes this to another level, where the children are actuallyparticipating in being violent in the video games. There are many games out there that allowchildren to play arm bearing characters who can kill anyone that they want, steal cars, andcommit many different kinds of crime. These games can have negative implications on thechildren as they get immune to the idea of committing crime and end up believing that it isalrighi. Research still on going on this negative effect and it has not entirely been proven ordisproven as of yet.We find that plain video games can have various effects on children, both positive as wellas negative. Even though children can benefit by increasing their dexterity and improving theirreflexes. The cost of them losing out on their physical exercise and homework, as well as theirbecoming prone to violent acts, are way too much. It is important that the parents and educatorstakeup this problem seriously and enable certain rules and regulations that allow children todivide their time responsively between playing video games and completing their studies andother responsibilities.- (Source: www.tailoredessays.com/samples/video-games-affect-children-essay.htm)1.

                            30. I NEED THIS ASAP PLEASUsing Emotional Appeals to Reach CustomersParents fret about their teenager driving the car for the first time alone. Subaru of America taps into this emotional moment in a television commercial called “Baby Driver.” The commercial shows a father leaning into the passenger side window to give driving instructions to what appears to be his 6-year-old daughter, who is sitting behind the wheel. After giving his safety talk, the father hands the car keys to his daughter, who now appears to be 16 years old. To add to the realism, Subaru chose a real father and his two daughters as the actors in the commercial. As is the case with many fathers, this one still sees his older daughter as his “little girl.” “We knew this day was coming, that’s why we bought a Subaru,” says the father.The advertisement highlights two of the top reasons why people buy Subarus-high safety and reliability ratings. Safety is one of Subaru’s core brand values, but the company chose not to drill viewers with a list of its top ratings from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration or the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. Instead, Subaru created an ad that tugs at the heartstrings of parents. Many parents can identify with this commercial because they someday will be handing over the car keys to their son or daughter for the first time. In the ad, Subaru also emphasizes that many owners pass down their Subarus to their children because they are so highly dependable. The Subaru commercial is based upon the theme that Subaru owners have “Like-Minded” values.”The Commercial also addresses teen and distracted driving issues, which are frequent topics in the news. Motor vehicle accidents are the leading cause of death among 15 to 20 years old, and 16 years old have higher crash rates than drivers of any age. Parents have a real reason to be concerned. The Subaru advertisement attempts to get parents thinking about the importance of selecting vehicle that can increase teens’ safety while driving.Subaru’s message seems to be working. Its sales increased 30 percent compared to previous year’s sales. If an advertiser can appeal to the consumers’ emotions, it may make a connection that leads to sales.WHAT IS THE ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES IN THIS. GIVE AT LEAST 5-7 SENTENCES EACH.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The advantage of using emotional appeals to reach customers is that it can be effective in creating a connection with the audience and making a lasting impression on them. By tapping into the emotions of the audience, a company can create a sense of relatability and resonance that can persuade them to buy the product or service. In the case of the Subaru commercial, the company was able to appeal to the emotions of parents by showing a realistic portrayal of a father handing over the car keys to his daughter for the first time. This creates a sense of identification for parents who can relate to this experience, and it highlights the safety and reliability of the Subaru brand, which are key factors for many parents when choosing a car for their teenager.</p><p></p><p>Another advantage of using emotional appeals is that it can help to differentiate the company and its products from competitors. By creating an emotional connection with the audience, the company can stand out in a crowded marketplace and create a sense of loyalty among its customers. This can be especially important for companies that sell products that are seen as similar to those of their competitors, as it can help to establish a unique selling proposition and build a strong brand identity.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also some potential disadvantages to using emotional appeals to reach customers. One disadvantage is that it can be difficult to predict how the audience will respond to the appeal. Some people may be moved by the emotional appeal, while others may be resistant to it or even turned off by it. This can make it hard for companies to gauge the effectiveness of their emotional appeals and to determine whether they are reaching their target audience effectively.</p><p></p><p>Another disadvantage of using emotional appeals is that it can be seen as manipulative or insincere if not done correctly. If the company does not genuinely care about the issues it is highlighting or does not have a strong track record of addressing those issues, the emotional appeal may come across as contrived or insincere, which can damage the company's reputation and credibility.</p><p></p><p>Finally, emotional appeals can be expensive to create and may require significant resources to produce and disseminate. This can be a disadvantage for companies with limited budgets or resources, as it can be difficult to compete with larger companies that have the resources to produce high-quality emotional appeals.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
