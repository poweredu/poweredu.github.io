I could still hear my father play music using theturntable And as the time goes by, nobody under eighteen years old wouldask about, well those next to it like tape recorders, compact disk or CD.Your expressions date you. For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words. I just can't imagine how a divan looks like when one of the supervisors told us to have one inside the room for our cleaning materials. I should have understood it only if she said sofa.Read a short story and answer the following questions; 1. What type of connection is used in the story you have read? 2.

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words. I just can't imagine how a divan looks like when one of the supervisors told us to have one inside the room for our cleaning materials. I should have understood it only if she said sofa.Read a short story and answer the following questions; 1. What type of connection is used in the story you have read? 2.

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.
