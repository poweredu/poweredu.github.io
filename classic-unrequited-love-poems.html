                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>10 of the Best Poems about Unrequited Love</p><p> interestingliterature</p><p>4 years ago</p><p>The best poems about pining away for love selected by Dr Oliver Tearle</p><p></p><p>‘Love’ and ‘poetry’ go together to form a natural pair, but as Shakespeare pointed out, the course of true love never did run smooth. Sometimes the greatest lovers are those who pine away, hopelessly devoted to someone who will never return their affections. From the medieval courtly love tradition onwards, poets have been treating the subject of unrequited love. Here are ten of the best poems about love that is not reciprocated…</p><p>Sir Philip Sidney, ‘With how sad steps, O moon, thou climb’st the skies’.</p><p></p><p>With how sad steps, O moon, thou climb’st the skies;</p><p>How silently, and with how wan a face.</p><p>What, may it be that even in heavenly place</p><p>That busy archer his sharp arrows tries?</p><p>Sure, if that long-with-love-acquainted eyes</p><p>Can judge of love, thou feel’st a lover’s case;</p><p>I read it in thy looks; thy languished grace</p><p>To me, that feel the like, thy state descries …</p><p></p><p>This poem, Sonnet 31 from Sidney’s sonnet sequence Astrophil and Stella, is a great Elizabethan poem about hopeless love (Stella, the object of Astrophil’s affections, is married to another man), although the sonnet appears to teeter on the edge of self-parody.</p><p></p><p>William Shakespeare, Sonnet 87.</p><p></p><p>Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,</p><p>And like enough thou know’st thy estimate,</p><p>The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;</p><p>My bonds in thee are all determinate.</p><p>For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?</p><p>And for that riches where is my deserving?</p><p>The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,</p><p>And so my patent back again is swerving …</p><p></p><p>This is probably Shakespeare’s greatest poem about unrequited love – and we think it qualifies as an ‘unrequited love poem’ because, although the poet and the Fair Youth appear to have been in a relationship of sorts, with the younger man reciprocating the Bard’s affections, it’s clear Shakespeare feels that the Fair Youth is out of his league and doesn’t really love the poet the way he loves him.</p><p></p><p>John Clare, ‘The Secret’.</p><p></p><p>I loved thee, though I told thee not,</p><p>Right earlily and long,</p><p>Thou wert my joy in every spot,</p><p>My theme in every song …</p><p></p><p>This poem by an often-overlooked voice in Romantic poetry, John Clare (1793-1864), strikes to the heart of what many of us have felt at some time in our lives: having kept his love of somebody a secret, the poet is doomed to transfer or deflect that love onto other people who remind him of his first, true love. Not so much a lost love as a love never had, this one – but poignant and affecting nevertheless.</p><p></p><p></p>How wonderful life would be<br />If only you love me<br />I am willing to risk everything <br />Just for you to feel something<br />That something I'm hoping<br />Is for you, my love, <br />To love me back <br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We can not get to know another person or develop a loving relationship with that individual unless we spend time with that person. To say that you love someone, but never visit, engage in conversation with or spend time with that person would be to live a lie and deceive yourself.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            17. The Jollibee commercials that aired early this year have touched the hearts of many Filipinos. What is the common theme of these commercials?
Select one:
a. Unconditional love
b. Unrequited love
c. Familial love
d. Mutual love</h2><br />
                        Jollibee Commercial Theme
<p>
</p><p><strong>Answer:
</strong></p><p>
</p><p>For me, the answer is <strong>A. UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.</strong> The commercials released throughout the previous years and current years all showed the love other people have for their family, wife, husband, friends, etc. Unconditional love includes familial love, mutual love, and unrequited love. For example, they had a commercial series during valentines showing that the man loved a woman but she liked someone else. Despite this, the man still loved the woman dearly and supported her all the time.  </p><p>
</p><p>During the previous years, the Jollibee commercials mostly focused on the familial love and bond between the members of the family. They never failed to touch the hearts of the Filipinos.  </p><p>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My reflection on unrequited love is that it can be a difficult situation to be in. Whether it's the person not feeling the same way or putting an emotional barrier between you, unrequited love can stir up a range of feelings. While it can be disappointing, it's important to remember that you are still loved and valued even if the person that you have feelings for does not feel the same. It's important to respect the boundaries of the other person and focus on taking care of yourself and your own feelings.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>lord Randall tells the tale of a man whose heart was broken by his lover, who also poisoned him. The ballad is written in a dialogue form through which Lord Randall is conversing with his mother. The poem is easy to remember because it is written in slant rhyme and incremental repetition. While "Barbara Allan", is Tragic love. As John is dying Barbara Allan disregards his death, and he wishes her a happy life without him while confessing his love on his death bed. Then after he dies Barbara Allan decides to commit suicide thus making it a cliché tragic love story.</p><br />
