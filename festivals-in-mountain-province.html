Contrary to some articles, Teresa is actually a valley surrounded by mountains. The town center is located almost at the center of the valley. In an aerial view of Teresa, one would notice the previously vast expanse of agricultural land bordered by marble-rich Mountains. The town is passed by motorists bounded for the more inland towns of Morong, Baras, Tanay, Pililla, and Laguna and Quezon provinces. Land uses (in hectares): Commercial (1.92), Residential (104.32), Agricultural (1183.35), Protected areas (13,952.41), Industrial / Ecozone (710.69), Institutional (112.28), and Special / Other uses (123.03). The town's festivals are the Turumba sa Mahal na Patron Santa Rosa (held every August 23), Anniversary celebration of town independence (every December 30), and Town fiesta (every 1st Sunday of March) known as "AMARA Festival." Amara Festival is the official festival of the Municipality of Teresa in Honor of the Patroness Saint Rose of Lima. The celebration of the feast is called “AMARA Fesitval”. AMARA is the acronyms from the word Adobe, MARmol and Apog which is the natural resources of Teresa.</a>

The term is of Kankanaey origin, meaning "season of blooming".[1] The festival, held in February, was created as a tribute to the city's flowers and as a way to rise up from the devastation of the 1990 Luzon earthquake.[2] The festival includes floats that are covered mostly with flowers not unlike those used in Pasadena's Rose Parade. The festival also includes street dancing, presented by dancers clad in flower-inspired costumes, that is inspired by the Bendian, an Ibaloi dance of celebration that came from the Cordilleras.</p><p></p><p>The Bases Conversion Development Authority (BCDA), in collaboration with the John Hay Poro Point Development Corporation's (JPDC)[3] annual Camp John Hay Art Contest, gave its official logo from one of the entries: a spray of indigenous sunflowers from an artwork submitted by Trisha Tabangin, a student of the Baguio City National High School. The festival was set in February to boost tourism as it was considered as a time of inactivity between the busy days of Christmas season and the Holy Week and the summer season.[4]</p><p></p><p>On 1996, archivist and curator Ike Picpican suggested that the festival be renamed as Panagbenga, a Kankanaey term that means "a season of blossoming, a time for flowering".</p><p>In February 2020, the festival was initially postponed due to the threat of COVID-19, it was later then cancelled in March 2020.[5][6]</p><p>The festival was later cancelled again in 2021, citing the severity of the Pandemic in the city. The funds on both cancelled events were diverted to the health situation.</p><p></p><br />
