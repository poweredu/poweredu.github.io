                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Process writing is a way of breaking down the task of writing into its smaller component parts. By completing each step sequentially, writing becomes a less threatening and less daunting task. Students learn that writing doesn’t just happen; it is planned and it evolves, taking shape as it develops. The steps in process writing can be divided into two major phases: the prewriting phase and the writing phase. Both are necessary to the writing process and are interdependent. Prewriting is needed to organize, sequence, and elaborate on ideas prior to writing. The writing phase turns this organization of ideas into a composition.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pashen sha na po ha</p><p>yan lang maitutu long ko </p><p><strong>PE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>BWEDE</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PA</strong><strong> </strong><strong>BRAIN</strong><strong> </strong><strong>LEST</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PLZ</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PLZ</strong><strong> </strong><strong>PLZ</strong></p><br />
