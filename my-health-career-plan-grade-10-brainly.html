                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong>PLANNING FOR A HEALTH CAREER</strong><p>HEALTH CAREER plan designed to familiarize students with the various careers in the medical profession and allied health services. It involves continuous learning and improvement to build and grow in the chosen career path.</p><p></p><p>Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions you will make in life. It's about so much more than deciding what you will do to make a living. To start with, think about the amount of time we spend at work. Many people don't put enough effort into choosing occupations or pick them for the wrong reasons.</p><p></p><p>Besides offering security and stability in life having a good career is also very important due to following reasons: Nothing gives more joy than a healthy bank balance at the start of month. Financial health paves way a secure and comfortable lifestyle. Money does make many troubles go away.</p>SELF ASSESSMENT<p>Self assessment revolves around the thoughtful consideration, reflection, and evaluation of your interests, personality characteristics, values, and skills through a variety of methods, such as the use of a whole host of career-related tools and instruments. This stage seeks to uncover and confirm what makes you tick, what drives, what are your top priorities, and so forth.</p><p></p>TAKING ACTION<p>This stage is about being proactive with your career plans and being confident enough to begin following through with what you’ve decided. Taking action is one of those things that’s easier said than done. It’s a stage where having a mentor and/or a solid support system is especially important.</p><p></p>EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH<p>The career planning component consisting of exploration and research is all about being in information gathering mode. This is the time to explore, collect, and organize all available (and pursue not-so-available) resources to eventually begin analyzing them to see what top career-related options (e.g., college major, occupation, career path, etc.) starting rising to the top of the list. </p><p></p>DECISION MAKING<p>The decision-making step of the career planning process is when you analyze and reflect on all the pieces of information about yourself and your carefully collected career options together as best as possible, all in order to generate realistic short-term and long-term career-related goals and the steps to reach them. </p><p></p>EVALUATION<p>After you have made your career-related decision(s) and identified your goals and the steps to achieve them, keep in mind that many of the folks who achieve career success are the ones who continually evaluate and assess their status. In fact, they keep track of their career progress throughout their lifetime, making adjustments and taking calculated risks throughout their career journey. #BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p></p>Having a realistic career plan in place is often an essential part of career growth, and our personal growth and development.

It involves continuous learning and improvement to build and grow in the chosen career path.</p><p></p><p>Choosing a career is one of the most important decisions you will make in life. It's about so much more than deciding what you will do to make a living. To start with, think about the amount of time we spend at work. Many people don't put enough effort into choosing occupations or pick them for the wrong reasons.</p><p></p><p>Besides offering security and stability in life having a good career is also very important due to following reasons: Nothing gives more joy than a healthy bank balance at the start of month. Financial health paves way a secure and comfortable lifestyle. Money does make many troubles go away.</p>SELF ASSESSMENT<p>Self assessment revolves around the thoughtful consideration, reflection, and evaluation of your interests, personality characteristics, values, and skills through a variety of methods, such as the use of a whole host of career-related tools and instruments. This stage seeks to uncover and confirm what makes you tick, what drives, what are your top priorities, and so forth.</p><p></p>TAKING ACTION<p>This stage is about being proactive with your career plans and being confident enough to begin following through with what you’ve decided. Taking action is one of those things that’s easier said than done. It’s a stage where having a mentor and/or a solid support system is especially important.</p><p></p>EXPLORATION AND RESEARCH<p>The career planning component consisting of exploration and research is all about being in information gathering mode. This is the time to explore, collect, and organize all available (and pursue not-so-available) resources to eventually begin analyzing them to see what top career-related options (e.g., college major, occupation, career path, etc.) starting rising to the top of the list. </p><p></p>DECISION MAKING<p>The decision-making step of the career planning process is when you analyze and reflect on all the pieces of information about yourself and your carefully collected career options together as best as possible, all in order to generate realistic short-term and long-term career-related goals and the steps to reach them. </p><p></p>EVALUATION<p>After you have made your career-related decision(s) and identified your goals and the steps to achieve them, keep in mind that many of the folks who achieve career success are the ones who continually evaluate and assess their status. In fact, they keep track of their career progress throughout their lifetime, making adjustments and taking calculated risks throughout their career journey. #BrainlyFast</p><p></p><p></p><p>To read and learn more about this topic, you may click on these following links: </p>HEALTH CAREER PATHWAYS : https://brainly.ph/question/2580998IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH CAREER : https://brainly.ph/question/2564711<p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p><strong>Health </strong><strong>Career plan Essay</strong><p></p><p>Growing up I always knew that I wanted to work with children, from that stemmed my first career choice of becoming a Pediatrician. As I began my career planning in High school the realization of how long it would take to become a doctor discouraged me. I once again changed my career goals to becoming a teacher, and then finally to a nurse who could assist with the delivery of babies. Making the right choice was important to me and that explains the ever changing career decisions. After doing some research I decided that a nurse midwife was along the lines of where I want to be. Completing this the personal career development plan will not only help me see my goals on paper but will give me something to look back on when I have acquired all the goals I set to accomplish.</p><br />
