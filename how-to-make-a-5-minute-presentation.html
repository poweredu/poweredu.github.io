UVC light is blocked by Earth's atmosphere, But UVA rays and some UVB rays reach Earth's surface.One recent  study tested whether UVB rays could effect the Novel coronavirus. in order to control the environment, the study team simulated sunlight with a lamp that emitted only UVB Rays and exposed surfaces to the lamp's light. the simulated sunlight destroyed the novel coronavirus in less 20 minutes.More  studies are needed to confirm this result, and unlike in the study, the amount of UVB light That reaches earth's surface is not constant---regardless of how quickly UVB rays may affect the coronavirus, it is important to note that the study looked at the effect on surfaces, not on people. UV radiation, which most often comes from the sun is dangerous to people because it damage s skin cells, exposure to UV radiation in the main factor in developing skin cancerin other words, exposing your skin to the sun's UV Rays could destroy any coronavirus present, but it will damage The DNA in your skin's cell. over time, the effects of that damage build up and make cells more likely to develop skin cancer.QUESTIONS:1. what is the article about?2. who are being referred to in the article?3. where is the area of a person's body part that is being watched out for4. why we should not expose ourselves to too much sunlight?5. how are we going to take care of ourselves from damaging effects of the sun and of the threatening effects covid- 19?​</a>

How to Purify Cloudy Water Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. You will need a boiling pot, fire, salt, a coffee filter or cloth, , charcoal, and cotton. First, prefilter the cloudy water with a cotton filter or folded cloth. Then, boil the filtered water. Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of water as it is boiling. If you are above 2000 feet altitude, boil for three minutes. Next, let the water cool. Meanwhile, make a cotton and charcoal filter by crushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as trap. This will remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiled water. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cotton trap. 1. What is the text about? 2.

                            25. SUNLIGHT MAY DESTROY THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS,BUT IT ALSO DAMAGE SKIN AND CAN HAVE CANCER.there are three types of UV Rays Emitted by the sun---UVA, UVB, and UVC. UVC light is blocked by Earth's atmosphere, But UVA rays and some UVB rays reach Earth's surface.One recent  study tested whether UVB rays could effect the Novel coronavirus. in order to control the environment, the study team simulated sunlight with a lamp that emitted only UVB Rays and exposed surfaces to the lamp's light. the simulated sunlight destroyed the novel coronavirus in less 20 minutes.More  studies are needed to confirm this result, and unlike in the study, the amount of UVB light That reaches earth's surface is not constant---regardless of how quickly UVB rays may affect the coronavirus, it is important to note that the study looked at the effect on surfaces, not on people. UV radiation, which most often comes from the sun is dangerous to people because it damage s skin cells, exposure to UV radiation in the main factor in developing skin cancerin other words, exposing your skin to the sun's UV Rays could destroy any coronavirus present, but it will damage The DNA in your skin's cell. over time, the effects of that damage build up and make cells more likely to develop skin cancer.QUESTIONS:1. what is the article about?2. who are being referred to in the article?3. where is the area of a person's body part that is being watched out for4. why we should not expose ourselves to too much sunlight?5. how are we going to take care of ourselves from damaging effects of the sun and of the threatening effects covid- 19?​</h2><br />

The area of a person's body part that is being watched out for is the skin.</p><p></p><p>4  We should not expose ourselves to too much sunlight because UV radiation can damage skin cells and increase the risk of developing skin cancer. While sunlight may destroy the novel coronavirus, it is important to protect our skin from the harmful effects of UV radiation.</p><p></p><p>5. To protect ourselves from the damaging effects of the sun and the threatening effects of COVID-19, we can take several measures. These include wearing protective clothing, such as long-sleeved shirts and hats, using sunscreen with a high SPF, avoiding direct sunlight during peak hours, and practicing social distancing, wearing masks, and following other guidelines to prevent the spread of COVID-19.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

How to Purify Cloudy Water Boiling is perhaps the safest way to purify cloudy water. You will need a boiling pot, fire, salt, a coffee filter or cloth, , charcoal, and cotton. First, prefilter the cloudy water with a cotton filter or folded cloth. Then, boil the filtered water. Add a small amount of salt to improve the taste of water as it is boiling. If you are above 2000 feet altitude, boil for three minutes. Next, let the water cool. Meanwhile, make a cotton and charcoal filter by crushing the charcoal and putting it in the cotton as trap. This will remove impurities and still some bad taste from the boiled water. Finally, filter the boiled water through the cotton trap. 1. What is the text about? 2.
