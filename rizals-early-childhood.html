</p><p>  </p><p><strong>José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda</strong> He was born on June 19, 1861, some 35 years before that fateful day. The seventh of the eleven children born to a comparatively well-to-do family in the Dominican lands of Calamba, Laguna, Jose Rizal lived and died in the Philippines during the Spanish colonial era.  </p><p><strong>Jose's father, Francisco Mercado Rizal</strong>, was a prosperous farmer from Binan, Laguna, while his mother, Teodora Alonzo y Quintos, was an accomplished and highly educated woman from Sta. Cruz, Manila.
</p><p>In his early childhood, Jose had perfected the alphabet, learnt to write and read books like the Spanish translation of the Vulgate Bible. At a young age, he had always shown a tendency towards the arts. His family was fascinated by his pencil paintings, sketches, and clay moldings. Later in his youth, he displayed a special talent in painting and drawing, wrote a Tagalog play, which was presented at the Calamba Festival, and penned a short Spanish play, which was presented at the school.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>He went to Spain on 3 May 1882 and enrolled at the Universidad Central de Madrid.</strong> He obtained a degree in medicine in June 1884 at the age of 23. A year back, he finished his course of Philosophy and Letters with the rank of "excellent." Wanting to treat his mother's advanced blindness, Rizal went to Paris, Heidelberg, and Berlin to gain more experience and expertise in ophthalmology. He finished his eye specialization in Heidelberg.  </p><p>Well-traveled, he is said to have mastered 22 languages. He wrote remarkable poetry, contributed nationalist essays to magazines, maintained his diary religiously, and corresponded to his friends and relatives. In March 1887, in Berlin, he published his first controversial book, Noli Me Tangere, which exposed the injustice and greed of the Spanish clergy and officials in the Philippines. To prove that the Filipinos had an outstanding culture long before the Spanish occupation, Morga's Successos De Las Islas Filipinas was annotated and reprinted in Paris. On September 18, 1891, Rizal's more militant book, El Filibusterismo, was published in Ghent.
</p><p>In 1896, Rizal was granted permission by the governor general to become a volunteer military physician for the war in Cuba, which at the time still raged from yellow fever. But the 'Katipunan' launched the Philippine Revolution on August 26, 1896. T<strong>he influential people who were provoked by Rizal's hostility used the opportunity to include him in the revolt. He was guilty of revolt and sentenced to death by firing squad at Bagumbayan Field after a trial in the Kangaroo court (now Luneta).</strong>
