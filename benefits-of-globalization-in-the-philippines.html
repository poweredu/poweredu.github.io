MANILA, Philippines — About P10.2 billion from the Philippine Health Insurance Corp.’s (PhilHealth) budget was “potentially lost” to fraudulent transactions and schemes in 2019. 
This loss could balloon to P18 billion by next year if not addressed properly, PhilHealth president Ricardo Morales revealed on Tuesday during a Senate inquiry on the alleged corruption in the agency. Morales, citing a study in December last year, said the state insurer’s fraud index rate was at 7.5%, while the global average is at 10% to 20%. “In other words, of the 176 billion spent by PhilHealth last year of benefit payments, P10.2 billion was potentially lost to fraud,” he said. “Next year, if the right thing is not done, of the P240 billion planned benefit expenditure, this potential loss could balloon to P18 billion,” the PhilHealth president added. The “systematic” fraud plaguing the agency will only be stemmed by a “robust, integrated, and harmonized information management system” that could run a membership database, Morales claimed. He added that the current information management system of PhilHealth is “fragmented, aging and overextended ministered by overworked IT professionals.” However, the IT project of PhilHealth, which is supposedly designed to stop fraud and scams within the agency, was flagged as “overpriced” by government auditors.</a>

MANILA, Philippines — About P10.2 billion from the Philippine Health Insurance Corp.’s (PhilHealth) budget was “potentially lost” to fraudulent transactions and schemes in 2019. 
This loss could balloon to P18 billion by next year if not addressed properly, PhilHealth president Ricardo Morales revealed on Tuesday during a Senate inquiry on the alleged corruption in the agency. Morales, citing a study in December last year, said the state insurer’s fraud index rate was at 7.5%, while the global average is at 10% to 20%. “In other words, of the 176 billion spent by PhilHealth last year of benefit payments, P10.2 billion was potentially lost to fraud,” he said. “Next year, if the right thing is not done, of the P240 billion planned benefit expenditure, this potential loss could balloon to P18 billion,” the PhilHealth president added. The “systematic” fraud plaguing the agency will only be stemmed by a “robust, integrated, and harmonized information management system” that could run a membership database, Morales claimed. He added that the current information management system of PhilHealth is “fragmented, aging and overextended ministered by overworked IT professionals.” However, the IT project of PhilHealth, which is supposedly designed to stop fraud and scams within the agency, was flagged as “overpriced” by government auditors.</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>Global warming is a word that practically everyone has heard of. However, the majority of us are still unsure of what it means. As a result, global warming refers to a steady increase in the overall temperature of the Earth's atmosphere. There are a variety of things going on that are steadily raising the temperature. Our ice glaciers are fast disappearing due to global warming. </p><p></p><p>Global warming has evolved into a serious issue that requires our full attention. It is occurring due to a combination of factors rather than a single cause. These factors are both natural and man-made. The emission of greenhouse gases that are unable to escape from the planet, causing the temperature to rise, is one of the natural causes. Further, volcanic eruptions are also responsible for global warming. That is to say, these eruptions release tons of carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming. Similarly, methane is also one big issue responsible for global warming.</p><p></p><p>Global warming can be stopped when combined efforts are put in. For that, individuals and governments, both have to take steps towards achieving it. We must begin with the reduction of greenhouse gas, they need to monitor the consumption of gasoline. Switch to a hybrid car and reduce the release of carbon dioxide. </p><p></p><p>All of us must realize the fact that our earth is not well. It needs to treatment and we can help it heal. The present generation must take up the responsibility of stopping global warming in order to prevent the suffering of future generations. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The most common cause of migration for Filipinos is economic opportunity. This could be due to the prevalence of poverty in the Philippines and the need to find better opportunities abroad.</p><p></p><p>2. Labor and migration contribute to globalization by making it possible for people to move to different countries and grow their skills, talents, and resources. This helps to create a more diverse and globalized workforce that is able to contribute to the economy of different countries.</p><p></p><p>3. The home country benefits from migrant workers by having a pool of remittances from the members of the diaspora. These remittances can be used to help improve the economy of the home country.</p><p></p><p>4. Push factors refer to the motivations to leave a certain place, such as poverty, unemployment, conflict, or political instability. Pull factors refer to the motivations to move to a certain place, such as better economic opportunities, higher wages, or a better quality of life. An example of a push factor could be Filipinos moving to another country due to high levels of poverty, while an example of a pull factor could be the availability of higher wages and better employment opportunities.</p><p></p><p>5. The Philippines' recognition as a top contributor to the population of migrant workers can have both positive and negative impacts on our country. On the one hand, it is a source of pride and recognition for the country, and it can also bring in economic benefits in the form of remittances. On the other hand,</p><br />
