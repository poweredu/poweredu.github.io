                        <strong>Excerpt from Kaffir Boy</strong><p>The text titled Excerpt from Kaffir boy mostly focuses on the importance of <strong>education </strong>to a child who only knows the simple things in life.
</p><p>The story started with a conversation between a son and his mother. He asked his mother why would she want him to go to school?, his mother replied because she didn’t want him to end up the same as his father.
</p><p>Illiterate and ignorant of the new ways in the new world, where education best fits everyone to make a living and get a job. He continues to question his mother’s thinking but it immediately fades away as his mother gave him reasons that will not just change his mind but also change his way of thinking about education.
</p><p><strong>His mother described education as:
</strong> </p>A key to open a new world for him
It will one soar above the clouds
It will free him from poverty
He will be able to embrace the good and discard the bad
It will make him a proud person
<p>His mother continued, that even though his father is indeed his husband and part of his family. His mind was set to be ignorant and still abide the old ways of their tribe just his father before him. He refused his own son to get education because it was unnecessary and it will only be a thing that the white people might and will take away from them.
</p><p>His mother also wanted to go to school but educating a woman is much deemed unnecessary than from a man. She believed that if his son can go to school then maybe someday she can go to even though she may be old by then.
</p><p>Importance of <strong>Education</strong>:
</p>Education is a treasure to a person that no one can take back
It is a tool to get better living
It is important for someone to get a better job

                        <strong>Kaffir Boy</strong><p>The boy’s initial attitude in the Excerpt from Kaffir Boy about going to <strong>school </strong>is an opposing one.  </p><p>At first the boy was dead set on not going to school for it doesn’t have a good point in his mind. He imagines school as some place where people can be criticized. He then tells his mother the same but his mother still pushes him to go to school but not in a forceful way of saying.
</p><p>His mother persuaded him by providing explanations why she wants him to go to <strong>school</strong> and learn. Their father was also opposed on him going to school as he finds it unnecessary and only a mere thing to take. His father was born and raised in a tribe by his father to just focus and forever value their old beliefs and practices.
</p><p>But his mother had given him a change of mind she said that:
</p>She wants him to learn to be free
She wants him to get a proper job and live in prosperity
She wanted him to not be like his father who is ignorant
<p>By these he might just give confidence to his mother and maybe someday let her educate herself too, because his mother also dreamed of going to school and being able to find a proper living than her current status. But sadly, it was against their tribe’s laws to give freedom to women to have education.

                            11. Marxist approach essay about except from kaffir boy​</h2><br />
                        In "Kaffir Boy," an autobiography by Mark Mathabane, the author recounts his childhood and teenage years growing up in apartheid-era South Africa. The excerpt chosen for this Marxist analysis is the chapter where Mathabane describes his father's experience as a mine worker and the harsh working conditions he faced. Using a Marxist lens, this essay will analyze the excerpt in terms of class struggle, exploitation, and alienation.<br /><br />At the heart of Marxism is the concept of class struggle, which refers to the ongoing conflict between the ruling class (capitalists) and the working class (proletariat). In the excerpt, Mathabane's father is a prime example of the exploited working class. He is a migrant laborer who travels to Johannesburg to work in the mines, leaving his family behind in the impoverished black township of Alexandra. He works long hours in dangerous conditions, with little pay or benefits. He is forced to live in cramped and unsanitary hostels provided by the mining companies, where he has little privacy and is subject to harsh treatment by the white supervisors. This reflects the Marxist idea that the working class is exploited by the ruling class for their labor power.<br /><br />Furthermore, the excerpt highlights the theme of alienation, a central concept in Marxist theory. Alienation refers to the estrangement of the worker from the product of their labor, from the work itself, from other workers, and from themselves. Mathabane's father experiences this on many levels. He is forced to perform back-breaking labor that provides no sense of fulfillment or satisfaction. He is separated from his family for extended periods of time, which creates a sense of isolation and loneliness. He is treated as a disposable commodity by the mining companies, with no regard for his physical or emotional well-being. All of these factors contribute to his overall sense of alienation.<br /><br />The Marxist perspective also emphasizes the importance of economic and social equality. The apartheid system in South Africa, which was designed to maintain white supremacy and subjugate the black majority, exemplifies the Marxist idea that capitalism perpetuates inequality and oppression. The excerpt illustrates how the mining companies exploited black workers, providing them with inadequate wages and living conditions while making huge profits. This perpetuated the economic and social inequality that was inherent in the apartheid system.<br /><br />In conclusion, the excerpt from "Kaffir Boy" provides a powerful example of the Marxist themes of class struggle, exploitation, and alienation. Mathabane's father, as a black mine worker, is a prime example of the exploited and oppressed working class. The mining companies, as representatives of the ruling class, perpetuate economic and social inequality by exploiting the labor of black workers. This excerpt serves as a reminder of the ongoing struggle for economic and social justice, which remains a crucial goal in contemporary society.<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Marxist approach focuses on analyzing the relationships and power dynamics between social classes. In Mark Mathabane's "Kaffir Boy," a memoir about his experiences growing up in apartheid-era South Africa, Marxist analysis can provide insight into the economic and social structures that perpetuated inequality.</p><p></p><p>In an excerpt from the book, Mathabane describes his father's work as a gardener for a white family. He writes, "My father's daily routine was fixed and unvarying. He would leave home before dawn and return after dark, looking haggard and drained from his grueling work."</p><p></p><p>This passage highlights the exploitation of black labor under apartheid. Mathabane's father works long hours for low pay, while his employers, who are white, benefit from his labor. This is a clear example of the unequal power dynamic between the ruling white class and the oppressed black class.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Mathabane describes how his father's work is physically exhausting, emphasizing the exploitation of black bodies. This is a common theme in Marxist analysis, which sees the exploitation of labor as not only an economic issue, but also a physical one. Black workers in apartheid South Africa were not only underpaid, but also forced to endure difficult and dangerous working conditions.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the economic exploitation of black labor, the passage also highlights the social marginalization of black South Africans. Mathabane's father is referred to as a "Kaffir," a derogatory term used by white South Africans to refer to black people. This demonstrates how black people were dehumanized and excluded from mainstream society, further reinforcing their position as a marginalized class.</p><p></p><p>Overall, Marxist analysis provides a lens through which to view the economic and social structures that perpetuated inequality in apartheid South Africa. Through an examination of Mathabane's experience, we can see how the exploitation of black labor and the marginalization of black people were interrelated issues that reinforced each other.</p><br />
