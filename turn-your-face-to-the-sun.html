                                            "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2. How does this passage from plato help you turn your attention toward the right thing (i.e. truth, beauty, justice &amp; goodness? )3. Give the interpretations and meaning of each symbols in relation to real life?​Help po please!</a>

                                            Activity: In 1. Read the passage from “Plato's Allegory of the Cave" (Critical thinking, Communication, Character) "Some prisoners are chained inside a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see and hear are shadows passing back and forth and the echoes bouncing off the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside the cave. He is blinded by the light, confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see clearly the things around him, and even the sun itself. He came to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others-only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness). He tried to free the other prisoners but they violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and they even tried to kill him) (https://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/allegory) 2.

                                            The group of prisoners has been living there in chains since their birth. They have never seen the outside          world, only shadows of it. They have no knowledge of anything beyond their miserable lives in the cave. The prisoners are chained facing a wall and can’t turn their heads. There’s a fire behind them which produces some light.  Occasionally people pass by th at fire with animals and objects or figures that are cast in the wall, and the prisoners can see their shadows. All that the prisoners know are those shadows. They name them and believe they are real entities. They talk about the shadows with enthusiasm an         d are fascinated by them, thinking that if you pay attention, you can succeed in life. One day, a prisoner manages to free himself from the chains and step outside the cave to see the outer world. At first, the sun burns his eyes, but then they adjust, and    he finds everything so colorful, exciting, full of life. He sees the real forms of the things he knew as shadows, like rabbits, birds, flowers,  people, objects, he even sees the sky and stars. “Previously, he had been looking only at phantoms; now, he is nearer to the true nature of being.”  – Plato People explain to him that everything he sees is real, and the shadows are just mere reflections. Although he cannot understand this at first, he then adjusts and sees how the sun is  responsible for light and producing the shadows. The prisoner gets back to the cave and tells everyone what he had just witnessed, but no one believes him. His eyes had adjusted to the sun, and now he can’t see the shadows  clearly as he did before. They tell him he’s crazy, and violently resist while he tries to free them.

                                            1.	Read the passage from “Plato’s Allegory of the Cave”(Critical thinking, Communication, Character)“Some prisoners are chained inside a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see and hear are shadows passing back and forth and the echoes bouncing off the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside the cave. He is blinded by the light, confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see clearly the things around him, and even the sun itself. He came to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness). He tried to free the other prisoners but they violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and they even tried to kill him)”.(https://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/allegory)2.

                            5. "Plato's Allegory of the Cave"Some prisoners are chained inside of a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see (and hear) are shadows passing back and forth (and the echoes bouncing off of) the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside of the cave. He is blinded by the light, and confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see the things around him, and even the sun itself. He comes to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others—only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness) and violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and even try to kill him).Question:1. What are the objects, symbols use in the plato's allegory of the cave?2.

                            12. Activity: In 1. Read the passage from “Plato's Allegory of the Cave" (Critical thinking, Communication, Character) "Some prisoners are chained inside a cave, facing the back wall. Behind them is a fire, with people passing in front of it. The prisoners cannot turn their heads, and have always been chained this way. All they can see and hear are shadows passing back and forth and the echoes bouncing off the wall in front of them. One day, a prisoner is freed, and dragged outside the cave. He is blinded by the light, confused, and resists being led outside. But, eventually his eyes adjusts so that he able to see clearly the things around him, and even the sun itself. He came to realize that the things he thought were real were merely shadows of real things, and that life outside of the cave is far better than his previous life in chains. He pities those still inside. He ventures back into the cave to share his discovery with the others-only to be ridiculed because he can hardly see (his eyes have trouble at first re-adjusting to the darkness). He tried to free the other prisoners but they violently resisted (the other prisoners refuse to be freed and led outside, and they even tried to kill him) (https://wmpeople.wm.edu/asset/index/cvance/allegory) 2. What does this story mean? 3. How does this passage from Plato lielp you turn your attention toward the right thing (ie, truth, beauty, justice and goodness)? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>2. This story shows us that people have a very limited perspective of the world. The men inside the cave did not know anything else since they had <strong>never been exposed to the outside world before</strong>. For them, reality existed only there. However, one of the them had the chance to explore the world outside of that cave and <strong>realized how little they actually knew</strong>.</p><p>It is hard to convince people who do not acknowledge that there are things they do not know. The free man was correct, but the others mocked him instead. They refused to even consider it since they were already used to their way of life. On top of that, he could no longer see the dark cave in the same way. Once you gain knowledge, <strong>people who do not understand will be hard to convince.</strong></p><p><strong>3. </strong>This passage has shown me that we should focus on doing the right thing no matter what. Even though other people will not always believe you, it is <strong>our resposibility to seek truth, justice, goodness, and beauty</strong>. After all, it expands our horizons and our possibilities. The story has also shown me that we should not keep ourselves trapped in our own echo chambers and always look beyond what we know.</p><p>#BRAINLYFAST </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This answer offers another interpretation of the Allegory of the Cave by Plato: https://brainly.ph/question/3195417</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The portion of the moon that we can see from Earth on any given night is called the moon’s phase. As the moon orbits around the Earth, sunlight is reflected off the moon’s surface and that light reaches us on Earth. The phase of the moon depends on where the moon is in its orbit. It takes about one month for the moon to make a full orbit around the Earth, meaning the phases of the moon repeat about once a month</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            21. The group of prisoners has been living there in chains since their birth. They have never seen the outside          world, only shadows of it. They have no knowledge of anything beyond their miserable lives in the cave. The prisoners are chained facing a wall and can’t turn their heads. There’s a fire behind them which produces some light.  Occasionally people pass by th at fire with animals and objects or figures that are cast in the wall, and the prisoners can see their shadows. All that the prisoners know are those shadows. They name them and believe they are real entities. They talk about the shadows with enthusiasm an         d are fascinated by them, thinking that if you pay attention, you can succeed in life. One day, a prisoner manages to free himself from the chains and step outside the cave to see the outer world. At first, the sun burns his eyes, but then they adjust, and    he finds everything so colorful, exciting, full of life. He sees the real forms of the things he knew as shadows, like rabbits, birds, flowers,  people, objects, he even sees the sky and stars. “Previously, he had been looking only at phantoms; now, he is nearer to the true nature of being.”  – Plato People explain to him that everything he sees is real, and the shadows are just mere reflections. Although he cannot understand this at first, he then adjusts and sees how the sun is  responsible for light and producing the shadows. The prisoner gets back to the cave and tells everyone what he had just witnessed, but no one believes him. His eyes had adjusted to the sun, and now he can’t see the shadows  clearly as he did before. They tell him he’s crazy, and violently resist while he tries to free them.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" is a concept devised by the philosopher to ruminate on the nature of belief versus knowledge. The allegory states that there exists prisoners chained together in a cave. ... The prisoners watch these shadows, believing them to be real. Plato posits that one prisoner could become free</p><p></p><p>Who are the prisoners in the cave? The prisoners represent humans, particularly people who are immersed in the superficial world of appearances. ... In his allegory, Plato discusses a type of prisoner that is freed from their chains. Plato believes that these freed prisoners are the philosophers.</p><p></p><p></p><p>In Plato's “Allegory of the Cave”, the cave, chains, and fire are used to demonstrate what prisoners lacked. Within Plato's Allegory the cave, chains, and fire represent the prisoners limitation to knowledge, free will, and truth</p><p></p><p>But the prisoners think that he is dangerous because the information that he tells them is so abstract and opposed to what they know. The prisoners choose not to be free because they are comfortable in their own world of ignorance, and they are hostile to people who want to give them an alternative view of the world.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
