Majority say that they can resume activities such as going to restaurants, visiting family and friends, and using public transportation around August to December this year. Recovery for travel, culture, and fitness industries might be longer as Filipinos most have expressed that they will neither go to cultural events/gatherings nor go to the gym for the remainder of the year. They are also still on a wait-and-see for domestic and international travel.When asked what Filipinos plan to spend on after movement restrictions, spending on essentials will still continue: food for cooking at home, cleaning products, and personal care items. Filipinos will however minimize expenditures compared before on restaurants and cafes, travel, and cultural activities than before.During the ECQ, it was apparent that Filipinos engaged in online shopping and deliveries versus physical visits to restaurants, shops/malls. </p><br />

Instructions: Research on important news related to current issues facing the Philippines. The news can be related to politics, economy, or the way of life of Filipinos today. If you were to write your own version of your chosen current issue, how will you go about it?
You story shall compose of 3- 4 </h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the major current issues in the Philippines is the high inflation rate, which has caused a rise in the cost of living and affected the purchasing power of many Filipinos. The inflation rate has been on an upward trend since 2018, with a peak of 6.7% in September of that year. Although it has since decreased, it remains above the government's target range of 2-4%.</p><p></p><p>The high inflation rate is caused by several factors, including supply chain disruptions, increased demand for goods and services, and rising global commodity prices. These factors have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has disrupted global trade and supply chains.</p><p></p><p>The impact of high inflation is felt most by low-income households, who spend a larger portion of their income on basic necessities. This has led to a rise in poverty and an increase in the number of Filipinos who are struggling to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>To address this issue, the government has launched various initiatives to stabilize prices and promote economic growth. These include measures to increase the supply of goods and services, such as improving transportation infrastructure and supporting local industries. The government has also implemented social protection programs to provide assistance to vulnerable households.</p><p></p><p>However, addressing the root causes of high inflation requires a coordinated effort from various stakeholders, including the government, businesses, and consumers. It is important to promote sustainable economic growth and stability while ensuring that the benefits of growth are shared equitably among all Filipinos.</p><p></p><p>As a historian, it is important to document and reflect on the impact of high inflation on the Philippines and the responses of various stakeholders to this issue.

                        <p>One way that households might cope with rising food prices is by finding ways to save money on groceries. This could include shopping at discount stores or bulk retailers, using coupons and discounts, and buying generic or store-brand products instead of name-brand items. Households could also try to stretch their food budget by using leftovers, buying in-season produce, and avoiding waste.</p><p></p><p>Another way to cope with rising food prices is by looking for alternative sources of food. For example, households could try growing their own fruits and vegetables in a home garden, joining a community garden, or purchasing produce directly from local farmers. These options can often provide fresher, healthier food at lower prices than what is available at supermarkets.</p><p></p><p>It is also important for the government to take action to address the situation with rising food prices. This could include providing support to farmers and other food producers, implementing policies to increase food security, and offering assistance to households struggling to afford food. The specific actions taken will depend on the details of the situation and the needs of the affected population.</p><p></p><p>In summary, rising food prices can be a challenge for households, especially during times of crisis. Households can try to save money on groceries and look for alternative sources of food, and the government can take action to address the situation and support those in need.</p><br />
