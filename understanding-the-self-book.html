                                            Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the passage "Song of Myself" by Walt Whitman, he implores the reader to embrace individualism and reject the idea of relying on second-hand information, whether it be from books, the dead, or even the speaker himself. Instead, the reader is encouraged to think independently, to listen to all sides, and to form their own conclusions.</p><p></p><p>Whitman's message is clear: we should not blindly accept what others tell us, but rather, we should question and critically evaluate the information we receive. By doing so, we can form our own beliefs and ideas, rather than simply adopting those of others.</p><p></p><p>In today's age of information overload, Whitman's message is particularly relevant. With social media, news outlets, and countless online sources all vying for our attention, it is easy to become overwhelmed and simply accept what we are told. However, by taking a step back and evaluating the information we receive, we can become more informed and discerning individuals.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Whitman's message encourages empathy and open-mindedness. By listening to all sides and filtering them through ourselves, we can gain a greater understanding of others' perspectives and experiences. This can help us to form deeper connections with others, and to appreciate the diversity of thoughts and opinions that make up our world.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "Song of Myself" is a powerful call to embrace individualism, to think critically and independently, and to remain open to the perspectives and experiences of others. It is a message that is as relevant today as it was when it was written, and one that we would all do well to heed.</p><p> </p><br />

                            30. Paul Churchland and Patricia Church Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland, who are both neuroscientists, introduced eliminate materialism-"a radical claim that ordinary, common sense understanding of the mind is deeply wrong and that some or all of the mental states posited by common sense do not actually exist" (Ramsey, 2013). For them, it is false to daim that folk psychology, or common sense psychology, is the capacity to explain mental states of people. Most of people think that we have a stream of consciousness that contains images and conceptions of things about which we have beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes. Our beliefs and attitudes are supported by our feelings, which include mental states like joy and sorrow, or anxiety and relief. It is also a folk belief that our sense of the world and of ourselves is a direct representation of how the world is formed, thus making our bodies reflect or adapt the way the world is (Weed, 2011). The Churchlands argued that talk of mental states would eventually be abandoned in favor of a radically different view of how the brain works not identified with mental states. For them, self is nothing else but brain, or simply, the self is contained entirely within the physical brain. In Patricia Churchland's book Touching a Nerve: The Self as Brain (2013), she wrote: "My brain and I are inseparable. I am who I am because my brain is what it is. Even so, I often think about my brain in terms different from those I use when thinking about myself. I think about my brain as that, and about myself as me. I think about my brain as having neurons, but I think of me as having a memory. Still, I know that my memory is all about the neurons in my brain. Lately, I think about my brains in more intimate terms-as me." This supports the idea that to understand the self, one must study the brain, not just the mind. Put in your own language your understanding of the Philosophy of Churchland and Church about self:​</h2><br />
