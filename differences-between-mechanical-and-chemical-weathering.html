Rocks are mixtures of different minerals. Some (1) are made up of many
minerals while others are made of just one mineral. The minerals that make up rocks are called
(2)
All rocks can be put into one of those fundamental categories based
on their origin. igneous rock got its name from a Latin "word" ignis which means (3)
The parent material of igneous rocks is usually (4)
a molten
from deep within the Earth that cools and hardens. When igneous rocks are exposed at the
surface, they begin to wear away. They are altered either by physical or (5)
processes. Rainwater may fill cracks in rocks and eventually break them
down. Sedimentary rocks are formed from (6)
a process of cementing soft,
unconsolidated sediments into hard rocks,
Rocks when exposed to the environment tend to break down. It is said that rocks
experience weathering. Physical weathering also known as (7)
Weathering refers to the breakdown of rocks without a change in its composition. Chemical
weathering is the decomposition of rocks due to (8) _reactions occurring between the
minerals in rocks and the environment. Water is nature's versatile tool that can bring about (9)
Molecules of some substance in rocks chemically combine with water
molecules in a process called (10)

Physical, or mechanical, weathering happens when rock is broken through the force of another substance on the rock such as ice, running water, wind, rapid heating/cooling, or plant growth. Chemical weathering occurs when reactions between rock and another substance dissolve the rock, causing parts of it to fall away.<br /><br />2.  Chemical weathering demands chemical reactions with minerals inside the rock and causes changes in rock composition.

The parent material of igneous rocks is usually (4)
a molten
from deep within the Earth that cools and hardens. When igneous rocks are exposed at the
surface, they begin to wear away. They are altered either by physical or (5)
processes. Rainwater may fill cracks in rocks and eventually break them
down. Sedimentary rocks are formed from (6)
a process of cementing soft,

Rocks when exposed to the environment tend to break down. It is said that rocks
experience weathering. Physical weathering also known as (7)
Weathering refers to the breakdown of rocks without a change in its composition. Chemical
weathering is the decomposition of rocks due to (8) _reactions occurring between the

Physical, or mechanical, weathering happens when rock is broken through the force of another substance on the rock such as ice, running water, wind, rapid heating/cooling, or plant growth. Chemical weathering occurs when reactions between rock and another substance dissolve the rock, causing parts of it to fall away.</p><p>2.Erosion – The process of moving rocks and soil downhill or into streams, rivers, or oceans. • Deposition – The accumulation or laying down of matter by a natural process, as in the laying down of sediments in streams or rivers.3. Bedrock is the hard, solid rock beneath surface materials such as soil and gravel. Parent rock, also referred to as substratum, refers to the original rock from which something else was formed.4. Residual soils are products of chemical weathering whose characteristics depend upon environmental factors of climate, parent material, topography and drainage, and age.
