Many people are pretty casual about making promises. As a result, promises are frequently made at the drop of hat with no real intention of keeping it. When you break a promise no matter how small it may seem to you. Alarm bells aren’t going to go off, but it can damage relationship or your reputation. Just like what happened on the story. Think about it, when someone else breaks a promise to you or gets caught in a lie doesn’t make you feel violated or cheated? You can’t help wondering whether you were wrong to ever trust that person. So never make promises you know you can’t keep.</p><br />

                        <p>There was once a man named Daeogdog who lived in a quiet village in the Aklan province. He was known for his quick, explosive temper and for always trying to get his way. Thus, it was no surprise when he forced his beautiful and gentle daughter, Aganhon, into an engagement with Maeopig, a young man who was as quarrelsome and domineering as he was. Aganhon pleaded with her father to cancel the engagement, but he flatly refused and kept insisting that his choice was the best.
</p><p>On the day of the wedding, Aganhon was nowhere to be found. The bridal party searched high and low, until someone finally ventured into a nearby stream and stumbled upon the young bride’s motionless body, with a dagger sticking out of the poor girl’s chest.
</p><p>Stricken with grief and remorse, Daeogdog dreamt of his daughter on the night of her funeral. In the dream, Aganhon led her father to a tree that grew on the spot where they found her body. As soon as he awakened, Daeogdog rushed over to the stream and found the same tree, its branches heavy with bright yellow fruits that were shaped like hearts.</p><p>He sampled one and found it to be as sweet and tender as the heart of the daughter whose feelings he callously disregarded. He called it “mango”/”mangga”, which meant “heart-shaped” in their ancient tongue.</p><br />

The brothers were fond of hunting, and since no mountains had formed there was no good place to catch wild pig and deer, and the older brother said, "Let us cause water to flow over all the world and cover it, and then mountains will rise up."<br />So they caused water to flow over all the earth, and when it was covered they took the head-basket [a bamboo basket, in which the heads of victims are kept prior to the head-taking celebration] of the town and set it for a trap. The brothers were very much pleased when they went to look at their trap, for they had caught not only many wild pigs and deer, but also many people.<br />Now Lumawig looked down from his place in the sky and saw that his sons had flooded the earth and that in all the world there was just one spot which was not covered. And he saw that all the people in the world had been drowned except one brother and sister who lived in Pokis.<br />Then Lumawig descended, and he called to the boy and girl, saying, "Oh, you are still alive."<br />"Yes," answered the boy, "we are still alive, but we are very cold."<br />So Lumawig commanded his dog and deer to get fire for the boy and girl. The dog and the deer swam quickly away, but though Lumawig waited a long time they did not return, and all the time the boy and girl were growing colder.<br />Finally Lumawig himself went after the dog and the deer, and when he reached them he said, "Why are you so long in bringing the fire to Pokis? Get ready and come quickly while I watch you, for the boy and girl are very cold."<br />Then the dog and the deer took the fire and started to swim through the flood, but when they had gone only a little way, the fire was put out.<br />Lumawig commanded them to get more fire and they did so, but they swam only a little way again when that of the deer went out, and that of the dog would have been extinguished also had not Lumawig gone quickly to him and taken it.<br />As soon as Lumawig reached Pokis he built a big fire which warmed the brother and sister; and the water evaporated so that the world was as it was before, except that now there were mountains. The brother and sister married and had children, and thus there came to be many people on the earth.<br />

However, the king also fell in love with the girl so he gave Patih a difficult task to complete - to bring him three golden rings from Indran Kingdom, a kingdom of criminals. When he left, the king proposed to the girl, and she refused him, so he sent her to jail. Patih succeeded in bringing the rings, and when he returned and didn't find the girl there, the king told him she was in jail because she asked him (the king) to marry her and wanted to be the queen. He believed him, and she told him to throw her into the river, and if it smelled good, it means that she is innocent. The river did smell good, but of course, the girl died. Now, when the river smells good, the people say Banyuwangi, banyu means water, and wangi means good smell.<br />
