                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Use "Filipino" instead of "Philippine" or "Pilipino": The term "Filipino" is the preferred term when referring to the people and the culture of the Philippines. The term "Philippine" is often associated with government or official contexts, while "Pilipino" is an outdated term that was used during the Marcos regime.</p><p></p><p>2. Use "Bayanihan" instead of "Community Service": Bayanihan is a traditional Filipino concept of community unity and cooperation to achieve a common goal. It is a term that resonates with many Filipinos and reflects the country's culture of helping each other. Using the term "Bayanihan" instead of "community service" is more culturally appropriate and respectful.</p><p></p><p>3. Use "Indigenous Peoples" instead of "Tribal Groups": In the Philippine context, the term "Indigenous Peoples" is used to refer to the various ethnic groups who have been living in the country long before the arrival of the Spanish colonizers. The term "tribal groups" is considered outdated and sometimes carries a negative connotation. Using "Indigenous Peoples" shows respect for the diversity and cultural heritage of these groups.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:By the late 18th century, political and economic changes in Europe were finally beginning to affect Spain and, thus, the Philippines. Important as a stimulus to trade was the gradual elimination of the monopoly enjoyed by the galleon to Acapulco. The last galleon arrived in Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s Manila was open to foreign merchants almost without restriction. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The growth of commercial agriculture resulted in the appearance of a new class. Alongside the landholdings of the church and the rice estates of the pre-Spanish nobility there arose haciendas of coffee, hemp, and sugar, often the property of enterprising Chinese-Filipino mestizos. Some of the families that gained prominence in the 19th century have continued to play an important role in Philippine economics and politics.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:pa brainliest</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
