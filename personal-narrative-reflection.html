A travelogue requires the writer to describe his or her travel experiences vividly and create imagery in the mind of the readers. Blogs are only intended for food concepts. 2. An autobiography uses third person point of view. A biography utilizes the first person point of view.3. Personal and true narratives are based on real life events. Personal narratives focus on a topic through the lens of the personal experiences of the narrator. 4. Reflective essays focus on narrating someone else's life. A travel experience once it is published in a personal website is considered a travel blog. 5. Biographies and autobiographies focus on single events in life. Testimonios contain an account of experiences of a person shared by another person. 6. A reportage presents facts in a literary way. Reflective essays can be crafted based on any moment in one's life that instills lessons. 7.Reflective essays, testimonies, and personal narratives are autobiographical in nature. A true narrative only tells personal experiences8. A written work is called a personal narrative if the author shares his or her experience of an event in his or her life. Someone else's moment in his or her life written by another person is a true narrative.​</a>

Many schools, such as Bridgewater College and DePaul University, require a reflective essay that documents your growth at the school. A reflective essay gives the reader a reflection of you, the writer, that tells them what kind of person you are. It should relate to your experience, but more importantly, it should focus on your personal change -- your attitude -- due to those experiences.</p><p></p><p>Narrative Essay</p><p>As opposed to the reflective essay, a narrative essay focuses on a specific event or a short sequence of events. Generally, this event would precipitate a change in belief or attitude in the writer. However, the emphasis is on the story itself. Purdue OWL recommends including all elements of a story, such as introduction, characters, plot, setting, climax and resolution. Telling a good story is important, but don't get sidetracked from incorporating your strengths, which is what the reader is ultimately interested in.</p>1.
