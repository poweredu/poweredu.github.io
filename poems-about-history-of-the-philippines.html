The guerilla is like a poet
Keen to the rustle of leaves
The break of twigs
The ripples of the river
And the smell of fire
And the ashes of departure.
The guerilla is like a poet.
He has submerged with the trees
The bushes and the rocks
Ambiguous but precise
Well-versed on the law of motion
And master of myriad images
