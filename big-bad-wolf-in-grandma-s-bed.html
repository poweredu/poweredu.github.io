The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks.A big bad wolf saw the two little pigs while they danced and played and thought, "What juicy tender mealsthey will make!" He chased the two pigs and they ran and hid in their houses. The big bad wolf went to thefirst house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in minutes.The frightened little pig ran to the second pig's house that was made of sticks. The big bad wolf now cameto this house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in hardly any time.

They built their houses very quickly and then sang and danced all day because theywere lazy. The third little pig worked hard all day and built his house with bricks.A big bad wolf saw the two little pigs while they danced and played and thought, "What juicy tender mealsthey will make!" He chased the two pigs and they ran and hid in their houses. The big bad wolf went to thefirst house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in minutes.The frightened little pig ran to the second pig's house that was made of sticks. The big bad wolf now cameto this house and huffed and puffed and blew the house down in hardly any time. Now, the two little pigswere terrified and ran to the third pig's house that was made of bricks.The big bad wolf tried to huff and puff and blow the house down, but he could not. He kept trying for hoursbut the house was very strong and the little pigs were safe inside. He tried to enter through the chimney butthe third little pig boiled a big pot of water and kept it below the chimney.

It is the part of the story where the consequences of the climax are revealed, and loose ends are tied up. In this case, the climax of the story would be the moment of highest tension or conflict, which would likely involve the wolf and pigs. The falling action would then follow, showing how the story's conflicts and tensions begin to be resolved. In this case, the falling action involves Pig #3 helping the big bad wolf get out of the fire, which shows that the characters are beginning to overcome their differences and work together.</p><p></p><p>Pa-brainliest if naka tulong.:))</p><br />

                            22. Who's story was telling the truth, 
the Wolf (the big bad wolf) or the three little pigs?
Backstory: The three little pigs story-- they said the wolf was going to eat them hence they charge him for attempted murder. 
But the wolfs story he said he has a cold and accidentally blowing way their houses</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story of the three little pigs is a fictional story, so there is no factual account of what happened between the characters in the story. It is up to the interpretation of the reader or listener as to which story they believe is true.</p><p></p><p>However, in the context of the story, it is the three little pigs who are telling the <strong>truth</strong> about the wolf attempting to eat them. The wolf's story of accidentally blowing away their houses due to a cold may be an attempt to excuse his behavior and avoid responsibility for his actions.</p>I cannot determine who is telling the truth with certainty since I cannot make value judgments or have personal opinions. However, based on the classic story of the Three Little Pigs, it is commonly believed that the three little pigs' story is more likely to be true. In the story, the wolf is portrayed as a cunning and deceptive character who tries to trick the pigs into letting him in their homes, and eventually, he blows their houses down with the intention of eating them. On the other hand, the wolf's story of having a cold and accidentally blowing the houses down seems like an excuse to avoid taking responsibility for his actions. Therefore, based on the story's narrative, it is more likely that the three little pigs' version of the story is the accurate one.<br />
