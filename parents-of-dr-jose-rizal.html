                                            I. Share your viewpoints together with your family members (2 members) regarding the issue below. (5 POINTS) Jose Rizal said "Ang Kabataan ang Pag-Asa ng Bayan" because he believes that the hope of the country is at the youth so it is important to give them the best education. If all the youth can have a good education, the country's workforce would be enough to fulfill the needs of the citizen in the country. But now the youth that Rizal is referring to, are more interested in different vices like cigarettes liq*or, dr*gs, marij*ana, po*nography, and ga*bling. Their addiction to this is too much that they cannot focus on their studies. Though parents want to give their best to their children, the environment that surrounds them greatly affects their disposition in life. And in the end, they stop their schooling.

                                            2. The first man to answer the call of his country and people was Dr. Jose P. Rizal, the national hero, also called “Indio Bravo,” and the First Filipino. He was persecuted as a student because of a brilliant mind. He had a secret pact with his brother Protacio to leave the Philippines and study abroad without the knowledge of their parents, so he could better prepare for the liberation of his race. His books prepared the minds of his people to fight against tyranny and abuse. Rizal’s sacrifice is an inspiration to all. He has left a legacy that is worthy of emulation by the young.

Biag ni Lam-ang by Pedro Bucaneg
Don Juan and his wife Namongan lived in Nalbuan, now part of La Union in the northern part of the Philippines. They had a son named Lam-ang. Before Lam-ang was born, Don Juan went to the mountains in order to punish a group of their Igorot enemies. While he was away, his son Lam-ang was born. It took four people to help Namongan give birth. As soon as the baby boy popped out, he spoke and asked that he be given the name Lam-ang. He also chose his godparents and asked where his father was.
After nine months of waiting for his father to return, Lam-ang decided he would go look for him. Namongan thought  Lam-ang was up to the challenge but she was sad to let him go.
During his exhausting journey, he decided to rest for awhile. He fell asleep and had a dream about his father’s head being stuck on a pole by the Igorot. Lam-ang was furious when he learned what had happened to his father. He rushed to their village and killed them all, except for one whom he let go so that he could tell other people about Lam-ang’s greatness.
Upon returning to Nalbuan in triumph, he was bathed by women in the Amburayan river. All the fish died because of the dirt and odor from Lam-ang’s body.
There was a young woman named Ines Kannoyan whom Lam-ang wanted to woo.  She lived in Calanutian and he brought along his white rooster and gray dog to visit her. On the way, Lam-ang met his enemy Sumarang, another suitor of Ines whom he fought and readily defeated.
Lam-ang found the house of Ines surrounded by  many suitors all of whom were trying to catch her attention.  He had his rooster crow, which caused a nearby house to fall.  This made Ines look out. He had his dog bark and in an instant the fallen house rose up again. The girl’s parents witnessed this and called for him. The rooster expressed the love of Lam-ang. The parents agreed to a marriage with their daughter if Lam-ang would give them a dowry valued at double their wealth. Lam-ang had no problem fulfilling this condition and he and Ines were married.
It was a tradition to have a newly married man swim in the river for the rarang fish. Unfortunately, Lam-ang dove straight into the mouth of the water monster Berkakan. Ines had Marcos get his bones, which she covered with a piece of cloth. His rooster crowed and his dog barked and slowly the bones started to move. Back alive, Lam-ang and his wife lived happily ever after with his white rooster and gray dog.

                                            The first man to answer the call of his country and people was
Dr. Jose P. Rizal, the national hero, also called “Indio Bravo,” and the
First Filipino. He was persecuted as a student because of a brilliant
mind. He had a secret pact with his brother Protacio to leave the
Philippines and study abroad without the knowledge of their parents,
so he could better prepare for the liberation of his race. His books
prepared the minds of his people to fight against tyranny and abuse.
Rizal’s sacrifice is an inspiration to all. He has left a legacy that is

                            5. I. Share your viewpoints together with your family members (2 members) regarding the issue below. (5 POINTS) Jose Rizal said "Ang Kabataan ang Pag-Asa ng Bayan" because he believes that the hope of the country is at the youth so it is important to give them the best education. If all the youth can have a good education, the country's workforce would be enough to fulfill the needs of the citizen in the country. But now the youth that Rizal is referring to, are more interested in different vices like cigarettes liq*or, dr*gs, marij*ana, po*nography, and ga*bling. Their addiction to this is too much that they cannot focus on their studies. Though parents want to give their best to their children, the environment that surrounds them greatly affects their disposition in life. And in the end, they stop their schooling.

Biag ni Lam-ang by Pedro Bucaneg
Don Juan and his wife Namongan lived in Nalbuan, now part of La Union in the northern part of the Philippines. They had a son named Lam-ang. Before Lam-ang was born, Don Juan went to the mountains in order to punish a group of their Igorot enemies. While he was away, his son Lam-ang was born. It took four people to help Namongan give birth. As soon as the baby boy popped out, he spoke and asked that he be given the name Lam-ang. He also chose his godparents and asked where his father was.
After nine months of waiting for his father to return, Lam-ang decided he would go look for him. Namongan thought  Lam-ang was up to the challenge but she was sad to let him go.
During his exhausting journey, he decided to rest for awhile. He fell asleep and had a dream about his father’s head being stuck on a pole by the Igorot. Lam-ang was furious when he learned what had happened to his father. He rushed to their village and killed them all, except for one whom he let go so that he could tell other people about Lam-ang’s greatness.
Upon returning to Nalbuan in triumph, he was bathed by women in the Amburayan river. All the fish died because of the dirt and odor from Lam-ang’s body.
There was a young woman named Ines Kannoyan whom Lam-ang wanted to woo.  She lived in Calanutian and he brought along his white rooster and gray dog to visit her. On the way, Lam-ang met his enemy Sumarang, another suitor of Ines whom he fought and readily defeated.
Lam-ang found the house of Ines surrounded by  many suitors all of whom were trying to catch her attention.  He had his rooster crow, which caused a nearby house to fall.  This made Ines look out. He had his dog bark and in an instant the fallen house rose up again. The girl’s parents witnessed this and called for him. The rooster expressed the love of Lam-ang. The parents agreed to a marriage with their daughter if Lam-ang would give them a dowry valued at double their wealth. Lam-ang had no problem fulfilling this condition and he and Ines were married.
It was a tradition to have a newly married man swim in the river for the rarang fish. Unfortunately, Lam-ang dove straight into the mouth of the water monster Berkakan. Ines had Marcos get his bones, which she covered with a piece of cloth. His rooster crowed and his dog barked and slowly the bones started to move. Back alive, Lam-ang and his wife lived happily ever after with his white rooster and gray dog.
