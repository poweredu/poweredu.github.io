                        1. The image of the man with the hoe is of a worker in a field, bent over and plowing the soil. <br />2. The poet describes him as a "brother to the ox" who is "stooping and hoeing in a fallow field." <br />3. The line "What to him are Plato and the swing of Pleiades?" is meant to show that the man with the hoe is unaware of the works of Plato, the Greek philosopher, and the stars in the Pleiades constellation, which are too far above his head to notice. <br />4. The bent body of the man with the hoe signifies the hard labor and toil he endures in his work. <br />5. According to the poet, society is responsible for the condition or state of the man with the hoe, as it is society that has created the system of oppression and inequality which has led to his plight. <br />6. As a child of the "future," I would respond to the question, "How will the Future reckon with this Man?" by recognizing that in order to create a better future, we must address the systemic issues that have led to the marginalization of these people and strive to create a more equitable and just society. <br />7. The modern "man with the hoe" can be seen in those who are oppressed and marginalized in our society, such as the homeless, the poor, and those who are discriminated against. <br />8. Sadly, our society often treats these individuals with apathy and indifference, rather than empathy and compassion. <br />

He is reported to have seen the original painting, which had a profound effect on him, in San Francisco. Markham was at a New Year’s Eve celebration when he read the poem to an editor of the San Francisco Examiner. Shortly thereafter, the poem was published in that paper.</p><p>Because of its popularity, the poem was translated into many languages and reprinted in magazines, newspapers, and books numerous times. The poem’s success allowed Markham to spend more time writing and lecturing. In regard to the reform movements concerning labor struggles of the time, the poem generated much controversy. The newspapers received many letters regarding “The Man with the Hoe.” The poem was open to different interpretations. Some readers said that the poem was advocating socialism: Some were in support of the concept; others were against it. Others said the poem contained a prophetic message that could incite unessential reforms. Still others considered the poem a medium for expressing farmers’ and workers’ grievances.</p><p>For Markham, Millet’s peasant symbolized the exploited classes worldwide. Markham said that he viewed it as “a poem of hope. a cry for justice.” In the fourth stanza, Markham addresses the “masters, lords, and rulers in all lands.” He interrogates them with an implied sense of optimism:</p><p>Is this the handiwork you give to God,This monstrous thing distorted and soul-quenched?How will you ever straighten up this shape,Touch it again with immortality;Give back the upward looking and the light;Rebuild in it the music and the dream;Make right the immemorial infamies,Perfidious wrongs, immedicable woes?</p><br />

                        Man With The Hoe
<p>
</p>The image of the man with the hoe would be a hardworking individual receiving not enough privilege or simply saying over work but under paid.
<p>
</p><p>On the poem by Edwin Markham, it explains how hard it is to live a life that all of us have dreamed and been wanting of. Basically, in a life of a human being, everyone needs to work in order to earn money.
</p><p>
</p><p>The question now is how hard are we working in order to achieve our goals and live the life that we have ever dreamed of. Challenges would arise and getting the right paying employer would be very hard at first. There are employers who would help you be shaped to become successful in life and there are some that would just use your skills to be able for them to succeed and it may sound selfish but it happens in real life.  </p><p>
</p><p>Having a good and proper education may add points for you to be able to get a well-paying job however, life is hard and not all can be able to afford to go to good schools or even finish school due to financial issue or problem.
</p><p>
</p><p>There are employers who would also hire people even though they do not have a degree to show. Some may become successful in it but most of the time people are being used and not treated fairly.  </p><p>
</p><p>It always depends on us if we would tolerate being treated unfairly by some employers. According to the poem, the man has been deprived of basic freedom and treated like a slave. Slave who would serve and please their masters all their lives. It is as if they have given their whole life to their masters.  </p><p>
</p><p>Not treated fairly at work or being treated as a slave is not a healthy work environment. It will fully consume you until you get exhausted and give up.  </p><p>
</p><p>Do not let yourself be treated unfairly. Work at your best and make sure you do not let yourself be used by someone in power.

                            28. Who are the modern “man with the hoe”? (Poem The Man With the Hoe by Edwin Markham)</h2><br />
                        The "man with the hoe" represents slaves and servants who have been robbed of their humanity. The poem alludes how we can make right the bent back of a man who has been abused and stolen of his freedom and facility. Markham asks how we can right a man who we had systematically put down and made to feel like the dirt of the ground. <br /><br />He also uses the men that has been blessed by God to highlight how we should have lived, rather than how we treat these people. <br />
