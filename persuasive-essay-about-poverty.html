                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Poverty can be expressed differently from many viewpoints (Spector, 2013). Poverty is characterized by their physical, mental, and spiritual state. Physically, individuals can be affected by the environment or other factors, such as, their lifestyle. Mentally, individuals affected by poverty are not educated or do not have the opportunity for advancement. Spiritually, they find themselves feeling of hopelessness. Poverty can co-exist within many subcultures that reside is particular areas, consider California. In California, there are dense populations that live below the poverty line that is also a part of other subcultures. When income, education, and lifestyles are compromised many health issues can arise. To comeback these harsh lifestyles, many groups have come together to improve and educate people who currently live in poverty. Health educators also manipulate their strategic efforts to have the most impact on the community. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>HOPE</strong><strong> YOU</strong><strong> UNDERSTAND</strong><strong> ❤️</strong></p><br />

Distress can cause neurotic disorders, and healthy people are less likely to fall prey to them. Physical health refers to the bodily well-being of individuals.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The root cause of poverty is human greed, which leads to corruption. Corruption is a way for the powerful to take advantage of the vulnerable, which can lead to poverty. For example, a corrupt government official might take bribes from a company in exchange for granting them special favors, which would give that company an unfair advantage over other businesses and could lead to poverty for those businesses and their employees.</p><p></p><p><strong>heart</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Rate</strong><strong> </strong><strong>my</strong><strong> </strong><strong>answer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>pls</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>At</strong><strong> </strong><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>follow</strong><strong> </strong><strong>mo</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ako</strong><strong> </strong><strong>thank</strong><strong> </strong><strong>u</strong></p><br />

                        <p>Poverty and economic inequality are two terms that are often used interchangeably, but they have distinct differences. Poverty refers to a lack of access to basic needs such as food, shelter, healthcare, and education. On the other hand, economic inequality refers to the unequal distribution of wealth and resources among individuals or groups within a society. While poverty can be seen as a consequence of economic inequality, it is important to understand that poverty and inequality are not the same.</p><p></p><p>Economic globalization has been a significant force in shaping the global economy, but it has also contributed to rising poverty and inequality. Economic globalization refers to the increased interconnectedness and interdependence of economies around the world, resulting from the expansion of trade, investment, and technology. While economic globalization has brought significant benefits to many countries, such as increased economic growth and job creation, it has also contributed to a widening gap between the rich and the poor.</p><p></p><p>The impact of economic globalization on poverty and inequality has been a subject of much debate. On one hand, some argue that economic globalization has lifted millions of people out of poverty by creating jobs, increasing access to goods and services, and boosting economic growth. However, others argue that economic globalization has contributed to rising inequality by favoring the rich and powerful while leaving many behind.</p><p></p><p>The effects of economic globalization on poverty and inequality are complex and multifaceted. While globalization has created new opportunities for economic growth and development, it has also contributed to widening inequality and poverty in many countries. It is important for policymakers to address these issues by implementing policies that promote inclusive growth, social protection, and sustainable development.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty and economic inequality are two distinct but related issues that require different policy interventions. Economic globalization has brought both opportunities and challenges, and its impact on poverty and inequality is a matter of ongoing debate. By understanding the differences between poverty and inequality and working towards inclusive and sustainable development, we can create a more equitable and prosperous world for all.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Poverty is the worst form of violence”. – Mahatma Gandhi.</p><p></p><p>We can define poverty as the condition where the basic needs of a family, like food, shelter, clothing, and education are not fulfilled. It can lead to other problems like poor literacy, unemployment, malnutrition, etc. A poor person is not able to get education due to lack of money and therefore remains unemployed. An unemployed person is not able to buy enough &amp; nutritious food for his family and their health decline. A weak person lacks the energy required for the job. A  jobless person remains poor only. Thus we can say that poverty is the root cause of other problems.</p><p></p><p>How Poverty is Measured?</p><p></p><p>For measuring poverty United nations have devised two measures of poverty – Absolute &amp; relative poverty.  Absolute poverty is used to measure poverty in developing countries like India. Relative poverty is used to measure poverty in developed countries like the USA. In absolute poverty, a line based on the minimum level of income has been created &amp; is called a poverty line.  If per day income of a family is below this level, then it is poor or below the poverty line. If per day income of a family is above this level, then it is non-poor or above the poverty line. In India, the new poverty line is  Rs 32 in rural areas and Rs 47 in urban areas.</p><p></p><p>Causes of Poverty</p><p></p><p>According to the Noble prize winner South African leader, Nelson Mandela – “Poverty is not natural, it is manmade”. The above statement is true as the causes of poverty are generally man-made. There are various causes of poverty but the most important is population. Rising population is putting the burden on the resources &amp; budget of countries. Governments are finding difficult to provide food, shelter &amp; employment to the rising population.</p><p></p><p>The other causes are- lack of education, war, natural disaster, lack of employment, lack of infrastructure, political instability, etc. For instance- lack of employment opportunities makes a person jobless &amp; he is not able to earn enough to fulfill the basic necessities of his family &amp; becomes poor. Lack of education compels a person for less paying jobs &amp; it makes him poorer. Lack of infrastructure means there are no industries, banks, etc. in a country resulting in lack of employment opportunities. Natural disasters like flood, earthquake also contribute to poverty.</p><p></p><p>In some countries, especially African countries like Somalia, a long period of civil war has made poverty widespread. This is because all the resources &amp; money is being spent in war instead of public welfare. Countries like India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, etc. are prone to natural disasters like cyclone, etc. These disasters occur every year causing poverty to rise.</p><p></p><p>Ill Effects of Poverty</p><p></p><p>Poverty affects the life of a poor family. A poor person is not able to take proper food &amp; nutrition &amp;his capacity to work reduces. Reduced capacity to work further reduces his income, making him poorer. Children from poor family never get proper schooling &amp; proper nutrition. They have to work to support their family &amp; this destroys their childhood. Some of them may also involve in crimes like theft, murder, robbery, etc. A poor person remains uneducated &amp; is forced to live under unhygienic conditions in slums. There are no proper sanitation &amp; drinking water facility in slums &amp; he falls ill often &amp;  his health deteriorates. A poor person generally dies an early death. So, all social evils are related to poverty.</p><p></p><p>Government Schemes to Remove Poverty</p><p></p><p>The government of India also took several measures to eradicate poverty from India. Some of them are – creating employment opportunities, controlling population, etc. In India, about 60% of the population is still dependent on agriculture for its livelihood. Government has taken certain measures to promote agriculture in India. The government constructed certain dams &amp; canals in our country to provide easy availability of water for irrigation. Government has also taken steps for the cheap availability of seeds &amp; farming equipment to promote agriculture. Government is also promoting farming of cash crops like cotton, instead of food crops. In cities, the government is promoting industrialization to create more jobs. Government has also opened  ‘Ration shops’. Other measures include providing free &amp; compulsory education for children up to 14 years of age, scholarship to deserving students from a poor background, providing subsidized houses to poor people, etc.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is a social evil, we can also contribute to control it. For example- we can simply donate old clothes to poor people, we can also sponsor the education of a poor child or we can utilize our free time by teaching poor students. Remember before wasting food, somebody is still sleeping hungry.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Poverty is a complex issue that is influenced by a variety of factors including culture and society. In many cases, cultural and societal norms perpetuate poverty by creating barriers to access and opportunities. This essay will examine the ways in which culture and society contribute to poverty and what can be done to address these issues.</p><p></p><p>Culture plays a significant role in shaping attitudes and behaviors towards poverty. In some cultures, poverty is seen as a personal failing and a result of laziness or lack of effort. This perspective can lead to stigmatization of those living in poverty and create a cycle of shame and isolation. On the other hand, some cultures view poverty as a structural issue and believe that everyone has a responsibility to support those in need. These cultural differences can impact policy decisions and shape the way in which poverty is addressed.</p><p></p><p>Society also plays a role in perpetuating poverty. In many cases, societal systems and structures create barriers to access and opportunities for those living in poverty. For example, inadequate education and job training programs can limit the ability of individuals to find stable employment and improve their economic status. Additionally, discriminatory practices in housing, healthcare, and the justice system can further marginalize those living in poverty.</p><p></p><p>In order to address poverty, it is important to examine the ways in which culture and society contribute to the issue. One approach is to shift cultural attitudes towards poverty by promoting empathy and understanding. This can be achieved through education campaigns and public messaging that challenges negative stereotypes and promotes a culture of compassion.</p><p></p><p>On a societal level, policies and programs must be put in place to remove barriers to access and opportunities for those living in poverty. This can include investing in education and job training programs, providing affordable housing and healthcare, and reforming discriminatory practices within the justice system.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, poverty is a complex issue that is shaped by cultural and societal factors. It is important to address these underlying causes in order to create lasting change and improve the lives of those living in poverty. By promoting a culture of empathy and implementing policies that remove barriers to access and opportunities, we can work towards a more equitable and just society for all.</p><br />

An unknown author once said, “Poverty is a choice, and not fate.” No one ever wanted to be poor; thus there must be reasons why they had come up to their situation. Some believe that the government has something to do with the constantly increasing number of poor people, but is it really their fault? I guess they get the blames because they are the one who has all the fund of our country.</p><p></p><p>HOPE IT HELPS</p><p>STAY SAFE AND STUDY MORE! </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Farmers, Fisherfolk, and Individuals Residing in Rural Areas had the highest poverty rates among the basic sectors in 2018, according to the PSA (Philippine Statistics Authority). In my opinion this is due to the lack of sustainable development and negligence by the government in these provincial areas. This is most evident when farmers who are in charge of producing vegetables, fruits, and other plant-based foods are underpaid and exploited by larger companies who resell their products. Individuals living in cities, seniors, migrant workers, and formal sector workers, on the other hand, had the lowest poverty rates among the basic sectors in 2018, at 9.3, 9.1, and 8.8%, respectively. Poverty is still present in more urbanized areas of the country , but it is significantly lower than that experienced by those living in rural areas. Because cities are often more developed, living in one provides more opportunities to earn financially.</p><p></p><br />

                            29. Write an Informative Essay about "World Poverty" ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Poverty is one of the biggest problems in the world today and it just keeps growing. Poverty is when you have either no money or you don’t have enough money to support yourself or your family. Poverty is one of the biggest issues in the world if not the biggest. Absolute poverty is when you don’t have clothes, food, shelter, health, and occupation. In every place in the world, there is somebody in poverty.</p><p></p><p>Poverty is important because it is all over the world and some people are in poverty because of their country’s leader. Poverty has been around since the beginning of time and we still haven’t done anything to fix it or drop the percentage. Poverty can ruin an entire country to, if a country is in bad economic condition its population will eventually start to drop or never gain. Poverty can cause epidemics sometimes to because if people can’t afford medicine and someone gets sick that sickness will spread.

                        <p><strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong></p><p></p><p><strong>ESSAY</strong><strong> </strong><strong>ABOUT</strong><strong> </strong><strong>WOLRD</strong><strong> </strong><strong>POVERTY</strong><strong>;</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>How can there be so much misery and insecurity in the midst of such abundance? One of the first things we see is that poverty doesn’t exist all by itself. It is simply one end of an overall distribution of income and wealth in society as a whole. Poverty is both a structural aspect of the system and consequence of how the system is organized and how people participate in it.</strong></p><p><strong>The system we have for producing and distributing wealth is capitalist. It is organized in ways that allow a small portion (the 1%) to control most of the capital (factories, machinery, tools) used to produce wealth.</strong></p><p><strong>Nowadays, as people know that poverty refers to one of the biggest issues in the world so far. Many countries around the world still suffer from it and have difficult times to get rid of it. The phenomenon of poverty, an important phenomenon hard to identify and it destroys some countries in certain aspects and this issue can cause other problems for all economic and political aspects. I think that, there are many major reasons that put the world in this a bad situation. The first and most important reason that put some countries in poverty is the political instability. Political instability is one of the factors associated with poverty. In most of the countries in the world, there is a political instability.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>PLSS FOLLOW AND LIKE FOR MORE HELPS, THANKS</p><p></p><br />
