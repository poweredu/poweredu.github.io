                                            The Commission on Population and Development said Friday that pregnancy among 15-19-year-old women in the Philippines saw a slight decrease from 2017 to 2018—or from 182,906 to 181,717.But there is a grimmer finding: Pregnancy is on the rise among girls aged between 10 and 14—specifically, a 63-percent jump from figures in 2011 and 2018. Some 2,250 babies were born to mothers in this age group two years ago.According to the commission, there are several factors responsible for the trend observed among younger adolescents and their older counterparts. These factors are both individual and institutional.Babies having babiesAmong the individual factors are the early onset of menstruation, lack of education, and exposure to risky behaviors on the internet and among their group of friends.Meanwhile, the institutional factors include information dissemination and provision of access to family planning services.Popcom chief Juan Antonio Perez III attributes the drop in pregnancy rates among the older group to institutional work.For the 10-14-year-olds, however, greater involvement of adults and institutions may be needed. The approach should be cultural, he says.A 2016 study, “Education, Earnings and Health Effects of Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines” by Alejandro Herrin, found that early childbearing reduces an adolescent’s future earning capacity because it diminishes the chances of completing high school.A lack of diploma results in a loss of P300 in income per day for young mothers.It is clear that the government must aggressively push for the prevention of teenage pregnancy by strategically addressing the individual factors that contribute to it. For instance, parents and schools must make themselves more aware of children’s activities in and out of the home or classroom—specifically, online and within their social circles.Risky behaviors are occasioned by lack of education and guidance, and adults must eschew the belief that not talking about sex is a way of protecting or shielding their daughters from harm. Quite the opposite, actually.Meanwhile, the government must do its part by sustaining the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law down to the community level to reach as many young people as possible.Perez, in an earlier statement, said that while the direct impact of such measures could be observed in households, they could make a dent on the macroeconomy, specifically by curbing poverty.Reduction of unplanned pregnancies translates in to family savings, which could be allocated to other items—education, healthcare, livelihood—that could be seen as improvements in the quality of life and investments for a better future.Children should enjoy their childhood and be given the opportunity to be deliberate about their life. Keeping them in the dark about the risks that lurk around them is not protecting them—it is making them vulnerable.MY REACTION______GUIDE QUESTION1.What is the editorial about?What is the stand or position of the writer regarding the issue?2.What are the pieces of evidence the support the editor's claim or position?3.Do you agree with the writer?Explain your answer.4.What is your reaction about the editorial?5.What do you think are the major considerations to note when doing a critical reading of a text like an editorial?​</a>

Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines The issue of teenage pregnancy is widespread in various parts of the country. Today, we face the painful reality that at a very young age, young people have children of their own. During the World Population Day Forum held in Quezon City last July 2019, the Commission on Population (Popcom) raised concerns about early and unplanned pregnancies by citing that around 500 teenage girls have given birth in the country every day as more adolescents engage in premarital sex. Popcom said some 196,000 Filipinos between the ages of 15 and 19 years old get pregnant each year. In the Philippines, according to the 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) and the 2013 Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study (YAFSS), the number of women aged 15-19 who have begun childbearing increased from eight percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2013.</a>

You will crawl on your belly an eat dust all the days of your life. I will make you enemies, you and the woman, your offspring. He will crush your head and you will strike his heel.”    To the woman, God said “I will increase your suffering in childbearing, and you will give birth to your children in pain. You will be dependent on your husband and he will lord it over you.”     To the man, He said, because you have listened to your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I forbade you to eat, cursed be the soil because of you! In suffering you will provide food for yourself from it, all the days of your life. It will produce thorn and thistle for you and you will eat the plants of the field. With sweat on your face you will eat your bread, until you return to clay, since it was from clay that you were taken, for you are dust and to dust you shall return.”    The man called his wife by the name of Eve, because she was the mother of all the living. Yahweh god made garments of skin for the man and his wife, and with these he clothed them. Then Yahweh god said, “man has become like one of us, making himself judge of good and evil. Let him stretch out his hand to take and eat from the tree of Life as well, and live forever.” So God cast him from the Garden of Eden to toil the soil from which he had been made. And after having driven the man out, god posted Cherubim and a flaming sword that kept turning at the east of the Garden of Eden to guard the way to the tree of LifeAnswer the following questions1 What did God say to the serpent after tempting the woman to disobey his command of not eating the forbidden fruit?2 What did God say to the woman after she had disobeyed command?3 What was the punishment God gave to the man?4 Why did God call the woman Eve?5 What prompted God to promise a Messiah or Redeemer to man ?

Directions: Read the given situation carefully then do what is being asked for. (15 points) Situation: The World Health Organization (WHO) reported that about 16 million adolescent girls between 15 and 19 years of age gave birth each year. Knowing the adverse effects of adolescent childbearing on the health of the mothers as well as their infants, a group of students from Jose F. Diaz Memorial National High School volunteered to help the government in its campaign for the prevention of early pregnancy by giving lectures to 7 barangays in San Mateo about WHO Guidelines on teenage pregnancy. The group started in Barangay 1 and 4 girls attended the lecture. Girls from other barangays heard about it, so 8 girls attended from Barangay 2, 16 from Barangay 3, and so on. 1. Make a table representing the number of adolescent girls who attended the lecture from Barangay 1 to Barangay 7, if the number of attendees doubles each barangay. 2. Analyze the data in the table and create a formula. Use the formula to justify your data in the table. 3. Because people who heard about the lecture given by the group thought that it would be beneficial to them, 5 more different barangays requested the group to do the lectures for them. If the number of young girls who will listen to the lecture from these five barangays will increase in the same manner as that of the first 7 barangays, determine the total number of girls who will benefit from the lecture.with solution po sana ​</a>

                            6. The Commission on Population and Development said Friday that pregnancy among 15-19-year-old women in the Philippines saw a slight decrease from 2017 to 2018—or from 182,906 to 181,717.But there is a grimmer finding: Pregnancy is on the rise among girls aged between 10 and 14—specifically, a 63-percent jump from figures in 2011 and 2018. Some 2,250 babies were born to mothers in this age group two years ago.According to the commission, there are several factors responsible for the trend observed among younger adolescents and their older counterparts. These factors are both individual and institutional.Babies having babiesAmong the individual factors are the early onset of menstruation, lack of education, and exposure to risky behaviors on the internet and among their group of friends.Meanwhile, the institutional factors include information dissemination and provision of access to family planning services.Popcom chief Juan Antonio Perez III attributes the drop in pregnancy rates among the older group to institutional work.For the 10-14-year-olds, however, greater involvement of adults and institutions may be needed. The approach should be cultural, he says.A 2016 study, “Education, Earnings and Health Effects of Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines” by Alejandro Herrin, found that early childbearing reduces an adolescent’s future earning capacity because it diminishes the chances of completing high school.A lack of diploma results in a loss of P300 in income per day for young mothers.It is clear that the government must aggressively push for the prevention of teenage pregnancy by strategically addressing the individual factors that contribute to it. For instance, parents and schools must make themselves more aware of children’s activities in and out of the home or classroom—specifically, online and within their social circles.Risky behaviors are occasioned by lack of education and guidance, and adults must eschew the belief that not talking about sex is a way of protecting or shielding their daughters from harm. Quite the opposite, actually.Meanwhile, the government must do its part by sustaining the implementation of the Reproductive Health Law down to the community level to reach as many young people as possible.Perez, in an earlier statement, said that while the direct impact of such measures could be observed in households, they could make a dent on the macroeconomy, specifically by curbing poverty.Reduction of unplanned pregnancies translates in to family savings, which could be allocated to other items—education, healthcare, livelihood—that could be seen as improvements in the quality of life and investments for a better future.Children should enjoy their childhood and be given the opportunity to be deliberate about their life. Keeping them in the dark about the risks that lurk around them is not protecting them—it is making them vulnerable.MY REACTION______GUIDE QUESTION1.What is the editorial about?What is the stand or position of the writer regarding the issue?2.What are the pieces of evidence the support the editor's claim or position?3.Do you agree with the writer?Explain your answer.4.What is your reaction about the editorial?5.What do you think are the major considerations to note when doing a critical reading of a text like an editorial?​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>An increase in the average childbearing age group can lead to a decrease in the population growth rate. This is because as women have children later in life, there are fewer births overall and the rate of population growth slows.</p><p></p><p>There are several factors that can contribute to the trend of older childbearing women in "first world" countries compared to "third world" countries. One factor is access to education and employment opportunities for women. In many "first world" countries, women have more opportunities for education and employment, which can lead to them delaying childbearing in order to pursue their goals. Another factor is access to reproductive health care, including contraception and family planning services. In "first world" countries, these services are often more widely available, which can also contribute to the trend of older childbearing. Additionally, cultural and societal expectations can also play a role. In some societies, it is more common for women to delay childbearing in order to establish their careers or pursue other goals before starting a family.</p><br />

                            12. Make a summary about the topic below and explain why it belongs to that type of qualitative research. 
Teenage Pregnancy in the Philippines The issue of teenage pregnancy is widespread in various parts of the country. Today, we face the painful reality that at a very young age, young people have children of their own. During the World Population Day Forum held in Quezon City last July 2019, the Commission on Population (Popcom) raised concerns about early and unplanned pregnancies by citing that around 500 teenage girls have given birth in the country every day as more adolescents engage in premarital sex. Popcom said some 196,000 Filipinos between the ages of 15 and 19 years old get pregnant each year. In the Philippines, according to the 2013 National Demographic and Health Survey (NDHS) and the 2013 Young Adult Fertility and Sexuality Study (YAFSS), the number of women aged 15-19 who have begun childbearing increased from eight percent in 2003 to 10 percent in 2013.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Teenage pregnancy, also known as adolescent pregnancy, is pregnancy in a female under the age of 20, according to the WHO. Pregnancy can occur with sexual intercourse after the start of ovulation, which can be before the first menstrual period (menarche) but usually occurs after the onset of periods. The main objective of the research was to explore how young women responded to finding out they were pregnant, who they talked to, who supported them, and how their behaviours were influenced by local services, including access to sex education and contraception advice.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The one-child policy was a Chinese government policy to control population growth. According to estimates, it prevented between 200 to 400 million births in the country.
</p><p>It was introduced in 1979 and discontinued in 2015, and enforced through a mix of incentives and sanctions.1
</p><p>The one-child policy has had three important consequences for China's demographics: it reduced the fertility rate considerably, it skewed China's gender ratio because people preferred to abort or abandon their female babies, and resulted in a labor shortage due to more seniors who rely on their children to take care of them.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><br />

                            18. pa answer po The Promise of the Redeemer    Yahweh God said to the serpent, “Since you have done that, be cursed among all the cattle and wild beasts! You will crawl on your belly an eat dust all the days of your life. I will make you enemies, you and the woman, your offspring. He will crush your head and you will strike his heel.”    To the woman, God said “I will increase your suffering in childbearing, and you will give birth to your children in pain. You will be dependent on your husband and he will lord it over you.”     To the man, He said, because you have listened to your wife, and have eaten from the tree of which I forbade you to eat, cursed be the soil because of you! In suffering you will provide food for yourself from it, all the days of your life. It will produce thorn and thistle for you and you will eat the plants of the field. With sweat on your face you will eat your bread, until you return to clay, since it was from clay that you were taken, for you are dust and to dust you shall return.”    The man called his wife by the name of Eve, because she was the mother of all the living. Yahweh god made garments of skin for the man and his wife, and with these he clothed them. Then Yahweh god said, “man has become like one of us, making himself judge of good and evil. Let him stretch out his hand to take and eat from the tree of Life as well, and live forever.” So God cast him from the Garden of Eden to toil the soil from which he had been made. And after having driven the man out, god posted Cherubim and a flaming sword that kept turning at the east of the Garden of Eden to guard the way to the tree of LifeAnswer the following questions1 What did God say to the serpent after tempting the woman to disobey his command of not eating the forbidden fruit?2 What did God say to the woman after she had disobeyed command?3 What was the punishment God gave to the man?4 Why did God call the woman Eve?5 What prompted God to promise a Messiah or Redeemer to man ? (Adam and Eve)​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1.) He said that the serpent will crawl on his belly and eat dust all his life. </p><p></p><p>2.)

Pregnancy and childbirth complications are the leading cause of death among girls aged 15–19 years globally, with low- and middle-income countries accounting for 99% of global maternal deaths of women aged 15–49 years.3 Adolescent mothers aged 10–19 years face higher risks of eclampsia, puerperal endometritis and systemic infections than women aged 20–24 years. 4 Additionally, some 3.9 million unsafe abortions among girls aged 15–19 years occur each year, contributing to maternal mortality, morbidity and lasting health problems.1</p><br />
