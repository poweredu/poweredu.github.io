The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

A concept paper is a summary document of a project proposal that tells what the projectis all about the reasons for conducting the project and how it will be carried out.2. It is use to obtain informal feedback on the ideas prior to preparing the full proposal.3. Another use of a concept paper is it serves as foundation of the full proposal4. It can also help in addressing social issues which plague our society.The parts of a concept paper may also vary depending on the nature of the project/activitywhen it is used in a specific discipline.6. A concept paper is an academic writing which aims to provide a summary document ofwhar a project or research is all about prior to its actual implementation or funding7.

                                            1. The base sequence of the gene coding for a short polypeptide is CTACGCTAGGCGATTGACT. What would be the base sequence of the mRNA transcribed from this gene? Using the genetic code table below, give the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide translated from this mRNA. 
2. Researchers on the Human Genome Project have determined the nucleotide sequences of human genes and in many cases identified the proteins encoded by the genes. Knowledge of the nucleotide sequences of genes might be used to develop lifesaving medicines or treatments for genetic defects. In the United States, both government agencies and biotechnology companies have applied for patents on their discoveries of genes. In Britain, the courts have ruled that a naturally occurring gene cannot be patented. Do you think individuals and companies should be able to patent genes and gene products? Before answering. Consider the following: What are the purposes of a patent? How might the discoverer of a gene benefit from a patent? How might the public benefit? What might be some positive and negative results of patenting genes?
3. A mutation in a single gene may cause a major change in the body of a fruit fly, such as an extra pair of legs or wings. Yet, it probably takes the combined action of hundreds or thousands of genes to produce a wing or leg. How can a change in just one gene such a big change in the body?
4. A chemical called dioxin is produced as a by-product of some chemical manufacturing process. This substance was present in Agent Orange, a defoliant sprayed on vegetation during the Vietnam War. This has been a continuing controversy over its effects on soldiers exposed to it during the war. Animal tests have suggested that dioxin can be lethal and can cause birth defects, cancer organ damage, and immune system suppression. But its effects on humans are unclear, and even animal tests are inconclusive. Researchers have discovered that dioxin enters a cell and binds to a protein that in turn, attaches to the cell’s DNA. How might this mechanism help explain the variety of dioxin’s effects? How might you determine whether a particular individual became ill as a result of exposure to dioxin?

Abstract​)ENGLISH FOR ACADEMIC AND PROFESSIONAL PURPOSESWhat I know:1.B 4.A2.D 5.B3.C 6.AWhat’s New:obesity, poverty, climate change, drugs, bullyingWhat’s More:1.The issue is about how technology has changed people’s lives, behavior and moral outlook.The writer’s stand: He is not against technological developments in fact it improves man’s way of living, but he also reminds us that same technology will advance evil and harm. Therefore, use technology wisely for the common good.2. At the comfort of technological products man has found his comfort zone to dwell and slowly forgetting the value of real human interactions that eventually changes man’s mind, culture and outlook in life.3. Personal experienceReal-life scenario happening around4. The author reiterates his stand about the issue and leave a strong statement for a call to action.What I have Learned: I thought that figures of speech are tools that writers use to create images, or paint pictures, in the mind.I learned that I need to study hard in my module and I was surprised that I need to answer it directly and properly, thanks all of the teachers to give this lesson.What I can do: ( no answers )Lesson 2What’s More: (no answers)What I have Learned:POSITION PAPERCHOSEN ISSUE» Has the covid19 pandemic changed the world for its best or for its worst?TITLE» The Devastating Effects of COVID 19 Pandemic «ANSWERPosition: The Covid19 pandemic changed the world for its worstThe world these past 7 months, is experiencing one of the darkest times of its dense history because of the abrupt existence of a very detrimental COVID19 (Corona Virus Disease 2019) that originated in Wuhan, China, due to human negligence and lack of sanitation.This virus is very much contagious, that is why it became a global epidemic (occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually affecting a large number of people) in just 3 months! The Philippine government didn’t impose travel bans and stringent safety protocols fast enough to prevent the virus from entering the country, the slacking and inattentiveness of the government caused some massive consequences to the entire nation.Since the Philippines is only a developing country or a so-called third-world country, the government could not very much contain the effects of the deadly pandemic, imposing lockdowns and keeping people to go out of their houses and huddling together were not enough to prevent more than 8,500 people to perish within 8 months and a worldwide death or 2.1 million people.Note: Please do expound this position paper, I already provided the most important parts, you just have to add more to strengthen your position regarding the issue.Assesment:1.TRUE2.TRUE 3.TRUE4.TRUE5.FALSE6.TRUE7.FALSE8.TRUE9.TRUE10.TRUEII.1.a position paper presents one side of an arguable opinion about an issue.

NARRATIVE TEXT Purpose: Essentially, the purpose of narrative text is to tell a story. That said, there can be many reasons for story telling in the first place, for example, myths can be told to explain natural phenomena and legends can be used to pass on cultural beliefs. Storytelling itself is a means to entertain and inform readers and allows for the writer to express themselves creatively and imaginatively. There are many types of narrative text, including myths, fables, traditional tales, novels, short stories etc. 2. EXPLANATORY TEXT Purpose: It moves beyond providing straightforward descriptions to looking at things like causes and reasons. They move beyond a retelling of what happened such as in a simple report, to address the why and how of what happened. 3. EXPOSITORY TEXT Purpose: It exists to provide facts in a way that is educational and purposeful.The text is fact-based with the purpose of exposing the truth through a reliable source. It focuses on educating its reader. Its purpose is not primarily to amuse, but to enlighten and instruct. The objective is to explain and analyze information by presenting an idea, relevant evidence, and appropriate discussion. 4. Factual/Personal Recount Purpose: Recounts focus on retelling events and are generally intended to inform and/or entertain. 5. Persuasive Text Purpose: Its purpose is to convince the reader of the merits of adopting a particular viewpoint or taking a specific course of action ​</h2><br />

                            16. 1. The base sequence of the gene coding for a short polypeptide is CTACGCTAGGCGATTGACT. What would be the base sequence of the mRNA transcribed from this gene? Using the genetic code table below, give the amino acid sequence of the polypeptide translated from this mRNA. 
2. Researchers on the Human Genome Project have determined the nucleotide sequences of human genes and in many cases identified the proteins encoded by the genes. Knowledge of the nucleotide sequences of genes might be used to develop lifesaving medicines or treatments for genetic defects. In the United States, both government agencies and biotechnology companies have applied for patents on their discoveries of genes. In Britain, the courts have ruled that a naturally occurring gene cannot be patented. Do you think individuals and companies should be able to patent genes and gene products? Before answering. Consider the following: What are the purposes of a patent? How might the discoverer of a gene benefit from a patent? How might the public benefit? What might be some positive and negative results of patenting genes?
3. A mutation in a single gene may cause a major change in the body of a fruit fly, such as an extra pair of legs or wings. Yet, it probably takes the combined action of hundreds or thousands of genes to produce a wing or leg. How can a change in just one gene such a big change in the body?
4. A chemical called dioxin is produced as a by-product of some chemical manufacturing process. This substance was present in Agent Orange, a defoliant sprayed on vegetation during the Vietnam War. This has been a continuing controversy over its effects on soldiers exposed to it during the war. Animal tests have suggested that dioxin can be lethal and can cause birth defects, cancer organ damage, and immune system suppression. But its effects on humans are unclear, and even animal tests are inconclusive. Researchers have discovered that dioxin enters a cell and binds to a protein that in turn, attaches to the cell’s DNA. How might this mechanism help explain the variety of dioxin’s effects? How might you determine whether a particular individual became ill as a result of exposure to dioxin?
