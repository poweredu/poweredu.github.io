                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Any new technology will have early adopters. In India, with low educational levels,ICT would be the medium to reach the vast population at affordable cost. ICT in education is likely to have better assimilation as students are open to adopting and learning new things. http://aaqua.org/ is a website which helps farmers to have their immediate problems solved by agricultural experts remotely. These days mobile cameras capture pictures of a pest and the expert can view it and immediately suggest a solution or protocol to be followed. Similarly, http://www.classle.net/ is a social learning forum for students in rural areas who do not have access to quality resources. Both are spreading rapidly giving credence that ICT will be making a big impact for rural transformation.</p><br />
