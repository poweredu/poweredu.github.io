The TGV (Train a Grande Vitese: French for very high speed) is France's national high speed rail service. On April 3, 2007, a TGV mid-2011, TGV trains operated at the highest speed in passenger train service in the world, regularly 200 miles per hour. But what you may find most shocking is that TGV trains run on electric power or not petrol. Now if you'll excuse me; I have a record to catch. 1. Main Idea related title for the passage:2.

It must be a circustrain! One of the first uses of the circus train is credited to W.C. Coup. He partneredwith P.T. Barnum in 1871 to expand the reach of their newly combined shows usinglocomotives. Before circus trains, these operators had to lug around all of theiranimals, performers, and equipment with a team of more than 600 horses. Sincethere were no highways, these voyages were rough and took a long time. Circusesthese small towns was not very profitable. Because of these limitations, circusesAdditional ActivitiesTry to answer this worksheet.
