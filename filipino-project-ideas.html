                                            Learning Task 1: Read and analyze the statements. Differentiate the statements. Statement ! The purpose of the project was to determine if Vitamin A tablet have any effect on tomato plants. A total of twelve Rutgers tomato plants each two inches tall were planted in identical individual plastic pots using two cups of potting soil. Each plant received the same amount of water and sunlight during the three week experiment. The twelve plants were divided into four groups of three plants each. One vitamin A tablet was added to each of the three plants in the first group by burying the tablet one inch from the stem and one inch deep. Two vitamin A tablets were added to the second group of three plants in a similar manner. The third group of three plants had three tablets planted in the soil. The fourth group of three plants had no vitamin A tablets added to the soil and served as the control group. The height of each plant was measured and recorded at the start of the experiment and every 7 days thereafter. At the end of the experiment (21 days) the stems were cut across at a height of 3 inches. Experimental groups showed less development and slower growth rates than plants in the control group. The data was analyzed and the conclusion was drawn that giving vitamin A tablets to tomato plants did not improve growth as each of the three experimental groups failed to produce plants that were taller or had thicker stems than those in the control group. Statement ! A device invented by a 14-year-old Filipino hig school student harvests energy from simply walkin Camarines Sur National High School Grade student Modesto Remo Jr. invented the device th generates 6 watts of power from seven minutes walking. The device is also Bluetooth-capable, whi allows it to send information to a smart phon According to Remo, he had the idea to develop th device two years ago in a bid to find alternati sources of energy Guide Question: 3 points each 1.

                        Project name: Paper Mache Lampshade<br />Primary material to reuse: Old newspapers<br />Target output: Lampshade for a table lamp<br />Problem to be solved: Old newspapers taking up space and contributing to waste accumulation<br /><br />Procedure:<br /><br />1. Collect old newspapers that are no longer in use.<br />2. Tear the newspapers into small pieces and soak them in water for a few hours.<br />3. Squeeze out the excess water and mix the paper pieces with a glue solution (water and glue mixed in equal parts).<br />4. Form the paper mache mixture into the shape of a lampshade, using a balloon or any other mold as a guide.<br />5. Let the paper mache dry completely for a few days.<br />6. Once dry, pop the balloon or remove the mold and trim the edges of the lampshade to your desired shape.<br />7. Paint or decorate the lampshade according to your preference.<br />8. Attach the lampshade to a table lamp and enjoy your new creation!<br /><br />Guide Questions:<br />1. What is your basis for choosing the material to reuse?<br />-My basis for choosing the material to reuse is its abundance and availability in my surroundings. Old newspapers are often found in many households and offices, and they are also lightweight and easy to work with.<br />2. What is your basis for choosing the target product to create out of the chosen material?<br />-My basis for choosing the target product is its practical use and the possibility of creating a visually appealing object out of old newspapers. A lampshade is a functional item that can add a touch of personality to a room, and it can also serve as a conversation starter for guests.<br />3. What do you think is the benefit you can get out of reusing worn-out materials in your surroundings?<br />-Reusing worn-out materials can help reduce waste and promote sustainability. By repurposing old items, we can also save money and resources that would otherwise be spent on buying new things. Additionally, the process of reusing and creating something new can be a fun and creative activity that promotes resourcefulness and innovation.<br />

                            13. Learning Task 1: Read and analyze the statements. Differentiate the statements. Statement ! The purpose of the project was to determine if Vitamin A tablet have any effect on tomato plants. A total of twelve Rutgers tomato plants each two inches tall were planted in identical individual plastic pots using two cups of potting soil. Each plant received the same amount of water and sunlight during the three week experiment. The twelve plants were divided into four groups of three plants each. One vitamin A tablet was added to each of the three plants in the first group by burying the tablet one inch from the stem and one inch deep. Two vitamin A tablets were added to the second group of three plants in a similar manner. The third group of three plants had three tablets planted in the soil. The fourth group of three plants had no vitamin A tablets added to the soil and served as the control group. The height of each plant was measured and recorded at the start of the experiment and every 7 days thereafter. At the end of the experiment (21 days) the stems were cut across at a height of 3 inches. Experimental groups showed less development and slower growth rates than plants in the control group. The data was analyzed and the conclusion was drawn that giving vitamin A tablets to tomato plants did not improve growth as each of the three experimental groups failed to produce plants that were taller or had thicker stems than those in the control group. Statement ! A device invented by a 14-year-old Filipino hig school student harvests energy from simply walkin Camarines Sur National High School Grade student Modesto Remo Jr. invented the device th generates 6 watts of power from seven minutes walking. The device is also Bluetooth-capable, whi allows it to send information to a smart phon According to Remo, he had the idea to develop th device two years ago in a bid to find alternati sources of energy Guide Question: 3 points each 1.
