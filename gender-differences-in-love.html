                                            LGBT community is like our religion. We have our own differences, our own ideologies or perspectives and we have our own practices and knowledge about our beliefs but because of that, we're united. Just like LGBT, we have different viewpoints in life but we are equal. Those who have differences make the society whole. We all have the same gender which were the boys and girls and that's why we support them. By supporting them, we can actually promote equality in order to help them to gain confidence in their lives. They are being discriminated, being hated, being bashed, and people makes a lot of judgement to them. But what if you were in their shoes? Would you rather be fake or be true in yourself and make differences. If they are not allowed to enter in heaven or to be part of the community, then why did Jesus or our God created them? Why did He gave them life to exist? Why did he gave them some special gifts? That's because God loves us no matter what or who we are. Those people who judge them and belittle them are the ones who doesn't deserve to be part of the community and in heaven. Just because they are normal, they are allowed to discriminate and judge people according to their perspectives. They are not just the ones who belongs in the community. Being normal is boring but being normal who supports LGBT is interesting. LGBT may be different but they are just like our religion, we have differences but we believe in the same God. We believe that we are equal and no religion is superior than others. No religion judge the practices and the faith of others. We all know that God only created man and woman. But we must accept and love those who makes differences. We must understand them for truly God loves us all. And we supporters, will truly accept, understand, and love them.Pa help po pwede pa summary po Thank you ​</a>

                                            pa-summarize poRELATD STUDIES (LOCAL)The Philippines has earned its ranking as one of few gay-friendly countries in the world (Tubeza, 2013). A global survey said that Philippines say that homosexuality should be accepted in society (Pew Research Center, 2013). Despite its religiosity, the Philippines is one of the countries in the world where the level of public “acceptance” of homosexuals is high, according to the results of the survey (Statista, 2016). According to the survey, 78% of those aged 18-29 who interviewed said that gays should be accepted. 71 percent for those aged 30-49, and 68 percent for those 50 years old and above. A survey published by Statista Research Department in 2016, over 60 percent of the respondents do personally know are LGBT. However, only 25% of the respondents says that they support the legalization of same sex marriage. The Social Weather Survey also had the same result, 61% of their respondents says that they are disagree of legalization of same-sex marriage. Based on the result of the study of Ocampo (2016), LGBTQ members agreed that going through the phase of being confused to bisexual was hard for them at first and yet as they accept themselves and from the people around them, they became comfortable of whom they are. But discrimination cannot be prevented in their life as a bisexual such as insults or getting teased. They had experienced discrimination everywhere.In School, some teachers appeared to impose their own personal values and used institutional rules to suppress people’s gender expression, including giving students lower grades than they deserved (IGLHRC, 2013). Many of the LGBT women said they felt pressured to alter their preferred gender expression while at school and while wearing school uniforms. They reported that some officials explicitly sought to change their behavior. However, according to the UNDP, USAID (2014), the Department of Education in 2012 issued an order to protect children from violence, abuse and exploitation regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity which protects their rights as students. Some also said that even in their workplace, they have experienced discrimination. Despite being educated and have better qualification, they are often denied because of their gender (IGLHRC 2013). The UNDP, USAID (2014) also said that the employers sometimes take advantage of LGBT employees. Sexual harassment of LGBT employees was reported.In addition, Ocampo (2016), the LGBT people became more open minded and got more friends same as their sexuality for being a bisexual. However, Ocampo added that being different from others did not stop them from showing their true selves for there are people who would still accept and love them for who they are.LGBTQ also experienced violence inside and outside of their family. According to International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (2013), they have experienced different violence such as physical, Verbal and Emotional Violence, Violence in the Name of Religion, Violence in Schools and Sexual violence. They’ve experienced this kind of violence are largely came from their own family members, significant others or ex-partners, co-workers, and strangers (International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 2013).​</a>

Chivalry, chivalry, chivalryThey say it's the way to treat a ladyProtect and serve them like in the army Defend for them with commitment and fidelityIt was expected from a knight and all the gents eventually Deal with different people with utmost morality Be a gentleman and act with decency Particularly with women, so soft and daintyWith time it was charmed as an expectancy For males to be tough but with a sense of modesty In expressing affection and their utmost loyalty To the one, they will love all through eternityQuestions :1. What literary devices are used in the poem?2. How are the expressions of love in the drama 'Romeo and Juliet' and the poem similar and/or different?3. Do you think the idea of chivalry is a bias toward the female gender? Justify your answer.​</h2><br />
                        1. Metaphor, Symbolism, rhyme2. The difference in expressing love between the drama "Romeo and Juliet" and this poem is that in this poem -- the man is the only one who indicates a strong feeling of love toward his lady; while in "Romeo and Juliet," both of the main character loved each other through eternity and death.3. for me, YES, the notion of chivalry should possess both lovers and not just the man. We all grew up in a world where the act of Chivalry should only be acquired by a man. If both entourage this sentiment, then their relationship will grow stronger and healthier.<p></p><br />

                            26. LGBT community is like our religion. We have our own differences, our own ideologies or perspectives and we have our own practices and knowledge about our beliefs but because of that, we're united. Just like LGBT, we have different viewpoints in life but we are equal. Those who have differences make the society whole. We all have the same gender which were the boys and girls and that's why we support them. By supporting them, we can actually promote equality in order to help them to gain confidence in their lives. They are being discriminated, being hated, being bashed, and people makes a lot of judgement to them. But what if you were in their shoes? Would you rather be fake or be true in yourself and make differences. If they are not allowed to enter in heaven or to be part of the community, then why did Jesus or our God created them? Why did He gave them life to exist? Why did he gave them some special gifts? That's because God loves us no matter what or who we are. Those people who judge them and belittle them are the ones who doesn't deserve to be part of the community and in heaven. Just because they are normal, they are allowed to discriminate and judge people according to their perspectives. They are not just the ones who belongs in the community. Being normal is boring but being normal who supports LGBT is interesting. LGBT may be different but they are just like our religion, we have differences but we believe in the same God. We believe that we are equal and no religion is superior than others. No religion judge the practices and the faith of others. We all know that God only created man and woman. But we must accept and love those who makes differences. We must understand them for truly God loves us all. And we supporters, will truly accept, understand, and love them.Pa help po pwede pa summary po Thank you ​</h2><br />
                        <p>so the LGBT community have different views in life and even with that we still believe in the same God. But because of other people who underestimate the uniqueness of others, a lot of people are harmed because of this and a lot are starting to be ashamed of themselves as well. We need to start accepting one another and appreciating each other's differences and uniqueness because these qualities were given to us by God. It is our job to spread positivity around us especially to those part of the LGBT community who are suffering from the public. </p><p>I hope this helped :)</p><br />

                            30. pa-summarize poRELATD STUDIES (LOCAL)The Philippines has earned its ranking as one of few gay-friendly countries in the world (Tubeza, 2013). A global survey said that Philippines say that homosexuality should be accepted in society (Pew Research Center, 2013). Despite its religiosity, the Philippines is one of the countries in the world where the level of public “acceptance” of homosexuals is high, according to the results of the survey (Statista, 2016). According to the survey, 78% of those aged 18-29 who interviewed said that gays should be accepted. 71 percent for those aged 30-49, and 68 percent for those 50 years old and above. A survey published by Statista Research Department in 2016, over 60 percent of the respondents do personally know are LGBT. However, only 25% of the respondents says that they support the legalization of same sex marriage. The Social Weather Survey also had the same result, 61% of their respondents says that they are disagree of legalization of same-sex marriage. Based on the result of the study of Ocampo (2016), LGBTQ members agreed that going through the phase of being confused to bisexual was hard for them at first and yet as they accept themselves and from the people around them, they became comfortable of whom they are. But discrimination cannot be prevented in their life as a bisexual such as insults or getting teased. They had experienced discrimination everywhere.In School, some teachers appeared to impose their own personal values and used institutional rules to suppress people’s gender expression, including giving students lower grades than they deserved (IGLHRC, 2013). Many of the LGBT women said they felt pressured to alter their preferred gender expression while at school and while wearing school uniforms. They reported that some officials explicitly sought to change their behavior. However, according to the UNDP, USAID (2014), the Department of Education in 2012 issued an order to protect children from violence, abuse and exploitation regardless of sexual orientation and gender identity which protects their rights as students. Some also said that even in their workplace, they have experienced discrimination. Despite being educated and have better qualification, they are often denied because of their gender (IGLHRC 2013). The UNDP, USAID (2014) also said that the employers sometimes take advantage of LGBT employees. Sexual harassment of LGBT employees was reported.In addition, Ocampo (2016), the LGBT people became more open minded and got more friends same as their sexuality for being a bisexual. However, Ocampo added that being different from others did not stop them from showing their true selves for there are people who would still accept and love them for who they are.LGBTQ also experienced violence inside and outside of their family. According to International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission (2013), they have experienced different violence such as physical, Verbal and Emotional Violence, Violence in the Name of Religion, Violence in Schools and Sexual violence. They’ve experienced this kind of violence are largely came from their own family members, significant others or ex-partners, co-workers, and strangers (International Gay and Lesbian Human Rights Commission 2013).​</h2><br />
