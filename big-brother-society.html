1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.

say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."

he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia

family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While
gathering wood, Rosa was snatched by three Japanese soldiers. She survived the
incident because a farmer brought her home to recover. Two years after, an even
more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.
7. Life is beautiful.
Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,
mannerisms, outfits, and ideas stun her family and friends. This causes emotional
unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what
looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.
10. The life of Maria Rosa Henson or “Lola Rosa” classically depicts the cruelty of
poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own
illustrations and vivid descriptions of people and events long gone. Her story begins
as the daughter of the landlord’s illiterate mistress, Julia. Rosa’s mother, Julia, is the
eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.

                            6. Tell whether these could be influenced by culture, history, environment or
economic factors.
A. culture B. history C. economic D. environment
1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."
"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s
family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While
gathering wood, Rosa was snatched by three Japanese soldiers. She survived the
incident because a farmer brought her home to recover. Two years after, an even
more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.
7. Life is beautiful.
Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,
mannerisms, outfits, and ideas stun her family and friends. This causes emotional
unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what
looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.
10. The life of Maria Rosa Henson or “Lola Rosa” classically depicts the cruelty of
poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own
illustrations and vivid descriptions of people and events long gone. Her story begins
as the daughter of the landlord’s illiterate mistress, Julia. Rosa’s mother, Julia, is the
eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.
