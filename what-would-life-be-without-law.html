Americans (can/could) perform many daily tasks easily because tools to simplify life are widely available. 3.

Now, people (can/could) use computers to view their accounts and pay their bills 5. With the right computer software, people (may/might) do their own taxes rather than hire accountants to do it for them. 6. Because tax laws are constantly changing, software (shouldwould) continue to become more sophisticated in communicating these changes.7. Chores around the house (can/could) also take longer if people didn't have more efficient appliances 8. What kitchen (will/would) be complete without a dishwasher or microwave? 9.

                                            Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</a>

"It's only that a man must have a child.2. "I have prayed to Kabunyan much. I have sacrificed many chickens in myprayers."3. You remember how angry you were once when you came home from yourwork in the terrace because I butchered one of our pigs without your permission? I did it to appeaseKabunyan, because, like you, I wanted to have a child. But what could I do?"4."This house is yours," he said. "I built it for you. Make it your own, live in it aslong as you wish. I will build another house for Madulimay."5."Lumnay," he said tenderly. "Lumnay, if I did this it is because of my need fora child. You know that life is not worth living without a child. The man has mocked me behind my back.You know that."6. What was it that made a man wish for a child? What was it in life, in the workin the field, in the planting and harvest, in the silence of the night, in the communing with husband andwife, in the whole life of the tribe itself that made man wish for the laughter and speech of a child? Supposehe changed his mind? Why did the unwritten law demand, anyway, that a man, to be a man, must have achild to come after him?7. Suddenly she found courage. She would go to the dance. She would go to thechief of the village, to the elders, to tell them it was not right. Awiyao was hers; nobody could take himaway from her. Let her be the first woman to complain, to denounce the unwritten rule that a man maytake another woman.8. She made for the other side of the village where the dancing was. There was aflaming glow over the whole place; a great bonfire was burning. The gangsas clamored more loudly now,and it seemed they were calling to her. She was near at last. She could see the dancers clearly now. Theman leaped lightly with their gangsas as they circled the dancing women decked in feast garments andbeads, tripping on the ground like graceful birds, following their men.9. The flames of the bonfire leaped in countless sparks which spread and roselike yellow points and died out in the night. The blaze reached out to her like a spreading radiance. Shedid not have the courage to break into the wedding feast.10. Lumnay thought of Awiyao as the Awiyao she had known long ago-- a strong,muscular boy carrying his heavy loads of fuel logs down the mountains to his home. She had met him oneday as she was on her way to fill her clay jars with water. He had stopped at the spring to drink and rest;and she had made him drink the cool mountain water from her coconut shell. After that it did not take himlong to decide to throw his spear on the stairs of her father's house in token on his desire to marry her plisssssssssssss I need today​</a>

It is the inspiration of the family and an inviolable social institution.         The Family Code of the Philippines sets eighteen (18) as the age of maturity of the Filipinos. However, for marriages between the age of 18 to 21, the written consent of the parent is required. Without the written consent, the marriage is voidable.        A person who is between the ages 21-25 is obliged to ask their parents or guardian for advice and has got to make a sworn statement that advice was sought and given. If there's no parental advice or if the advice is unfavorable, the wedding license is issued only after three months after the publication of the appliance for the license.       The marriage of persons who are below 18 years of aged is void (not lawful, not legal) and thus, no true marriage happened.Guide Questions:1.

                                            The Wedding DanceAmador DaguioThe story is set in the mountains of northern Philippines, in a traditional community unspoiled by outsideinfluence. The story may have happened before or after the Second World War one summer night beforeharvest timeHeaAwiyao is a strong, muscular, industrious member of the tribe He'd been married to Lumnay for seven years yet without children He loves Luminaand was a good husband to her, but he is forced to take another wife as the laws of their society dictate. Lumnay is a tough, graceful woman whois also an industrious worker. She was a loving wife to Awiyao, but after the failure to give him an offspring, she has to suffer separation from thelove of her life. Madulimay is the woman chosen to be Awiyao's new wife. She holds the promise of the continuity of Awiyao's lineage. So here wehave a forced love triangle. On the night of the festivities for his second wedding, Awiyao visits his first wife Lumnay in the house he built for herAwiyao is worried that Lumnay is not among the wedding dancers. He invites her to the dance, but she remains still. He apologizes to her andexplains why the situation between them had to be this way. It is clear that they understood each other. They do not point fingers nor judge oneanother. Awiyao expresses his admiration and love for his wife and his regret for giving in to the pressure of producing an offspring. He encouragesLumnay to accept another husband Lumnay, however, is adamant and stands her ground - she will love only one man. Awiyao promises to comeback to her if he fails again for the second time, but Lumnay wishes him and his new wife only blessings from Kabunyan. She admits to him howdifficultthe situation is for her. When Awiyao is called back to the dance, he pauses as if to think over his decision. Lumnay accepts his invitation tothe dance and plucks up her courage to face her tribe, the joys of the past and the pains memories keep bringing her. But then, Lumnay stops toreflect on her fate questioning why they had to separate and plans to air her dissension to the tribe. However, she changes her mind and runs awafrom the ceremony toward the bean fields where she lingers for a long while to be with the beans, the produce she is able to breedLearning Task 1:After reading the excerpt, answer the following questions. Write your answers on your paper.1. What is the situation of Awiyao and Lumnay's marriage?2. How did Lumnay respond to Awiyao when he invited him to come to the wedding dance?3.What was expected of them during their time of marriage?

                                            Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

                                            EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 209 THE FAMILY CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES July 6, 1987 Marriage could also be a contract under seal of permanent union between a person and woman who entered into in accordance with law for the establishment of conjugal and family life. It is the inspiration of the family and an inviolable social institution. The Family Code of the Philippines sets eighteen (18) as the age of maturity of the Filipinos. However, for marriages between the age of 18 to 21, the written consent of the parent is required. Without the written consent, the marriage is voidable. A person who is between the ages 21-25 is obliged to ask their parents or guardian for advice and has got to make a sworn statement that advice was sought and given. If there's no parental advice or if the advice is unfavorable, the wedding license is issued only after three months after the publication of the appliance for the license. The marriage of persons who are below 18 years of aged is void (not lawful. not legal) and thus, no true marriage happened.1.what is the Republic act all about?2.if you were given a chance to revised any provision of the family code of the Philippines,what provision would you like to change?why?​</a>

                            6. Explanation: Gun powder revolutionized war and brought down old hierarchies and strategies after the introduction of the gun, war would never be the same. Similarly, the invention of the printing press allowed books and newspapers to reach vast audiences that otherwise had no access to the written word. This revolutionized education and made possible an era of widespread literacy and democratic thought. Example 2 Evolution is a blind giant who rolls a snowball down a hill. The ball is made of flakes-circumstances. They contribute to the mass without knowing it. They adhere without intention, and without foreseeing what is to result. When they see the result, they marvel at the monster ball and wonder how the contriving of it came to be originally thought out and planned. Whereas there was no such planning, there was only a law: the ball once started, all the circumstances that happened to lie in its path would help to build it, in spite of themselves." (Mark Twain, Tales of Wonder) Explanation: Here, Twain uses an analogy to speak about evolution, comparing it to a giant rolling a snowball down the hill-the results are quite unpredictable, but inevitable. In Popular Culture... Example 1 you never know what My mother always said "life is like a box of chocolates you're going to get!" (Forrest Gump) Explanation: Here, Forrest Gump shares a very memorable analogy, beginning with the simile "life was like a box of chocolates." But this is an analogy because it gives further support and explanation for the comparison, showing that life has many choices and surprises, just like a box of chocolate. Example 2 People are like stained-glass windows. They sparkle and shine when the sun is out, but when the darkness sets in, their true beauty is revealed only if there is a light from within. (Quote by Elisabeth Kübler-Ross in The Leader's Digest by Jim Clemmer, 2003) Explanation: In this quote, the groundbreaking psychiatrist Elizabeth Kübler-Ross (well-known for her 5 Stages of Grief) gives an analogy about the human condition, saying that people, like stained-glass, work differently in situations of light and dark.​</h2><br />

                            11. What's New Activity 1: An Act to Track            EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 209 THE FAMILY CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES                                      July 6, 1987         Marriage could also be a contract under seal of permanent union between a person and woman who entered into in accordance with law for the establishment of conjugal and family life. It is the inspiration of the family and an inviolable social institution.         The Family Code of the Philippines sets eighteen (18) as the age of maturity of the Filipinos. However, for marriages between the age of 18 to 21, the written consent of the parent is required. Without the written consent, the marriage is voidable.        A person who is between the ages 21-25 is obliged to ask their parents or guardian for advice and has got to make a sworn statement that advice was sought and given. If there's no parental advice or if the advice is unfavorable, the wedding license is issued only after three months after the publication of the appliance for the license.       The marriage of persons who are below 18 years of aged is void (not lawful, not legal) and thus, no true marriage happened.Guide Questions:1. What is the Republic Act all about2.If you were given the chance to revised any  provision of the Family Code of the Philippines, what provision would you like to change? Why?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A Republic Act is a piece of legislation used to create policy in order to carry out the principles of the Constitution.

                            13. story: The Wedding Dance Amador Daguio The story is set in the mountains of northern Philippines, in a traditional community unspoiled by outside influence. The story may have happened before or after the Second World War, one summer night before harvest time. Awiyaa is a strong, muscular, industrious member of the tribe. He'd been married to Lumnay for seven years yet without children. He loves Lumnay and was a good husband to her, but he is forced to take another wife as the laws of their society dictate. Lumnay is a tough, graceful woman who is also an Industrious worker.

                            15. EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 209 THE FAMILY CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES July 6, 1987 Marriage could also be a contract under seal of permanent union between a person and woman who entered into in accordance with law for the establishment of conjugal and family life. It is the inspiration of the family and an inviolable social institution. The Family Code of the Philippines sets eighteen (18) as the age of maturity of the Filipinos. However, for marriages between the age of 18 to 21, the written consent of the parent is required. Without the written consent, the marriage is voidable. A person who is between the ages 21-25 is obliged to ask their parents or guardian for advice and has got to make a sworn statement that advice was sought and given. If there's no parental advice or if the advice is unfavorable, the wedding license is issued only after three months after the publication of the appliance for the license. The marriage of persons who are below 18 years of aged is void (not lawful. not legal) and thus, no true marriage happened. 1.what is the Republic act all about? 2.if you were given a chance to revised any provision of the family code of the Philippines,what provision would you like to change?why?nonsence=report​</h2><br />

                            21. Activity 56: The Philippines’ Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020: Below explains what the bill exactly says and does:
   The Philippines' Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020
The Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 amends the Human Security Act of 2007. It expands the definition of terrorism to include acts intended to cause "death or serious bodily injury to any person," "extensive damage and destruction" to a government facility, private property or critical infrastructure and when the purpose of those acts is to "intimidate [the] general public," "create an atmosphere or message of fear," or "seriously destabilize or destroy the fundamental political, economic and social structures of the country." Those found guilty face life sentences without the chance of parole.
The act also criminalizes the "threat, planning, training, facilitating of" and "proposal" and "inciting" to terrorist activities by means of speeches, proclamations, writings, banners and emblems. It also subjects suspects to surveillance, warrantless arrest and detention for up to 24 days. In addition, it removes compensation for the suspect in the event of acquittal and boosts the Anti-Terrorism Council, the implementer of the law, whose members are appointed by the president.

   Meanwhile, the Philippines' Commission on Human Rights said the broad definition of "terrorism" in the bill "paves the road for possible abuse."
"By this broad definition, starting a fight in a bar could technically be classified as an act of terrorism," said Human Rights Watch, which called the act "a human rights disaster in the making."

She would go to thechief of the village, to the elders, to tell them it was not right. Awiyao was hers; nobody could take himaway from her. Let her be the first woman to complain, to denounce the unwritten rule that a man maytake another woman.8. She made for the other side of the village where the dancing was. There was aflaming glow over the whole place; a great bonfire was burning. The gangsas clamored more loudly now,and it seemed they were calling to her. She was near at last. She could see the dancers clearly now. Theman leaped lightly with their gangsas as they circled the dancing women decked in feast garments andbeads, tripping on the ground like graceful birds, following their men.9. The flames of the bonfire leaped in countless sparks which spread and roselike yellow points and died out in the night. The blaze reached out to her like a spreading radiance. Shedid not have the courage to break into the wedding feast.10. Lumnay thought of Awiyao as the Awiyao she had known long ago-- a strong,muscular boy carrying his heavy loads of fuel logs down the mountains to his home. She had met him oneday as she was on her way to fill her clay jars with water. He had stopped at the spring to drink and rest;and she had made him drink the cool mountain water from her coconut shell. After that it did not take himlong to decide to throw his spear on the stairs of her father's house in token on his desire to marry her.pls...pa help po thank you...​</h2><br />

                            27. EXECUTIVE ORDER NO. 209 THE FAMILY CODE OF THE PHILIPPINES July 6, 1987 Marriage could also be a contract under seal of permanent union between a person and woman who entered into in accordance with law for the establishment of conjugal and family life. It is the inspiration of the family and an inviolable social institution. The Family Code of the Philippines sets eighteen (18) as the age of maturity of the Filipinos. However, for marriages between the age of 18 to 21, the written consent of the parent is required. Without the written consent, the marriage is voidable. A person who is between the ages 21-25 is obliged to ask their parents or guardian for advice and has got to make a sworn statement that advice was sought and given. If there's no parental advice or if the advice is unfavorable, the wedding license is issued only after three months after the publication of the appliance for the license. The marriage of persons who are below 18 years of aged is void (not lawful. not legal) and thus, no true marriage happened.1.what is the Republic act all about?2.if you were given a chance to revised any provision of the family code of the Philippines,what provision would you like to change?why?​</h2><br />
