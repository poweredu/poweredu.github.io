A. Reading Text - Guugu Yimithirr—an unusual Australian language
Guugu Yimithirr is an indigenous Australian language, spoken in northern Queensland; the majority of speakers
live in the town of Hopevale. The English word ‘kangaroo’ originates from Guugu Yimithirr, but the language is perhaps
more notable for entirely lacking ‘egocentric’ directions. This means that there are no words for ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘backwards’
or ‘forwards’, and speakers of Guugu Yimithirr give directions exclusively using points of the compass. For example,
you might hear "Your pen is on the table, just north of the fruit bowl." While this sounds strange in English, a Guugu
Yimithirr speaker would see nothing odd about it. Linguists and anthropologists investigating this unusual trait
discovered that Guugu Yimithirr speakers use subtle environmental cues to orient themselves to the points of the
compass; specifically, they use the position of the sun, the position of landmarks, or the way that plants grow. In this
way, they are always aware of where north, south, east and west are, although they can temporarily lose this ability
if they move a large distance, for example if they fly to another region. A group of Guugu Yimithirr speakers who were
flown to Brisbane—a journey of around 2000km—were unable to identify compass directions for around one week
after their journey; thereafter, they became oriented and were able to communicate direction and position as they
usually would.

                                            Reusing Things Around YouFilipinos are known for being resourceful and creative. Filipinos can turn nothing into something through innovative ideas. How can you reuse things around you and turn them into something useful?Procedure:1. Try to identify materials that are not being used and serve no particular purpose. Examples are old visual materials or paper waste.2. Pick one material that will be the focus of your work.3. After identifying the object, think of a way how you can reuse the material that you picked by turning it into something that you can use for a specific purpose. An example is turning paper waste into paper charcoal.4. After brainstorming, summarize your plan by completing the table below.5. Present and give a brief description of your output in classProject name:Primary material to reuse:Target output:Problem to be solved:Procedure:Guide Questions:Briefly answer each question for the activity wrap-up assessment.1. What is your basis for choosing the material to reuse?2. What is your basis for choosing the target product to create out of the chosen material?3. What do you think is the benefit you can get out of reusing worn-out materials in your surroundings?Also please send a picture of your project, Thank you</a>

                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</a>

more notable for entirely lacking ‘egocentric’ directions. This means that there are no words for ‘left’, ‘right’, ‘backwards’
or ‘forwards’, and speakers of Guugu Yimithirr give directions exclusively using points of the compass. For example,
you might hear "Your pen is on the table, just north of the fruit bowl." While this sounds strange in English, a Guugu
Yimithirr speaker would see nothing odd about it. Linguists and anthropologists investigating this unusual trait
discovered that Guugu Yimithirr speakers use subtle environmental cues to orient themselves to the points of the
compass; specifically, they use the position of the sun, the position of landmarks, or the way that plants grow. In this
way, they are always aware of where north, south, east and west are, although they can temporarily lose this ability
if they move a large distance, for example if they fly to another region. A group of Guugu Yimithirr speakers who were
flown to Brisbane—a journey of around 2000km—were unable to identify compass directions for around one week
after their journey; thereafter, they became oriented and were able to communicate direction and position as they
usually would.

                            9. Reusing Things Around YouFilipinos are known for being resourceful and creative. Filipinos can turn nothing into something through innovative ideas. How can you reuse things around you and turn them into something useful?Procedure:1. Try to identify materials that are not being used and serve no particular purpose. Examples are old visual materials or paper waste.2. Pick one material that will be the focus of your work.3. After identifying the object, think of a way how you can reuse the material that you picked by turning it into something that you can use for a specific purpose. An example is turning paper waste into paper charcoal.4. After brainstorming, summarize your plan by completing the table below.5. Present and give a brief description of your output in classProject name:Primary material to reuse:Target output:Problem to be solved:Procedure:Guide Questions:Briefly answer each question for the activity wrap-up assessment.1. What is your basis for choosing the material to reuse?2. What is your basis for choosing the target product to create out of the chosen material?3. What do you think is the benefit you can get out of reusing worn-out materials in your surroundings?Also please send a picture of your project, Thank you</h2><br />
                        Project name: Paper Mache Lampshade<br />Primary material to reuse: Old newspapers<br />Target output: Lampshade for a table lamp<br />Problem to be solved: Old newspapers taking up space and contributing to waste accumulation<br /><br />Procedure:<br /><br />1. Collect old newspapers that are no longer in use.<br />2. Tear the newspapers into small pieces and soak them in water for a few hours.<br />3. Squeeze out the excess water and mix the paper pieces with a glue solution (water and glue mixed in equal parts).<br />4. Form the paper mache mixture into the shape of a lampshade, using a balloon or any other mold as a guide.<br />5. Let the paper mache dry completely for a few days.<br />6. Once dry, pop the balloon or remove the mold and trim the edges of the lampshade to your desired shape.<br />7. Paint or decorate the lampshade according to your preference.<br />8. Attach the lampshade to a table lamp and enjoy your new creation!<br /><br />Guide Questions:<br />1. What is your basis for choosing the material to reuse?<br />-My basis for choosing the material to reuse is its abundance and availability in my surroundings. Old newspapers are often found in many households and offices, and they are also lightweight and easy to work with.<br />2. What is your basis for choosing the target product to create out of the chosen material?<br />-My basis for choosing the target product is its practical use and the possibility of creating a visually appealing object out of old newspapers. A lampshade is a functional item that can add a touch of personality to a room, and it can also serve as a conversation starter for guests.<br />3. What do you think is the benefit you can get out of reusing worn-out materials in your surroundings?<br />-Reusing worn-out materials can help reduce waste and promote sustainability. By repurposing old items, we can also save money and resources that would otherwise be spent on buying new things. Additionally, the process of reusing and creating something new can be a fun and creative activity that promotes resourcefulness and innovation.<br />

                            10. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</h2><br />
