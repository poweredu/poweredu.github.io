Impressionism is more on suggesting a hazy mood rather than a solid reality. 2. Claude Monet is considered one of the moving forces of Impressionism in music. 3. While Debussy and Ravel's musical works sound quite similar in terms of their harmonic and textural characteristics, the two differed greatly in their personalities and approach to music. 4. A Millennial Junior High School student who adheres to exploratory styles Would prefer "Claire De Lune" to "Bolero". 5. Impressionism uses overlapping harmony which makes music easy to understand.​</a>

Hypo Stress is the opposite which is the results when the students bored by an unchallenged job such as working the same task over and over again. Because of these, students trapped as restlessness and lack of inspiration.​</a>

Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally, cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyberbullying. 2.

A plastic ban should be seriously and strictly implemented in the country. NGO-GAIA reported that the Philippines shocking amount of single-use plastic is nearly 60 billion sachets a year. These plastics greatly affect the environment especially when these get dumped in oceans and rivers as a habit practiced by the people in slum areas. It affects marine resources as it poisons and kills fishes and other marine life. Moreover, smoke from burned plastics is dangerous because it releases chemicals which can cause respiratory ailments. These are only a few alarming reasons why we should campaign for the removal of single-use plastics in the market.​</a>

Title: Perceived Motivational Factors of Senior High Teachers in Using Social Media and Its Effects on Senior High students in Pamplona National High School.findings 1. The researchers learned that having no time for opening social media application due to lots of tasks either academic or household chores is not the effect of integrating social media for educational purposes. 2. The most frequent reasons of teachers why they are motivated to use social media for educational purposes are- they just want to be updated on the school happenings and to communicate with other faculty members and school administrator, and if needed only in their concerns with tasks. Conclusions: 1. 2. Recommendations: 1. 2.Title: Stress Management Skills Under Pressure in Line With Computer Connections of CSS 11 &amp; 12 Students of Pamplona National High SchoolFindings:1. Most frequent stressors of the students are school related stressors, followed by personal factors such as the family issues, personal economic problems and inherent personality characteristics encompass the students' lives.2. Some students succumb into stress because of their looks. It lowered their self- confidence and self-esteem because of unfair treatment of the world and some are fall into insecurity which is the down cast.3. Work overload of the students result in Hyper Stress that pushes students beyond what they can handle. Little or simple things like school works trigger their emotional response that lead to serious emotional and physical repercussion. Hypo Stress is the opposite which is the results when the students bored by an unchallenged job such as working the same task over and over again. Because of these, students trapped as restlessness and lack of inspiration.​</h2><br />

Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally, cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyberbullying. 2.

It affects marine resources as it poisons and kills fishes and other marine life. Moreover, smoke from burned plastics is dangerous because it releases chemicals which can cause respiratory ailments.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The Seven Steps of the Research Process</p><p>• Identification of a research problem.</p><p>• Formulation of Hypothesis.</p><p>• Review of Related Literature.</p><p>• Preparation of Research Design.</p><p>• Actual experimentation.</p><p>• Results and Discussion.</p><p>• Formulation of Conclusions and Recommendations.</p><p></p><p>2. The main purposes of research are to inform action, gather evidence for theories, and contribute to developing knowledge in a field of study. This article discusses the significance of research and the many reasons why it is important for everyone—not just students and scientists.</p><p></p><p>3. This is the most common way of defining "ethics": norms for conduct that distinguish between acceptable and unacceptable behavior.</p><p></p><p>Most people learn ethical norms at home, at school, in church, or in other social settings. Although most people acquire their sense of right and wrong during childhood, moral development occurs throughout life and human beings pass through different stages of growth as they mature. Ethical norms are so ubiquitous that one might be tempted to regard them as simple commonsense. </p><p></p><p>4. Good research is replicable, reproducible, and transparent. Replicability, reproducibility, and transparency are some of the most important characteristics of research. The replicability of a research study is important because this allows other researchers to test the study's findings.</p><p></p><p>5. As a senior high school student I need to do research because</p><p>Studies reveal that research helps restore and protect memory and enhances mathematic and problem-solving skills. Therefore, it prepares the mind for a better understanding of concepts and theories. A person's learning capacity is improved and they can perform better in comparison who is reluctant to research.</p><p></p><br />
