                                            About the AuthorBj Patino or Bernard Julian is a master’s degree in literature graduate of the Ateneo de Manila University and also a faculty member of the English department of the same school. Some of his works include “Late Mourning” and “Ninth Day.” He is also a photojournalist of Mindanao News and Information Cooperative Center. He is currently working towards a master’s degree in anthropology. Apo on the Wall was written by Bj Patino and talks about a child’s point of view about his strict father and a hanging photo on the wall. This advocates reasonably close to the realization of giving importance on looking back at our past, moving forward through our present and ensuring the success of our future.Apo on the Wall by Bj Patino There’s this man’s photo on the wall Of my father’s office at home, you Know, where father brings his work, Where he doesn’t look strange Still wearing his green uniform And colored breast plates, where, To prove that he works hard, he Also brought a photo of his boss Whom he calls Apo, so Apo could You know, hang around on the wall Behind him and look over his shoulders To make sure he’s snappy and all. Father snapped at me once, caught me Sneaking around his office at home Looking at the stuff on his wall- handguns, Plaques, a sword, medals a rifle- Told me that was no place for a boy Only men, when he didn’t really Have to tell me because, you know, That photo of Apo on the wall was already Looking at me around, His eyes following me like he was That scary Jesus in the hallway, saying I know what you’re doingGuide Questions: 1. Who do you think is the author referring to as “Apo”? 2. What do you think is the job of the author’s father? 3. How was the father described in the poem? What type of father do you think is he? 4. How does the poem give you a glimpse of how Martial Law was like? How does that make you feel?</a>

</p><p>  I like the poem entitled Apo on the Wall of BJ Patino because it provides a glimpse of what martial law was like back then. It gives me also an idea of what kind of relationship the narrator has with his father. Reading between the lines has a lot more to say than understanding its literal meaning. It made me feel like I was there when it happened, like I witnessed what had happened. I made a vision that was like it. Although, I didn’t actually lived then, I wasn’t even formed yet, there is a connection deep down that made me appreciate the current regime. If I’ll make a constructive criticism and comparison between the time of Martial Law and the present Duterte Administration, there’s a huge difference. As of now, the people is living in free will unlike before that it was pure dictatorship leaving the Philippines in deep struggle, young or old, rich or poor. Not only that, our country was in enormous debt. Former president Ferdinand Marcos didn’t allocate the budget accordingly in the advantage of corrupt and dishonest government officials. Most of it was almost all stashed in his bank accounts in foreign countries together with his first lady, Imelda Marcos, who bought shoes, jewelries and garments that costs a fortune. But of course, he had made a couple of accomplishments that as of now, the people benefited such as The Philippine Heart Center and San Juanico Bridge. Within his reign, crime was down the track. Outlaws and those who tried to interrogate and get rid of him were put six feet under without even knowing and investigating. However, the people don’t seem to credit him much for that. It’s because he had cast more sufferings than getting them out of poverty and fulfilling all his propaganda. Cheating on the election was his issue too. It was a blood bath period.  Today, the people are quite happy of the new administration except for drug addicts and pushers based on a survey I’ve seen on television of a trusted news network. The current president Rodrigo Duterte is doing his work very well and accordingly. He is by far the best and gutsy president the Philippines has ever had.  He goes after drug lords and convicts the guilty, corrupt and dishonest politicians from the Senate and of those in higher to lower positions. He is bringing justice to the people as well as lessened criminality. Eventually, those people who do not believe in him and hated him for his vulgar language will turn to his side and realize that he is saving this generation, the coming and our children’s children from being ruined caused by illegal drugs – which is the root causes of almost all crimes. I didn’t mourn that my parents voted him in. They made the right choice and so far, no regrets have been made.  Going back to the poem, the message that I got from it was the perspective that the persona’s father have about Martial Law and what it means to be a man. The narrator was clearly juvenile and shallow. His curiosity was all in. His father once told him: that was no place for a boy, only men. The narrator thought, it means so he doesn’t roam around and touch his father’s things that may injure him. But by analyzing that statement, it probably means more than that, isn’t it?At his young age, he can’t fully understand what his father was really trying to mean, he can only interpret them literally.</p><p></p><p>i hope its help</p><br />

The poem made me feel that I was there when the Martial Law happened. ... The past is in the past but it must be looked back in order to have a better present, to avoid another mistakes.</p><p>4. Yes</p><p>5. It truly shows people how the martial law during Marcos’s regime affected the life of a certain Filipino child. I liked the poem simply because of the figurative languages he used to hide what he wanted us to visualize. Those metaphoric styles he injected for readers to think and read between the lines. Another reason why I liked the poem is because of the light words he used to make us think that these are real scenarios that happened in the life of child at his age during those times, which in reality is BJ Patino’s anecdote written as a poem. paki brainliest nalang po thanks :)</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            29. Who is apo in the poem? From the poem apo in the wall</h2><br />
                        As I read the title of the poem “Apo on the Wall”, the first thing that came into mind is who is this Apo?<br />The poem Apo on the wall is about how a little child keeps on loitering in his strict fathers room with a picture of his fathers boss hanging on a wall in the room. He says that the picture of Apo looks snappy and keep staring at you as though it is real.<br />I find the poem quite intriguing because the writer did not easily reveal the identity of Apo aside from being the boss of the child’s father and how it is scary similar to a picture of Jesus on a hallway. You can only imagine how powerful this Apo is being put on a wall in a room of a child’s father. And indeed the man Apo is powerful and he is none other than the famous Dictator himself, Ferdinand Marcos.<br />What I like and how I feel about the poem is that it gives us insights about the past through a little boys perspective. A past that is considered to be a dark one, a time where our country was engulfed by the Martial Law.<br />The poem imparts a message regarding the Martial Law. How during those times the people of the country had to follow strict orders, have their rights violated and how they were abused by power that was beyond their reach. It was a dark time of Filipinos where this past should not happen again. Being a past that should not happen again, this serves as a foundation for the present. Having a past which is considered dark can serve as a lesson for the future leaders not to implement a rather abusive method of leading ones country. This goes to show that our country has quite improved since those times and with the selection of a rather promising leader, the future of this country is in good hands, i dare say.<br /><br /><br /><br />APO ON THE WALL <br /><br />There’s this man’s photo on the wallOf my father’s office at home, youKnow, where father brings his work,Where he doesn’t look strangeStill wearing his green uniformAnd colored breast plates, where,To prove that he works hard, heAlso brought a photo of his bossWhom he calls Apo, so Apo couldYou know, hang around on the wallBehind him and look over his shouldersTo make sure he’s snappy and all.Father snapped at me once, caught meSneaking around his office at homeLooking at the stuff on his wall- handguns,Plaques, a sword, medals a rifle-Told me that was no place for a boyOnly men, when he didn’t reallyHave to tell me because, you know,That photo of Apo on the wall was alreadyLooking at me around,His eyes following me like he wasThat scary Jesus in the hallway, sayingI know what you’re doing.<br />
