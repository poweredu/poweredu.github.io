                                            By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</a>

                                            The Wooden BowlA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law,and four-year-old grandson. The old man's handstrembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered.The family ate together at the table. But the elderlygrandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eatingdifficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. Whenhe grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with themess. "We must do something about father," said theson. "I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating,and food on the floor." So the husband and wife set asmall table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alonewhile the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. SinceGrandfather had broken a dish or two, his food wasserved in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced inGrandfather's direction, sometimes he had a tear in hiseye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple hadfor him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a forkor spilled food.The four-year-old watched it all in silence.One evening before supper, the father noticed his sonplaying with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the childsweetly, "What are you making?" Just as sweetly, theboy responded, "Oh, I am making a little bowl for you andMama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.The words so struck the parents so that they werespeechless. Then tears started to stream down theircheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew whatmust be done.That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand andgently led him back to the family table. For the remainderof his day, he ate every meal with the family. And forsome reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to careany longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or thetablecloth soiled.QUESTIONS:1.

'Just as sweetly, the boy responded "Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work. The words so struck the parents so that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both know what must be done That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his day, he ate every meal with the family.

Filipino resilience: Family, Faith, and Fun (An Excerpt)
By Henry Manucia
Manila, Philippines- When Supper Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit Tacloban City on Nov. 8, 2013, the storm surge swept away the parents of seven-year-old boy. The tragedy did not just sweep his parents away from him, it took his voice as well.
We saw him four weeks later playing with a broken bike at the MacArthur Shrine. All that remained was the frail
body of seven-year-old boy whose faded eyes tried to hide a story so huge and too heavy to draw out. I greeted him and took his quick glance as a door that opened slightly to allow me into an incredible story of tragedy, survival, and anger.
The encounter with this young boy is by no means uncommon. Yet each story had always been unique in those
instances that we had purposely responded to human disasters and natural calamities in these past 1 years. In a calibrated response of rescue, relief and retrieval when calamities and disaster strikes, we would mobilize to
join the other teams in the field from 30 to 45 days after they hit the ground. What we had experienced in the field had taught us that the survivors are not the only ones affected by the
extraordinary experience. The tragedy of loss drains the survivors of their emotional capital. The gaping vacuum of human vitality and the unending stream of needs create a growing helplessness among the first responders. This easily replaces the energy that is sapped from them day after day. Apart from the survivors therefore, the responders are likewise affected in the aftermath of disasters and calamities.
This is the natural narrative of a people who are in the path of typhoons, whose land sits on an earthquake belt, and
whose cultural history is spiced by intrusions and invasion. Yet those who get a glimpse of this collage of colors on the
Philippine palette would gush in amazement at how resilient the Filipinos are.</a>

The was a very rich man who had two son. The first one was very obedient to her father while the second one is lazy. One day he asked his father for his share in his father property and went away leaving his father heart broken. He wasted hi money over useless things and was left penniless. Forcing him to work in a mean job. he thought about his father and how he tried him nicely.
His father who waited for him every single day saw his second son from the distant. the second son kneeled down. He said, "Father, I am not fit to be your son. Take me as your servant."
His father lifted him lovingly. He embraced him. He turned to his servants. He said, "Bring the best robe. Put
it on my son. Put a ning on his fingers and shoes on his feet. Kill the fatted call. Prepare a feast. Let us eat and enjoy.
My son was lost. Now he is found."
The first son came home and got angry but understood it. The father said "My dear son, you are always with me. All my property is yours. Your younger brother was
dead. Now he is alive. He was lost. Now he is found. Therefore should we not rejoice?"
The elder son understood the love behind the words of his father. He forgot everything about his younger
brother. He decided to take part in the celebration. He was happy.​</a>

I ran into a stranger as he passed by
"Oh excuse me, please" was my reply.
He said, "Please excuse me, too;
I wasn't even watching for you.
We went on our way and we said good-bye.
But at home a different story is told,
How we treat our loved ones, young and old.
Later that day, cooking the evening meal,
My daughter stood beside me very still.
When I turned around, I nearly knocked her down.
"Move out of my way," I said with a frown.
She walked away, her little heart broken.
I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.
While I lay awake in bed,
The voice of God came to me and said,
"While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use,
But the children you love, you seem to abuse.
Look on the kitchen floor,
You'll find some flowers there by the door,
Those are the flowers she brought for you.
She picked them herself, pink, yellow, and blue.
She stood quietly not to spoil the surprise,
And you never saw the tears in her eyes."
By this time I felt very small,
And now my tears began to fall.
I quietly went and knelt by her bed;
"Wake up little girl, wake up," I said.
"Are these the flowers you picked for me?​
 knew you'd like them, especially the blue."
I said, "Daughter, I am sorry for the way I did today,
I shouldn't have shout at you that way."
She said, "Oh Mommy that's okay
And I do like the flowers, especially the blue."​

The bird replied, "Yes, it is made of broken sticks, looks shabby and is open to the elements of nature. It is crude, but i built it, and i like it." "I guess it's just like any other nest, but not better than mine", said the tortoise. "You must be jealous of my shell, though." "On the contrary", the bird replied.

                                            The Wooden BowlA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and four-year old grandson. The old man's handstrembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at the table. But the elderlygrandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When hegrasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.The son and daughter-in-lawbecame irritated with the mess. "We must do something about father," said the son. "I've had enough of his spilledmilk, noisy eating, and food on the floor." So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There,Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, hisfood was served in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced in Grandfather's direction, sometime he had a tear inhis eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a forkor spilled food.The four-year-old watched it all in silence.One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked thechild sweetly, "What are you making?” Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for youand Mama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.The words so struck the parents so that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down theircheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done.That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table. For theremainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed tocare any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.Questions:1.What is the setting of the story?2.Who are the characters?3.What is the conflict?How it was resolved in the story?4.What is the theme?How it is applicable in our present situation?​</a>

                                            The short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson takes place a few hundred years ago on June 27 in a small town. The townspeople start the day as they normally would, but then at 10:00 all the residents had to report to the town square. Mr. Summers led the process. He brought with him a box with small pieces of paper inside of it. His first order of business was to take role and make sure he knew who was the head of each family and which members could not attend.  Mrs. Hutchinson arrived after he had been sworn in, declaring that she had forgotten what day it was to the amusement of those people who heard her. If the head male of the family were deceased or incapable of coming as in Clyde Dunbar's case due to a broken leg, then a son over the age of sixteen could stand in or the wife would have to pick for the family. As Mr. Summers called each family name, the representative would come forward and pick a piece of paper from the box without looking at it. While this process went on, some of the townspeople talked about how the north village was talking about giving up the lottery process. The older people in the crowd seemed to think that was ridiculous, saying "lottery in June, corn be heavy soon," but the younger members thought the idea had merit.  When Old Man Warner drew his slip, he declared it was his seventy-seventh time participating in the lottery. The last few people took their slips before everyone opened them. The crowd looked around wondering which family had the piece of paper with the black spot on it. It was Bill Hutchinson. Mrs. Dunbar told her oldest son to run and tell the news to his dad back at home.  Tessie Hutchinson immediately becomes defensive, saying her husband didn't have enough time, and it wasn't fair, but those around her encouraged her to calm down, including her husband who told her to shut her mouth. Then Mr. Summers focused in on the members of the Hutchinson family, which included Tessie and Bill along with their three children: Bill, Jr., Nancy, and Dave.  Since Dave was onl</a>

                            5. By Mr. Bun D. Tenorio Jr.Lifted from the book The Phoenix World of ReadingI have a story to tell. This is about a young boy I know. He was born poor to parents who were farmers. When he grew up, however, he was able to meet and mingle with kings and queens, presidents, and senators. No magic took place there. This is a real story. Because the kid was poor, he didn’t have a single toy. He would go to his neighbor’s house to use the toys of his playmates. In school, he barely had notebooks. Even if his mother couldn’t afford to buy him notebooks, this kid persevered to study. This boy was poor but rich in fighting spirit. Often he would go to school without allowance, wearing slippers and a tattered uniform. For breakfast, he would fill his glass of coffee with rice. For lunch, he would mash banana and steamed rice. For dinner, he and his brothers would share one fried egg, divided equally among them. One day, he came home with the sole of his foot bleeding. He stepped on a piece of broken glass and it pierced through his worn out slippers. “Nay, please buy me a pair of slippers,” the boy asked his mother. “Son, we don’t have any money. Just be careful the next time.”In time, all his wounds were healed. They left scars all over his body. He graduated from grade school with honors. He continued to study.He could not have studied in high school were if not for the elementary teachers who helped him get a scholarship. This kid was full of ambition, only he had no resources. So he could go to college, his mother offered a novena to God for him to pass the entrance examination of the University of the Philippines. God heard her prayers and this boy got a scholarship. He was given a monthly stipend and a book allowance, which he gave to his mother, so they could have money. Slowly but surely, his dreams were gradually being realized. The kid who imagined that he lived in a sandcastle became a writer. He met, mingled with, and wrote stories of people, the movers and shakers of the world that he thought only existed in the sandcastle of his dreamland.It may sound proud to listen to the story of the kid but this is the truth. He achieved this little success in life because he once dreamed that he would be able to buy pairs and pairs of slippers and shoes, that the wounds of the past would be healed, that there would be food on their table. To this day, this boy continues to dream.I am this kid.Who were the people who helped him pursue his dream in life? 'Where did he live when he was still a kid? Where did he finish his college degree? Where does he presently work?When did the author realize that his family was having financial problems?What particular situations can prove that the boy’s family was really poor?What kind of relationship does the author have with his siblings? Cite the reason behind your conclusion.Why did he not complain after being told by his mother that she couldn’t buy him a new pair of slippers?(The subject is Reading)</h2><br />

                            6. The Wooden BowlA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law,and four-year-old grandson. The old man's handstrembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered.The family ate together at the table. But the elderlygrandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eatingdifficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. Whenhe grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with themess. "We must do something about father," said theson. "I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating,and food on the floor." So the husband and wife set asmall table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alonewhile the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. SinceGrandfather had broken a dish or two, his food wasserved in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced inGrandfather's direction, sometimes he had a tear in hiseye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple hadfor him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a forkor spilled food.The four-year-old watched it all in silence.One evening before supper, the father noticed his sonplaying with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the childsweetly, "What are you making?" Just as sweetly, theboy responded, "Oh, I am making a little bowl for you andMama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.The words so struck the parents so that they werespeechless. Then tears started to stream down theircheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew whatmust be done.That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand andgently led him back to the family table. For the remainderof his day, he ate every meal with the family. And forsome reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to careany longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or thetablecloth soiled.QUESTIONS:1. If you were the old man in the story, how will you feelon how your son treat you?2. How should you treat your parents or elders in thefamily?3. What does this story teach you? pa answer po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.)</strong><strong> </strong>I would feel hurt, if my son treats me unfairly and I did not deserve it.  He should not be doing that to me because I am an old man, who needs love and care at my old age.  A young man who does not understand or appreciate me, might have to bear the same consequences when he is old as well.  His son might be treating him in the same way, and he might regret how poorly he had treated me when he gets old too.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.)</strong> You should treat your parents or elders in the family kindly and with respect. They are the foundation to the family's stability, and their wisdom can be passed down to you and benefit your life greatly. It is common for a child to treat his or her elders unfairly because the child does not know any better.  But the adult should understand the value of their family members, and should treat them kindly and with respect.  Kindness and respect are very effective tools for maintaining the peace in a family.  They are essential for all relationships, not just the ones with elders.</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>This story teaches me to treat my elders with respect and kindness.  It also teaches me that even the smallest of deeds can have the biggest impact.  If I treat my elders with respect, it might inspire them to treat me with respect as well.  We never know how our actions might affect others, so it is important to be respectful whenever possible. Also, being kind to others can make us feel good about ourselves.</p><br />

                            12. THE WOODEN BOWLA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law, and four-year-old grandson. The old man's hands trembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered. The family ate together at the table. But the elderly grandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eating difficult Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. When he grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with the mess. We must do something about father," said the son. "I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating, and food on the floor So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, his food was served in a wooden bowl! When the family glancod in Grandfather's direction sometimes he had a tear in his eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for a him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a fork or spilled food The four-year-old watched it all in silence One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor He asked the child sweetly, "What are you making?' 'Just as sweetly, the boy responded "Oh, I am making a little bowl for you and Mama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work. The words so struck the parents so that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down their cheeks. Though no word was spoken, both know what must be done That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table. For the remainder of his day, he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason neither husband nor wife seemed to care any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled or the tablecloth soiled.processing questions:1. Which story did you like most? Why?2.

Filipino resilience: Family, Faith, and Fun (An Excerpt)
By Henry Manucia
Manila, Philippines- When Supper Typhoon Yolanda (Haiyan) hit Tacloban City on Nov. 8, 2013, the storm surge swept away the parents of seven-year-old boy. The tragedy did not just sweep his parents away from him, it took his voice as well.
We saw him four weeks later playing with a broken bike at the MacArthur Shrine. All that remained was the frail
body of seven-year-old boy whose faded eyes tried to hide a story so huge and too heavy to draw out. I greeted him and took his quick glance as a door that opened slightly to allow me into an incredible story of tragedy, survival, and anger.
The encounter with this young boy is by no means uncommon. Yet each story had always been unique in those
instances that we had purposely responded to human disasters and natural calamities in these past 1 years. In a calibrated response of rescue, relief and retrieval when calamities and disaster strikes, we would mobilize to
join the other teams in the field from 30 to 45 days after they hit the ground. What we had experienced in the field had taught us that the survivors are not the only ones affected by the
extraordinary experience. The tragedy of loss drains the survivors of their emotional capital. The gaping vacuum of human vitality and the unending stream of needs create a growing helplessness among the first responders. This easily replaces the energy that is sapped from them day after day. Apart from the survivors therefore, the responders are likewise affected in the aftermath of disasters and calamities.
This is the natural narrative of a people who are in the path of typhoons, whose land sits on an earthquake belt, and
whose cultural history is spiced by intrusions and invasion. Yet those who get a glimpse of this collage of colors on the
Philippine palette would gush in amazement at how resilient the Filipinos are.</h2><br />

                            20. Author Unknown
I ran into a stranger as he passed by
"Oh excuse me, please" was my reply.
He said, "Please excuse me, too;
I wasn't even watching for you.
We went on our way and we said good-bye.
But at home a different story is told,
How we treat our loved ones, young and old.
Later that day, cooking the evening meal,
My daughter stood beside me very still.
When I turned around, I nearly knocked her down.
"Move out of my way," I said with a frown.
She walked away, her little heart broken.
I didn't realize how harshly I'd spoken.
While I lay awake in bed,
The voice of God came to me and said,
"While dealing with a stranger, common courtesy you use,
But the children you love, you seem to abuse.
Look on the kitchen floor,
You'll find some flowers there by the door,
Those are the flowers she brought for you.
She picked them herself, pink, yellow, and blue.
She stood quietly not to spoil the surprise,
And you never saw the tears in her eyes."
By this time I felt very small,
And now my tears began to fall.
I quietly went and knelt by her bed;
"Wake up little girl, wake up," I said.
"Are these the flowers you picked for me?​
 knew you'd like them, especially the blue."
I said, "Daughter, I am sorry for the way I did today,
I shouldn't have shout at you that way."
She said, "Oh Mommy that's okay
And I do like the flowers, especially the blue."​
Answer the following questions based on the poem.
1. Why did the mother yell at her daughter?
2. Mother has a different attitude toward her family and the stranger whom she
met. Why do you think she was different in treating people?
3. Have you experienced the same situation as the daughter in the poem? How did you react?
4. How would you explain these lines from the poem: "While dealing with a
stranger, common courtesy you use, but the children you love, you seem to @bus€d?
5. How would you define family, based on your understanding of the poem</h2><br />

"We must do something about father," said the son. "I've had enough of his spilledmilk, noisy eating, and food on the floor." So the husband and wife set a small table in the corner. There,Grandfather ate alone while the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. Since Grandfather had broken a dish or two, hisfood was served in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced in Grandfather's direction, sometime he had a tear inhis eye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple had for him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a forkor spilled food.The four-year-old watched it all in silence.One evening before supper, the father noticed his son playing with wood scraps on the floor. He asked thechild sweetly, "What are you making?” Just as sweetly, the boy responded, “Oh, I am making a little bowl for youand Mama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.The words so struck the parents so that they were speechless. Then tears started to stream down theircheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew what must be done.That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand and gently led him back to the family table. For theremainder of his days he ate every meal with the family. And for some reason, neither husband nor wife seemed tocare any longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or the tablecloth soiled.Questions:1.What is the setting of the story?2.Who are the characters?3.What is the conflict?How it was resolved in the story?4.What is the theme?How it is applicable in our present situation?​</h2><br />

                            29. The short story "The Lottery" by Shirley Jackson takes place a few hundred years ago on June 27 in a small town. The townspeople start the day as they normally would, but then at 10:00 all the residents had to report to the town square. Mr. Summers led the process. He brought with him a box with small pieces of paper inside of it. His first order of business was to take role and make sure he knew who was the head of each family and which members could not attend.  Mrs. Hutchinson arrived after he had been sworn in, declaring that she had forgotten what day it was to the amusement of those people who heard her. If the head male of the family were deceased or incapable of coming as in Clyde Dunbar's case due to a broken leg, then a son over the age of sixteen could stand in or the wife would have to pick for the family. As Mr. Summers called each family name, the representative would come forward and pick a piece of paper from the box without looking at it. While this process went on, some of the townspeople talked about how the north village was talking about giving up the lottery process. The older people in the crowd seemed to think that was ridiculous, saying "lottery in June, corn be heavy soon," but the younger members thought the idea had merit.  When Old Man Warner drew his slip, he declared it was his seventy-seventh time participating in the lottery. The last few people took their slips before everyone opened them. The crowd looked around wondering which family had the piece of paper with the black spot on it. It was Bill Hutchinson. Mrs. Dunbar told her oldest son to run and tell the news to his dad back at home.  Tessie Hutchinson immediately becomes defensive, saying her husband didn't have enough time, and it wasn't fair, but those around her encouraged her to calm down, including her husband who told her to shut her mouth. Then Mr. Summers focused in on the members of the Hutchinson family, which included Tessie and Bill along with their three children: Bill, Jr., Nancy, and Dave.  Since Dave was onl</h2><br />
