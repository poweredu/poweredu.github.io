#thank you for answering^_^</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>By the late 18th century, political and economic changes in Europe were finally beginning to affect Spain and, thus, the Philippines. Important as a stimulus to trade was the gradual elimination of the monopoly enjoyed by the galleon to Acapulco. The last galleon arrived in Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s Manila was open to foreign merchants almost without restriction. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The growth of commercial agriculture resulted in the appearance of a new class. Alongside the landholdings of the church and the rice estates of the pre-Spanish nobility there arose haciendas of coffee, hemp, and sugar, often the property of enterprising Chinese-Filipino mestizos. Some of the families that gained prominence in the 19th century have continued to play an important role in Philippine economics and politics.</p><p></p><p>Not until 1863 was there public education in the Philippines, and even then the church controlled the curriculum. Less than one-fifth of those who went to school could read and write Spanish, and far fewer could speak it properly. The limited higher education in the colony was entirely under clerical direction, but by the 1880s many sons of the wealthy were sent to Europe to study. There, nationalism and a passion for reform blossomed in the liberal atmosphere. Out of this talented group of overseas Filipino students arose what came to be known as the Propaganda Movement. Magazines, poetry, and pamphleteering flourished. José Rizal, this movement’s most brilliant figure, produced two political novels—Noli me tangere (1887; Touch Me Not) and El filibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed)—which had a wide impact in the Philippines. In 1892 Rizal returned home and formed the Liga Filipina, a modest reform-minded society, loyal to Spain, that breathed no word of independence. But Rizal was quickly arrested by the overly fearful Spanish, exiled to a remote island in the south, and finally executed in 1896. Meanwhile, within the Philippines there had developed a firm commitment to independence among a somewhat less privileged class.</p><br />

                        <p>History can be interpreted in a variety of ways, but one's interpretation of the past is based on personal experiences, and certain facts are universally accepted by <strong>historians</strong>.</p><p></p><strong>True</strong> 1. Historical interpretation is based on the judgment of historians judgment on how the past should be seen.<p></p><p>History as a discipline is heavily reliant on subjective knowledge, but that does not mean historians ignore objective knowledge.

We make sense of the past through historical interpretation.<p></p><p>Historical interpretations are based on historical knowledge; thus, a sense of the past can be maintained through one's understanding. It is largely dependent on the reader's perception of these events, and thus historical interpretations make sense of the past to some extent.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the answer given as true is correct.</p><p></p><strong>True</strong> 3. Multiperspectivity is a quality of historical writing attributed to a variety of lenses that may be used to view the past.<p></p><p>Several historians present their perspectives on historical events; for example, different historians interpret Aurangzeb's role in India differently.

The significance of the martyrdom of the GOMBURZA is questioned by historians.<p></p><p>Historians question the significance of the GOMBURZA martyrdom.

The Cavity Mutiny is an event that led to the execution of the GOMBURZA.<p></p><p>The mutiny began on January 20, 1872, when the laborers received their pay and discovered that the taxes and falla, the fine paid to be exempt from forced labor, had been deducted from their wages.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the answer given as true is correct.</p><p></p><strong>True</strong> 7. Jose Rizal’s essays go against the Catholic Faith.<p></p><p>Rizal, without a doubt, retracted his writings in order to marry Josephine Bracken. Jose Rizal's essays are diametrically opposed to the Catholic faith.

There is no doubt that Rizal retracted his writings to be able to marry Josephine Bracken.<p></p><p>Rizal did not retract because he remained defiant to the oppression that crippled Filipinos' lives and as proof of his conviction that he died loving his country.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the answer given as false is correct.</p><p></p><strong>True</strong> 9.
