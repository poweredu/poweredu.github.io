The phoenetics and meter of the lyric should aid the decision on the rhythm…yet the rhythm can equally give emphasis to each syllable of the lyric.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Lyric” comes from the Latin word “lyricus," meaning “of/for the lyre.” These short poems were originally accompanied by music. So in lyric poetry, the mood is melodic and emotional. The writer uses words that express his or her state of mind, perceptions, and feelings, rather than tell a story. A lyric poem is usually written in the first person. Some of the best examples of lyric poetry come from Italian and English sonnets. Let’s take a closer look.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer: SONG : IMAGINE</p><p></p><p>ANALYSIS Explanation:John Lennon was asking us to imagine a place where things that divide people (religion, possessions, etc) did not exist. He felt that it would be a much better place. This song is a strong political message that is sugarcoated in a beautiful melody. He realized that the softer approach would bring the song to a wider audience, who hopefully would listen to his message. In short, the messages of this song are that we should keep on optimistic to the peace and create the world as a better place to live. </p><p></p><p>Sana nakatulong^ ^Pa Like po</p><p></p><br />
