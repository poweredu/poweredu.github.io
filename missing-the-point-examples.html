                                            true or false 
1.To convert the rate to percent, the easiest way is to move the decimal point 2 places to the left.
2.To solve for the unknown value of rate (R), divide the percentage over rate, then multiply by 100%.
3.If the rate and percentage is given, then the base is missing, to solve for base, simply divide percentage over base.
4.In getting the value of percentage, simply multiply the rate and base for example, 5% × 18.
5.
To solve the percentage, multiply the rate and base, you need to convert first the rate to decimal notation.</a>

1.To convert the rate to percent, the easiest way is to move the decimal point 2 places to the left.
2.To solve for the unknown value of rate (R), divide the percentage over rate, then multiply by 100%.
3.If the rate and percentage is given, then the base is missing, to solve for base, simply divide percentage over base.
4.In getting the value of percentage, simply multiply the rate and base for example, 5% × 18.
5.
To solve the percentage, multiply the rate and base, you need to convert first the rate to decimal notation.</h2><br />
