Having the desire from a sublime mind rather than by an ill intention will lead a higher possibility of victory. Thus, whatever it is that you desire with your sublime and pure mind for the cooperate management to be, it will certainly prevail and succeed. There are self-centered people who only care about themselves. Even those greedy and egoistic individuals can achieve their goal. An ardent desire becomes reality whether the intensions are upright or selfish. However, if the desire arises from greed and self-interest, the same desire which brought success initially will cause to fall through in the end.​</a>

Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</a>

Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</a>

ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project will provide food for 55.000 low-income families, informal settlers, and families who have lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An initial 55,000 poor households affected by COVID-19 will receive a bag of rice, and canned goods from ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project. ADB has launched an emergency food provision program on 31 March, following the approval of the $5 million Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision technical assistance program. The grant is implemented under the Tagalog name Bayan Bayanihan, the well-known Filipino principle of sharing what one has with one's community.The program provides for essential food supplies to around 55,000 of the most vulnerable households in the National Capital Region and neighboring areas, affected by income losses for daily wage earners due to the enhanced quarantine to contain COVID-19. It will act as a 'bridge' support until ADB's large-scale cash transfer program is rolled out. The program has a collaboration platform to attract private sector and philanthropic contributions for its expansion.1. What is the newsflash about?2.

These brain alterations can last a long time, which is why <strong>drug </strong>addiction is referred to as a "relapsing" disease: people in recovery from <strong>drug </strong>use disorders are more likely to relapse after years of abstinence.</p><p>It's typical for people to relapse, but it doesn't indicate treatment isn't effective.

                            16. pa Tagalog po In every strong desire accompanied by hard work, there is triumph. Having the desire from a sublime mind rather than by an ill intention will lead a higher possibility of victory. Thus, whatever it is that you desire with your sublime and pure mind for the cooperate management to be, it will certainly prevail and succeed. There are self-centered people who only care about themselves. Even those greedy and egoistic individuals can achieve their goal. An ardent desire becomes reality whether the intensions are upright or selfish. However, if the desire arises from greed and self-interest, the same desire which brought success initially will cause to fall through in the end.​</h2><br />

Projects approved under Duterte breach P3 trillion, buoy recovery hope
The New Clark City, which spans 9,450 hectares, is being hailed as the country's first smart, green, and resilient metropolis. It is one of the Bases Conversion and Development Authority's major initiatives. Israeli companies specializing in providing green technologies and digital applications are among the most recent visitors to New Clark City.
PROJECTS approved by the Duterte administration exceeded P3 trillion as of February 2021, according to data released by the National Economic and Development Authority (Neda). Based on Neda Board approvals as of February 2021, approvals reached P3.8 trillion covering 91 infrastructure projects.
At the start of the Duterte administration, the government had aimed to spend P7 trillion to P8 trillion worth of projects to usher in the “golden age of infrastructure.” The top 10 projects approved by the Neda Board had a collective price tag of P2.78 trillion or 72.45 percent of the total approved by the Duterte administration in over four years of the President’s term.
The Unsolicited Proposal for the Bulacan International Airport Scheme, valued at P735.634 billion, is the administration's biggest project. The Department of Transportation will carry that out in a Public-Private Partnership (PPP) (DOTr).
The Bulacan International Airport in Bulakan, Bulacan, is being built, operated, and maintained, and includes airport expansion (including a passenger terminal facility, airside and landside facilities), as well as an 8.4-kilometer tollway connecting to the North Luzon Expressway in Marilao, Bulacan.
The project’s new cost of P628.421 billion and change in scope was approved by the Neda Board; it will be funded by Official Development Assistance (ODA) and undertaken by the DOTr. Another big-ticket approval was the Metro Manila Subway Project (MMSP)-Phase 1, to cost P356.974 billion, to be financed through ODA and also undertaken by the DOTr. The project is a 25.3-km subway, to run from Mindanao Avenue in Quezon City to FTI in Taguig then to Naia. Its components include civil works; electromechanical, signaling, and telecommunications systems; station facilities; depot facilities; land acquisition; and procurement of rolling stock.</h2><br />

Main organ
Kalayaan (dated January 1896, published March 1896)[3][4]
Documents discovered in the 21st century suggest that the society had been organized as early as January 1892 but may not have become active until July 7 of the same year; that was the date that Filipino writer José Rizal was to be banished to Dapitan.
Founded by Filipino patriots Andrés Bonifacio, Teodoro Plata, Ladislao Diwa and others, the Katipunan was a secret organization until it was discovered in 1896. This discovery led to the outbreak of the Philippine Revolution.
The Katipunan being a secret organization, its members were subjected to the utmost secrecy and were expected to abide by the rules established by the society.[6] Aspiring applicants were given standard initiation rites in order to become members of the society. At first, membership in the Katipunan was only open to male Filipinos; later, women were accepted into the society. The Katipunan had its own publication, Kalayaan (Freedom) which issued its first and last printing in March 1896. Revolutionary ideals and works flourished within the society, and Filipino literature was expanded by some of its prominent members.
In planning the revolution, Bonifacio contacted Rizal for his full-fledged support for the Katipunan in exchange for a promise to rescue Rizal from his detention. In May 1896, the leadership of the Katipunan met with the Captain of a visiting Japanese warship in an attempt to secure a source of arms for the revolution, but without success.[7] The Katipunan's existence was revealed to the Spanish authorities. Days after the Spanish authorities learned of the existence of the secret society, in August 1896, Bonifacio and his men tore up their cédulas during the Cry of Balintawak that started the Philippine Revolution of 1896.</h2><br />

ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project will provide food for 55.000 low-income families, informal settlers, and families who have lost their livelihoods due to the COVID-19 pandemic. An initial 55,000 poor households affected by COVID-19 will receive a bag of rice, and canned goods from ADB's Bayan Bayanihan project. ADB has launched an emergency food provision program on 31 March, following the approval of the $5 million Rapid Emergency Supplies Provision technical assistance program. The grant is implemented under the Tagalog name Bayan Bayanihan, the well-known Filipino principle of sharing what one has with one's community.The program provides for essential food supplies to around 55,000 of the most vulnerable households in the National Capital Region and neighboring areas, affected by income losses for daily wage earners due to the enhanced quarantine to contain COVID-19. It will act as a 'bridge' support until ADB's large-scale cash transfer program is rolled out. The program has a collaboration platform to attract private sector and philanthropic contributions for its expansion.1. What is the newsflash about?2.
