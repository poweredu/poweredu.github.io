Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?."

                                            Story:Death of a Salesman (Summary) A stage play written by Arthur Miller Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a business trip he has cancelled. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss Howard Wagner to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son, Biff, has yet to do something with his life. Despite Biff's potential as a football star in high school, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university. Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff's unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father's mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys' high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make a business proposition the next day. The next day, Willy goes to ask Howard for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail; Willy gets angry and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him he needs a rest and can no longer represent the company, while Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. Biff impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard, now a successful lawyer. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is "worth more dead than alive." Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear bad news from Biff. Happy tries to get Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Willy had been in Boston for work, and Biff went to visit him to ask Willy to convince his teacher to curve Biff's failing math grade. Willy was in the middle of an affair with a receptionist, when Biff arrived unexpectedly at the hotel room, and saw the woman, who was half-dressed. Willy attempted to explain away her presence as an innocent borrowing of his shower, while her own room was undergoing renovations, but Biff is unconvinced and angrily dismisses Willie as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set him adrift. Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy picked up, leaving a confused and upset Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead brother Ben. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out. The final scene takes place at Willy's funeral, which is attended only by his family, Charley and Bernard. The ambiguities of mixed and unaddressed emotions persist, particularly over whether Willy's choices or circumstances were obsolete. At the funeral, Biff retains his belief that he does not want to become a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, while Linda laments her husband's decision just before her final payment on the house. QUESTION:1. How would you describe Willy as a father?2. What can you tell about the relationship of the family to each other?3. What led Willy to commit suicide? Is there a way that this could have been avoided? ​</a>

A Glass Of Milk 
A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?." 
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." 
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness. 
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. He recognized her at once. 
He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

Clarkson went a short way with us but tumed back The wind was furious, and we thought we mort have returned We first rested in the large boathouse, then under a furze bush opposite Mr Clarkson saw the plough goingin the field The wind seized our breath The lake was rough There was a beat by itself floating in the middle of the bay below Water Millock We rested again in the Water Millock Lane The hawthorns are black and green, the birches here and there greenish, but there is yet more of purple to be seen on the twigs We got overinto a field to avoid some cowe people working. A few primroses by the roadside-wood sorrel flower, the anemone, scentless violets, strawberries, and that starty yellow flower which Mrs C. calls pile worth When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park we saw a few daffodils close to the waterside. We fancied that the sea had floated the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went along there were more and yet more, and at last, under the boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a longbelt of them along the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpik road. I neversaw daffodils so beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones about and above them; some rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow, for weariness, and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake; they looked so gay, ever glancing, ever changing This wind blew directly over the lake to them There was here and there a little knot, and a few stragglers higher up, but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity, unity, and life of that one busy highway We rested again and again. The bays were stormy, and we heard the wavesat different distances, and in the middle of the water, like the sea.. All was cheerless and gloomy, so we faced the storm. At Dobson's I was very kindly treated by a young woman. The landlady looked sour, but it her way... William was sitting by a good fire when I came downstairs. He soon made his way to the libre piled up in a corner of the window.

• Where and when did the story happen?
• Why was Zuleika sorrowful?
• Why was Zuleika’s gift the most precious?
Far out in the desert of Arabia lived a chief called Ali Ben Ahmed and
his tribe. Their tents were pitched on the trackless sand where the
blazing sun beat down all day. Month after month, they saw no stranger
for the paths of the travelers lay far to the south.
One evening, however, little Zuleika, the chief’s daughter, ran to her
father for she have seen someone riding their way from the south.
Ali Ben Ahmed came out of his tent and stood beside his beautiful little
daughter. The chief scanned the southern horizon until his eyes found
a little yellow cloud of dust in the far distance.
Zuleika danced with delight. She loved visitors who told stories of the
wonders which her eyes had never seen. They had talked of cities with
great stone houses, of lovely green gardens, of sparkling rivers, and
cool blue seas. To the little girl who had lived all her life in the desert,
these stories were marvelous fairy tales. Ali Ben Ahmed called his men
to welcome the newcomer for the desert Arabs are very hospitable.
They bowed their turbaned heads almost to the ground to a low salaam
as the rider pulled up his sweating mount. The stranger, who was proud
and dignified, returned the salute and said that the great sheik Ben
Nedi will visit their tribe the next day.
The whole camp bustled with excitement, Ben Nedi was a very great sheik indeed, known far and wife
for his power and goodness, and to have him visit the remote tents of Ali Ben Ahmed was an honor.
Every Arab in the camp busied himself in preparing a gift for the coming sheik for ity is an Arabian
custom to gicve gifts of welcome and hospitality.
Only little Zuleika sat alone and idle. Tears stood in her lovely dark eyes
because she had no gift to give the great man who would come the next day.
Her mother, busy in the women’s tent unrolling a beautiful peace of silk that would be her gift the next
day, tried to comfort the child and told her that children are not expected to give gifts.
But Zuleika was not comforted. She slipped away from the tents and sat on a great stone near the well
and wept.
Suddenly, out of the well appeared a misty white figure which took the shape of a beautiful veiled
woman. Her smile was sweet and when she spoke; her voice was like the soft ripple of running
water. Zuleika, looking at her in amazement, knew that she could be no other than the good fairy of
the well.
The fairy asked Zuleika to stop crying because she shall have a gift to give to the sheik and Zuleika
will find it the next day where her tears have fallen upon the sand.
Then the shining figure faded away, melting into the misty light like a pale moonbeam. Zuleika ran
back to her tent, but she could sleep little that night. As soon as dawn broke, she hurried out into the
sand to find the gift which she was to give that day.
She came to the well and stopped in amazement. Where yesterday there had been nothing but bare
sand, today there was a tall tree. It was straight and bare except the top, where it carried a tuft of
branching leaves and a cluster of brownish fruit.
Zuleika rushed back to her father’s tent and told him everything that had happened.
Her father would not believe that there was a tree in the desert until he had seen the tree for himself
and tasted its fruits.
In the afternoon, the caravan of the great sheik Ben Nedi arrived. Gifts were brought and laid before
him – gifts of jewels, of gold, of silk and of beautiful steel swords from Damascus. The great man
received them with gratitude and praise.
Ali Ben Ahmed smiled then led Ben Nedi to the rock by the well where the date palm grew from the
spot on which Zuleika’s tears had fallen upon the ground and explained how the wonder tree had
sprung up miraculously in the night.
Upon knowing everything, Ben Nedi softly exclaimed, “Yes, that is the most precious gift of all, for it
springs from the desire of the heart.”
And sure enough, the date palm spread until it became the great friend of the desert tribes. As long
as it lifts its stately head above the ands, the Arabian knows that it will furnish him with food from
its fruit, cloth form its fiber and cool shade from its leafy palms.</a>

Finally, one day wlule I was enting a sandwich in a downtown coffee shop. my luck began to change. A young woman who was sitting next to me asks if she could read my newspaper. I say okay, and we start talking She begins to tell me that she is an executive in a huge advertising company and is looking for an assistant.

                                            The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</a>

A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?."
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart."
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness.
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room.
He recognized her at once. He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all.
Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

                            20. Story:Death of a Salesman (Summary) A stage play written by Arthur Miller Willy Loman returns home exhausted after a business trip he has cancelled. Worried over Willy's state of mind and recent car accident, his wife Linda suggests that he ask his boss Howard Wagner to allow him to work in his home city so he will not have to travel. Willy complains to Linda that their son, Biff, has yet to do something with his life. Despite Biff's potential as a football star in high school, he failed in mathematics and was therefore unable to enter a university. Biff and his younger brother, Happy, who is temporarily staying with Willy and Linda after Biff's unexpected return from the West, reminisce about their childhood together. They discuss their father's mental degeneration, which they have witnessed in the form of his constant indecisiveness and daydreaming about the boys' high school years. Eventually, Willy walks in, angry that the two boys have never amounted to anything. In an effort to pacify their father, Biff and Happy tell him that Biff plans to make a business proposition the next day. The next day, Willy goes to ask Howard for a job in town while Biff goes to make a business proposition, but they both fail; Willy gets angry and ends up getting fired when Howard tells him he needs a rest and can no longer represent the company, while Biff waits hours to see a former employer who does not remember him and turns him down. Biff impulsively steals a fountain pen. Willy then goes to the office of his neighbor Charley, where he runs into Charley's son Bernard, now a successful lawyer. Bernard tells him that Biff originally wanted to go to summer school to make up for failing math, but something happened in Boston when Biff went to visit his father that changed his mind. Charley gives the now-unemployed Willy money to pay his life-insurance premium, and Willy shocks Charley by remarking that ultimately, a man is "worth more dead than alive." Happy, Biff, and Willy meet for dinner at a restaurant, but Willy refuses to hear bad news from Biff. Happy tries to get Biff to lie to their father. Biff tries to tell him what happened as Willy gets angry and slips into a flashback of what happened in Boston the day Biff came to see him: Willy had been in Boston for work, and Biff went to visit him to ask Willy to convince his teacher to curve Biff's failing math grade. Willy was in the middle of an affair with a receptionist, when Biff arrived unexpectedly at the hotel room, and saw the woman, who was half-dressed. Willy attempted to explain away her presence as an innocent borrowing of his shower, while her own room was undergoing renovations, but Biff is unconvinced and angrily dismisses Willie as a liar and a fake before storming out. From that moment, Biff's views of his father changed and set him adrift. Biff leaves the restaurant in frustration, followed by Happy and two girls that Happy picked up, leaving a confused and upset Willy behind. When they later return home, Linda angrily confronts them for abandoning their father while Willy remains outside, talking to himself. Biff tries to reconcile with Willy, but the discussion quickly escalates into another argument. Biff conveys plainly to his father that he is not meant for anything great, insisting that both of them are simply ordinary men meant to lead ordinary lives. The argument reaches an apparent climax as Biff hugs Willy and begins to cry as he tries to get Willy to let go of his unrealistic expectations. Rather than listen to what Biff actually says, Willy appears to believe his son has forgiven him and will follow in his footsteps, and after Linda goes upstairs to bed, lapses one final time into a hallucination, thinking he is talking to his long-dead brother Ben. In Willy's mind, Ben approves of the scheme Willy has dreamed up to kill himself in order to give Biff his insurance policy money. Willy exits the house, and Biff and Linda cry out in despair as the sound of Willy's car blares up and fades out. The final scene takes place at Willy's funeral, which is attended only by his family, Charley and Bernard. The ambiguities of mixed and unaddressed emotions persist, particularly over whether Willy's choices or circumstances were obsolete. At the funeral, Biff retains his belief that he does not want to become a businessman like his father. Happy, on the other hand, chooses to follow in his father's footsteps, while Linda laments her husband's decision just before her final payment on the house. QUESTION:1.

A poor young boy who was begging from door to door to feed his hungry stomach decided he would ask for a meal at the next house. However, he lost his nerve when a lovely young woman opened the door. Instead of a meal, he just asked for a glass of water; the woman thought he looked hungry, so she brought him a large glass of milk. He drank it slowly and then asked, "how much do I owe you?." 
"You don't owe me anything, she replied. Mother has taught us never to accept payment for a kindness." He said, "Then I thank you from my heart." 
Years later, that young woman became critically ill, the local doctors were battling because they couldn't cure her, and they finally sent her to the big city, where they called specialists to study her rare illness. 
Dr. Howard Kelly was called in for the consultation; when he heard the town's name where she came from, a strange light filled his eyes. Immediately, he rose and went down the hall of the hospital to her room. He recognized her at once. 
He went back to the consultation room, determined to do his best to save her life. From that day, he gave special attention to that case. After a long struggle, the battle was won! Dr. Kelly requested the business office to pass the final bill to him for approval. He looked at it, then wrote something on the bill. It was sent to her room; the woman feared opening it, for she was sure it might take the rest of her life to pay for it all. Finally, she looked and noticed something was written at the edge of the note, 'paid in full with a glass of milk.' Tears filled her eyes as she immediately remembered.

Clarkson went a short way with us but tumed back The wind was furious, and we thought we mort have returned We first rested in the large boathouse, then under a furze bush opposite Mr Clarkson saw the plough goingin the field The wind seized our breath The lake was rough There was a beat by itself floating in the middle of the bay below Water Millock We rested again in the Water Millock Lane The hawthorns are black and green, the birches here and there greenish, but there is yet more of purple to be seen on the twigs We got overinto a field to avoid some cowe people working. A few primroses by the roadside-wood sorrel flower, the anemone, scentless violets, strawberries, and that starty yellow flower which Mrs C. calls pile worth When we were in the woods beyond Gowbarrow Park we saw a few daffodils close to the waterside. We fancied that the sea had floated the seeds ashore, and that the little colony had so sprung up. But as we went along there were more and yet more, and at last, under the boughs of the trees, we saw that there was a longbelt of them along the shore, about the breadth of a country turnpik road. I neversaw daffodils so beautiful. They grew among the mossy stones about and above them; some rested their heads upon these stones, as on a pillow, for weariness, and the rest tossed and reeled and danced, and seemed as if they verily laughed with the wind that blew upon them over the lake; they looked so gay, ever glancing, ever changing This wind blew directly over the lake to them There was here and there a little knot, and a few stragglers higher up, but they were so few as not to disturb the simplicity, unity, and life of that one busy highway We rested again and again. The bays were stormy, and we heard the wavesat different distances, and in the middle of the water, like the sea.. All was cheerless and gloomy, so we faced the storm. At Dobson's I was very kindly treated by a young woman. The landlady looked sour, but it her way... William was sitting by a good fire when I came downstairs.

• Where and when did the story happen?
• Why was Zuleika sorrowful?
• Why was Zuleika’s gift the most precious?
Far out in the desert of Arabia lived a chief called Ali Ben Ahmed and
his tribe. Their tents were pitched on the trackless sand where the
blazing sun beat down all day. Month after month, they saw no stranger
for the paths of the travelers lay far to the south.
One evening, however, little Zuleika, the chief’s daughter, ran to her
father for she have seen someone riding their way from the south.
Ali Ben Ahmed came out of his tent and stood beside his beautiful little
daughter. The chief scanned the southern horizon until his eyes found
a little yellow cloud of dust in the far distance.
Zuleika danced with delight. She loved visitors who told stories of the
wonders which her eyes had never seen. They had talked of cities with
great stone houses, of lovely green gardens, of sparkling rivers, and
cool blue seas. To the little girl who had lived all her life in the desert,
these stories were marvelous fairy tales. Ali Ben Ahmed called his men
to welcome the newcomer for the desert Arabs are very hospitable.
They bowed their turbaned heads almost to the ground to a low salaam
as the rider pulled up his sweating mount. The stranger, who was proud
and dignified, returned the salute and said that the great sheik Ben
Nedi will visit their tribe the next day.
The whole camp bustled with excitement, Ben Nedi was a very great sheik indeed, known far and wife
for his power and goodness, and to have him visit the remote tents of Ali Ben Ahmed was an honor.
Every Arab in the camp busied himself in preparing a gift for the coming sheik for ity is an Arabian
custom to gicve gifts of welcome and hospitality.
Only little Zuleika sat alone and idle. Tears stood in her lovely dark eyes
because she had no gift to give the great man who would come the next day.
Her mother, busy in the women’s tent unrolling a beautiful peace of silk that would be her gift the next
day, tried to comfort the child and told her that children are not expected to give gifts.
But Zuleika was not comforted. She slipped away from the tents and sat on a great stone near the well
and wept.
Suddenly, out of the well appeared a misty white figure which took the shape of a beautiful veiled
woman. Her smile was sweet and when she spoke; her voice was like the soft ripple of running
water. Zuleika, looking at her in amazement, knew that she could be no other than the good fairy of
the well.
The fairy asked Zuleika to stop crying because she shall have a gift to give to the sheik and Zuleika
will find it the next day where her tears have fallen upon the sand.
Then the shining figure faded away, melting into the misty light like a pale moonbeam. Zuleika ran
back to her tent, but she could sleep little that night. As soon as dawn broke, she hurried out into the
sand to find the gift which she was to give that day.
She came to the well and stopped in amazement. Where yesterday there had been nothing but bare
sand, today there was a tall tree. It was straight and bare except the top, where it carried a tuft of
branching leaves and a cluster of brownish fruit.
Zuleika rushed back to her father’s tent and told him everything that had happened.
Her father would not believe that there was a tree in the desert until he had seen the tree for himself
and tasted its fruits.
In the afternoon, the caravan of the great sheik Ben Nedi arrived. Gifts were brought and laid before
him – gifts of jewels, of gold, of silk and of beautiful steel swords from Damascus. The great man
received them with gratitude and praise.
Ali Ben Ahmed smiled then led Ben Nedi to the rock by the well where the date palm grew from the
spot on which Zuleika’s tears had fallen upon the ground and explained how the wonder tree had
sprung up miraculously in the night.
Upon knowing everything, Ben Nedi softly exclaimed, “Yes, that is the most precious gift of all, for it
springs from the desire of the heart.”
And sure enough, the date palm spread until it became the great friend of the desert tribes. As long
as it lifts its stately head above the ands, the Arabian knows that it will furnish him with food from
its fruit, cloth form its fiber and cool shade from its leafy palms.</h2><br />

                            30. The Golden Fish Acts WiselyUpon a certain island in the middle of the sea lived a fisherman and his wife. Theywere so poor they often went without bread when the fishing did not go well.One day the man caught a small golden fish who begged to be let go. Because theman did let him go, the little fish promised that he would come back if the fisherman everneeded help. The man said that he and his wife had no food, and when the man returnedhome there was a nice meal on the table. But the fisherman's wife was greedy.After she ate the nice meal, she went to bed planning what they should demand fromthe golden fish next. She woke up early the next morning and shook her husband awake.“Wake up, you lazy man! Go and tell your fish that I need a new washtub!” So he went andcalled to the golden fish again, and when he returned home there was a beautiful newwashtub in the yard.Each day the fisherman's wife had a new demand. And each one was granted. Thefisherman's wife got a big new house, beautiful new clothes, servants to do her work, and ahorse-drawn carriage to ride in. But the fisherman did not enjoy the new things, and he wasashamed of his greedy wife. She was rude to the servants, and she was too busy thinking upnew demands to speak to her husband.Once again, she demanded that he call the golden fish. She wanted to be Queen ofthe Waters. “Make your wife Queen of the Waters?” exclaimed the golden fish. That is thelast thing I should do. She is unfit to rule. She cannot even rule herself. I shall make her apoor woman again. Goodbye! You will see me no more.”With great sorrow and dread, the fisherman went home to tell his wife the news. Tohis surprise, the big house had been transformed into their little old cabin, and his wife wasclothed in rags. Life was much easier for the fisherman after that. His wife had learned theresults of greed. She planted a little garden, to provide food when the fishing did not go well.Sometimes when the fisherman drew in his line, the sun glinted on the scales of hiscatch, and he had a moment's hope of seeing his little friend again. But that was never tocome to pass.                 "Story Map"Setting:characters: Plot Beginning:Middle:Ending:Theme:So sorry if this was long Nonsense = Report ​</h2><br />
