                                            In this lesson, you will be taught to differentiate the language used in different disciplines such as Business, Law, Art, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, Science, Sports and TechVoc. Learning about the language as used in context will improve your understanding and widen your knowledge on the varied academic texts from various disciplines.Language plays a vital role in our daily conversation. This language may be used in communicating with other people either spoken or written. Taking into accounts, academic language takes place in our professional dealings. This language varies especially when used in various  disciplines. For instance, the word 'division' may be used differently in parliament, mathematics and sports. Read and analyze  the short text below to learn about this matter.Which _process_ is stronger and more important? Which process we shall encourage and which discourage? A competition which makes sure that humans are still going forward or cooperation which assures that we are still human beings and can solve common problems together. A dilemma that has always existed, a natural choice  that human  beings has been confronted. Fortunately it was the greatest skill of humans to combine these two paradoxically contradictory  processes to produce the world we are living now and to keep  improving it. -Competition_ can be defined as a process where one being  rivals the other in reaching certain objective faster and smarter. It is a _force_ that has been given by nature and has assured that only those who deserve to survive will be able to do it. Long before the human beings have appeared on earth other creatures were  competing with each other for a single aim of survival. Advent of humans didn't change the basic import of competition. They started to complete  not only with  other animals environing them but also  with animals of the same kind, namely, humans. Competing with environment allowed humans to take control of it and produced improvements, innovation and modernizations that humans have enjoyed throughout their _evolution_. However, competition and cooperation are merely one side of the same coin. When competition is a rival between two or more to reach an aim, cooperation is an agreement to reach that aim together. Competition makes sure that only strongest survive regardless of the purpose, cooperation insures that the survival is adhered to the purpose. An _organization_ of people to reach a common aim can be narrowly called as a society, and society was enabled only by cooperation. _Cooperation_ is a force that assured a leading role of humans on this planet, a continuation of a progress of human beings.Guide Question:1.

Guide QuestionsWhat do you notice with the flow of lines being formed?Which melody has a wider movement of music notes and which one has a closer note movement?On a wider scale, National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA’s) Felipe M. De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature. TRANSFERAfter listening to the audio sample provided, try to answer the following questions. 1. What do you notice about the melody? What instrument played it? 2. How about the mood of the pieces? How can you say that it shows a happy mood, a sad mood, a relax mood, a playful mood, a patriotic mood? 3. Suppose all the instruments will only play the melody of the piece, what do you think will be your general impression about the piece? 4. How does the dynamics of the piece affect its overall sound? Which is better, a piece with dynamics or without dynamics? Why? 5. If ever you will choose your rondalla instrument, what will it be? Why? 6. After listening each given folksong, how would you differentiate the characteristics of the Tagalog, Ilocano, and Bicolano folksongs?makikisagot po ng maayos and yung link ng vid po is nasa pic hehe thank youuuu​</a>

                                            The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on. Question :How are you going to differentiate arts from nature. 2.State your reason why art is man-made. 3.How is art related to humanities? ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer</strong><strong> </strong><strong>:</strong><strong> </strong>Art is basically creation by human beings though there are natural creations that are no less than best pieces of visual art. Art has been defined as “the use of skill and imagination in the creation of aesthetic objects, environments, or experiences that can be shared with others” – (Britannica Online). If one goes by this definition, art has existed since time immemorial. It has been there in the form of wall paintings, frescos, body piercing, tattoos, statues, paintings etc. Art is the imagination in the mind of the artist that he transforms into a tangible form through his skills. An artist gets inspired mostly by nature though there are times when the genius of the artist draws on his own. For a long time now there has been a heated debate going on to find out differences between art and nature. Let us join this debate.</p><p></p><p>Art is basically creation by human beings though there are natural creations that are no less than best pieces of visual art.

The term organic is now ubiquitous and is being used as a marketing term to attract more and more customers. If this is what happens with food and clothing, one can easily assume the attraction for nature and things natural for someone who is artistic by nature. Nature has always been kind enough to inspire hordes of artists, and the impact of nature and natural objects has been more than evident on art works of artists down the civilization.</p><p></p><p></p><p>hope it helps༼ つ ◕‿◕ ༽つ</p><p></p><br />

                            6. In this lesson, you will be taught to differentiate the language used in different disciplines such as Business, Law, Art, Philosophy, Politics, Religion, Science, Sports and TechVoc. Learning about the language as used in context will improve your understanding and widen your knowledge on the varied academic texts from various disciplines.Language plays a vital role in our daily conversation. This language may be used in communicating with other people either spoken or written. Taking into accounts, academic language takes place in our professional dealings. This language varies especially when used in various  disciplines. For instance, the word 'division' may be used differently in parliament, mathematics and sports. Read and analyze  the short text below to learn about this matter.Which _process_ is stronger and more important? Which process we shall encourage and which discourage? A competition which makes sure that humans are still going forward or cooperation which assures that we are still human beings and can solve common problems together. A dilemma that has always existed, a natural choice  that human  beings has been confronted. Fortunately it was the greatest skill of humans to combine these two paradoxically contradictory  processes to produce the world we are living now and to keep  improving it. -Competition_ can be defined as a process where one being  rivals the other in reaching certain objective faster and smarter. It is a _force_ that has been given by nature and has assured that only those who deserve to survive will be able to do it. Long before the human beings have appeared on earth other creatures were  competing with each other for a single aim of survival. Advent of humans didn't change the basic import of competition. They started to complete  not only with  other animals environing them but also  with animals of the same kind, namely, humans. Competing with environment allowed humans to take control of it and produced improvements, innovation and modernizations that humans have enjoyed throughout their _evolution_. However, competition and cooperation are merely one side of the same coin. When competition is a rival between two or more to reach an aim, cooperation is an agreement to reach that aim together. Competition makes sure that only strongest survive regardless of the purpose, cooperation insures that the survival is adhered to the purpose. An _organization_ of people to reach a common aim can be narrowly called as a society, and society was enabled only by cooperation. _Cooperation_ is a force that assured a leading role of humans on this planet, a continuation of a progress of human beings.Guide Question:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>MALAYSIAN ARTS VERSUS INDONESIAN ARTS<p><strong>DIFFERENCES:</strong>
</p><p><strong>Malaysian Art</strong>
</p>Vibrant Color: uses hues of blue, purple, and red
Nature designs: flowers, birds, etc.  batik technique: batik, method of dyeing in which patterned areas are covered with wax so they will not receive the colour. The method is used mainly on cottons and in the traditional colours of blue, brown, and red.
<p>
</p><p><strong>Indonesian Art</strong>
</p>Earthly colors: earth tone or neutral colors such as browns, blues, and whites
Geometrical designs: circles, oblongs, squares
Imprinting using ambatik technique: The word 'ambatik' means to mark with spots or dots. In a wider sense, it signifies drawing, painting or writing. No such word is to be found in the old Javanese language, so we can conclude that batik is a word of fairly recent origin. Batik is an ancient art that has been carried forward for thousands of years.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>no.1 </p><p>Africa is home to some of the world's most endangered species, including the mountain gorilla, Grevy’s zebra, and Ethiopian wolf. To protect populations from further decline, our on-the-ground safeguards involve training rangers and using sniffer dogs to stop wildlife traffickers. Wildlife must survive in their natural habitats, so we empower local communities through conservation-friendly development and work with international agencies to protect Africa’s natural resources.</p><p></p><p>Critical to protecting these vital ecosystems are people. Sharing land across the continent, local communities and wildlife often live alongside each other, leading to struggles for space and water. If people and wildlife learn to live together — inside and outside of protected areas — the future for all will thrive.</p><br />

De Leon, in his article about the Diversity of Philippine Music Cultures mentioned some contrasting features of Ilocanos’ and the Visayans’ art forms. Ilocanos prefer the movement of their music to be closer (conjunct) while the Visayans like it farther (disjunct). Ilocano dances have inward hand and arms movement while the Visayans have outward gestures. These intriguing polar artistic characteristics of the two subcultures may have rooted from their own natural values, the Ilocanos’ reserve attitude and the Visayans’ being highly-spirited; the Ilocanos’ survival instinct and the Visayans’ jubilant nature.

                            15. The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on.
