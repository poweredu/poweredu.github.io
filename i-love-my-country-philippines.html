Naranjo  The Philippines is one of the most visited countries in the world. There are numerous good reasons why many tourists visit the Philippines.  Firstly, I believe that the Philippines is known for its hospitable people. Filipinos are very welcoming and accommodating. I am certain that these Filipino characteristics are very attractive to many foreigners.  In my experience, Filipinos are always ready to help other people in need. They are generous. They always share with others, even if sometimes they only have little. It is their belief that sharing is loving.  Also, many tourists think that the Philippines has the most beautiful islands and beaches. It has Palawan, Bohol, Siargao, Leyte, and Boracay, to name a few. They take the view that Philippine islands and beaches are breathtaking, and there are a lot of sea adventures to experience and delicious local foods to partake and share. Also, the Philippines has a unique culture to learn and appreciate. I cannot deny that I agree with all these thoughts.  In conclusion, I am convinced that many foreigners love the Philippines. That is why, they continue to visit it and others even choose to stay in the country. ​</a>

Naranjo The Philippines is one of the most visited countries in the world There are many good reasons why any tourists visit the Philippines Firstly, I believe that the Philippines is known to have hospitable people Filipinos are very welcoming and accommodating. I am certain that these Filipino characteristics are very attractive to many foreigners In my experience Filipinos are always ready to help other people in need. They are generous They always share with others, even if sometimes they only have the it is their belief that sharing is loving Also, many tourists think that the Philippines has the most beautiful islands and beaches It has Palawan, Bohol, Siargao Leyte, and Boracay, to name a few. They take the view that Philippine islands and beaches are breath-taking and there are a lot of sea adventures to experience. They have delicious local foods.

MY OWN AND ONLY LAND
This is the Philippines,
This is my own and only land;

I dive for pearls in her deep oceans

I will fight and die to keep her forever free.
This is my country
God gave it to me.

I am certain that these Filipino characteristics are very attractive to many foreigners In my experience Filipinos are always ready to help other people in need. They are generous They always share with others, even if sometimes they only have the it is their belief that sharing is loving Also, many tourists think that the Philippines has the most beautiful islands and beaches It has Palawan, Bohol, Siargao Leyte, and Boracay, to name a few. They take the view that Philippine islands and beaches are breath-taking and there are a lot of sea adventures to experience. They have delicious local foods. Also, the Philippines has a unique culture I cannot deny that I agree with all these thoughts In conclusion, I am convinced that many foreigners love the Philippines. That is why, they continue to visit the country. Others even choose to stay 1.2.  3.4.5.6.7.8.​</h2><br />

DIRECTIONS: Read the poem then answer the following questions
below.
MY OWN AND ONLY LAND
This is the Philippines,
This is my own and only land;
I love her hills and plains,
I love her rivers and oceans,
I love her radiant sunsets and blue skies,
I raise food from her rich soils,
I dive for pearls in her deep oceans
I mine the gold underneath the mountains.
I will make my country clean and safe,
I will work and live for her,
I will fight and die to keep her forever free.
This is my country
God gave it to me.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Para sa akin, walang mali sa sinabi nya. Although hindi natin alam kung ito ba ay talagang nasa puso nya or pakitang tao lang. Hindi lamang ang presidente ang dapat kumikilos, sya ang nag gguide sa lahat sa kung paano patatakbuhin ang bansa. Bagama't marami parin ang hadlang sa kanyang mga aksyon at ipinatutupad, magbase tayo sa kung ano ang nararanasang komplikasyon at suliranin ng bansa. Isa na yung pandemya, hindi ito maiiwasan pero hindi patay ang paraan. Ang pangulo ay gumagawa ng solusyon at umaaksyon para sa ikaluluwag at ikakaahon ng bansa. He implemented ECQ para atleast mareduce yung number ng cases but still hindi parin pala yun ang makakatulong. Minsan yung misong tao nalang talaga ang problema. Walang pangulo na hindi layunin ang paunlarin ng bansa. Iba iba lang ang proseso nila hindi lang siguro natin nakikita. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Not sure kung tama sagot pero sana nakatulong.</p><br />

NaranjoThe Philippines is one of the most visited countries in the world. There arenumerous good reasons why many tourists visit the Philippines.Firstly, I believe that the Philippines is known for its hospitable people. Filipinosare very welcoming and accommodating. I am certain that these Filipino characteristicsare very attractive to many foreigners.In my experience, Filipinos are always ready to help other people in need. Theyare generous. They always share with others, even if sometimes they only have little. It istheir belief that sharing is loving.Also, many tourists think that the Philippines has the most beautiful islands andbeaches. It has Palawan, Bohol, Siargao, Leyte, and Boracay, to name a few. They takethe view that Philippine islands and beaches are breathtaking, and there are a lot of seaadventures to experience and delicious local foods to partake and share. Also, thePhilippines has a unique culture to learn and appreciate. I cannot deny that I agree withall these thoughts.In conclusion, I am convinced that many foreigners love the Philippines.
