FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable
Good moral values and respectful most of all
With long-patience and all lovable.
Filipinos help each other, whether rich or poor
For those who need especially the neighbor
Filipinos are brave and pride they stand for
To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.
Filipinos are always smiling
Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.
I am proud to be a Filipino, in blood and skin
The religion of Christianity in God we believed in
Our own mother tongue we use and for grandchildren
The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.

                                            Read the inspiring Filipino advocacies.Explain in three sentences how their advocacies help people.A.Diana Soto Dayal (Manila Street Love)What is your advocacy and it's significance ? My advocacy is to bring back love and joy to the streets- with focus on the homeless kids and senior citizens.Theres been a rubble of blood , hopelessness , darkness on our streets and with Manila street love,we try to introduce some light and love via our mobile outreach and campaigns.Why is it important to me? I drive around the streets almost every day and I don't really see much help is given.We forget they are people too and if we can make an impact at the moment why not? If we want to develop as a society ,we need to connect and move forward together . Ultimately , I'd like to promote a culture of high uplifting the low,and love overpowering hate.How would you encourage others to do their own part? For the past 10 outreach I've organized , I've been adopting the Pinoy value of " bayanihan " For every outreach ,I invite a handful of volunteers and donors to take part and chip in.I encourage the young to go out there and hold your own outreach . It's not all about material things all the time-its taking time ,sharing what you got ,laughing with the kids ,buying for the hardworking street vendors.Leave trails of smiles ,not trash.{legit answer please}&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;​</a>

FILIPINOS
By Judith Kempis
Filipinos are hardworking and responsible
Friendly to others and all hospitable
Good moral values and respectful most of all
With long-patience and all lovable.
Filipinos help each other, whether rich or poor
For those who need especially the neighbor
Filipinos are brave and pride they stand for
To protect and fight for country is worth dying for.
Filipinos are always smiling
Though some nation keeps on insulting
For being simple, low status of living
But heart and mind are of rich human being.
I am proud to be a Filipino, in blood and skin
The religion of Christianity in God we believed in
Our own mother tongue we use and for grandchildren
The culture and tradition from ancient till next generation.

                            13. Read the inspiring Filipino advocacies.Explain in three sentences how their advocacies help people.A.Diana Soto Dayal (Manila Street Love)What is your advocacy and it's significance ? My advocacy is to bring back love and joy to the streets- with focus on the homeless kids and senior citizens.Theres been a rubble of blood , hopelessness , darkness on our streets and with Manila street love,we try to introduce some light and love via our mobile outreach and campaigns.Why is it important to me? I drive around the streets almost every day and I don't really see much help is given.We forget they are people too and if we can make an impact at the moment why not? If we want to develop as a society ,we need to connect and move forward together . Ultimately , I'd like to promote a culture of high uplifting the low,and love overpowering hate.How would you encourage others to do their own part? For the past 10 outreach I've organized , I've been adopting the Pinoy value of " bayanihan " For every outreach ,I invite a handful of volunteers and donors to take part and chip in.I encourage the young to go out there and hold your own outreach . It's not all about material things all the time-its taking time ,sharing what you got ,laughing with the kids ,buying for the hardworking street vendors.Leave trails of smiles ,not trash.{legit answer please}&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;​</h2><br />
                        <p>It enables people, particularly those on the streets, to rediscover love and joy. It was stated that if we want to develop as a society, we must connect and help one another rather than degrade people on the streets. It also encourages people to be nice.</p><p></p><br />

                            14. Ethnocentrism is a worldview that can be observed in several countries. To see this, research on how the concept of ethnocentrism is being observed or done in the United States of America, Japan, China and United Kingdom. Provide one example in each country then answer the following questions. 1. What did you discover after your research? 2. Can you see some observations similar to our own culture? Alternative Q: Which countries have similar ethnocentric views with us? Which countries have different ethnocentric views with us? 3. Why do you think they have these ethnocentric practices? What benefit can they get from doing these? 4. As a Filipino, what practices or values you are proud of that are worth sharing with others? 5. How will you promote these values and practices?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>USA: The concept of American exceptionalism is an example of ethnocentrism in the United States. It refers to the belief that the United States is inherently superior to other countries in terms of political, economic, and social systems.</p><p></p><p>Japan: The idea of "nihonjinron" (Japanese uniqueness) is a form of ethnocentrism in Japan. It is a belief in the inherent superiority of Japanese culture, values, and customs.</p><p></p><p>China: Han nationalism is a form of ethnocentrism in China, which is based on the idea that the Han Chinese are the dominant and superior ethnic group in China, and other ethnic minorities should assimilate to Han culture.</p><p></p><p>United Kingdom: British exceptionalism is a form of ethnocentrism in the United Kingdom, which refers to the belief that the United Kingdom is unique and superior to other countries in terms of its history, culture, and values.</p><p></p><p>1. Through my research, I discovered that ethnocentrism is a pervasive worldview that can be observed in several countries, including the United States, Japan, China, and the United Kingdom. Each country has its unique form of ethnocentrism, but they all share a belief in the superiority of their culture, values, and customs.</p><p></p><p>2. As a Filipino, I can observe similarities in ethnocentric views with the United States, as both countries have a belief in their inherent superiority. However, the Philippines has a more collectivist culture, while the United States is more individualistic. Countries with different ethnocentric views from the Philippines may include Japan and China, which have a stronger sense of national identity based on their cultural heritage.</p><p></p><p>3. Ethnocentric practices may arise from a desire to maintain cultural identity and a sense of belongingness. It may also serve as a way to differentiate oneself from other cultures and assert one's dominance. These practices can provide a sense of pride and identity for the individual and the group.</p><p></p><p>4. As a Filipino, I am proud of our strong family ties, hospitality, and resilience. These values are worth sharing with others as they promote social cohesion, kindness, and perseverance.</p><p></p><p>5. To promote these values, I can share stories and experiences that highlight the importance of family, community, and compassion. I can also participate in community events that celebrate Filipino culture and traditions, such as food festivals and cultural dances. Additionally, I can encourage others to learn more about Filipino history and culture to foster greater understanding and appreciation of our values.</p><p></p><br />
