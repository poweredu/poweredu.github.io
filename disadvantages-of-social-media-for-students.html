(2) This is because online learning eliminates the cost points of student transportation, student meals, and most importantly, real estate.   (3) Additionally, all the course or study materials are available online, thus creating a paperless learning environment which is more affordable, while also being beneficial to the environment.   (4) For many students, one of the biggest challenges of online learning is the struggle with focusing on the screen for long periods of time. (5) With online learning, there is also a greater chance for students to be easily distracted by social media or other sites.

They can also use this platform to spread and share news/knowledge to other people. They may also use this for appropriate entertainment purposes. Now for the disadvantages, social media is very prone for bullying. Many ignorant users would try to crash your confidence and other aspect by using your insecurities against you, they may also try to make you feel ashamed of yourself through verbal bullying. As what I've said earlier, they can use their platforms to spread news, but these news could still possibly be fake and may lead to lots of misunderstandings. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This is just based on my own opinion so you can correct me if I'm wrong and also, sorry if there are any grammatical errors.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social media is abundant with knowledge and information. Through social media, I can becine more well-informed and learn a lot of things that may help me in my studies, as it is filled with people that can help me grow as both a student and a person. However, it is also a dangerous territory to venture. As much as it is filled with knowledgeable people and a lot of useful nformation, it is also rampant with people that can tear me down and teach me all the wrong things, along with a lot of false or harmful information that can cause me to get hurt. It is informative and entertaining, but also addictive and dangerous. As a student, it is important that I learn to manage my social media intake and how I use it.</p><p></p><br />
