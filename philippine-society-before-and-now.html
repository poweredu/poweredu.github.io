Take note of the important details to be able to fill out the table that follows.A :3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 ahter geling vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19.Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus o day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Moristella Abenojor says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccino on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the Immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solanle explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help light the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder thern from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite lirnited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin, B :CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 B Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Agullar - Reporter / KAquilarina INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14.2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of grolllude" to them, We have a stand here and I want to stato it here and now again.

                                            MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
they’re drinking. HOPE IT HELPS</a>

                                            ACTIVITY 1: You be the Judge of it! Though it seems that society is winning in the battle against illegal drug use and abuse, I believe that we are still a long way from declaring victory in the battle. Teenagers are still victimized by drug addiction. Everyone complains? But only a few are some suggestions to stop this terrible and frightening habit. First, the film industry should stop glamorizing drug addiction. Drug addicts and drug pushers should not come out as heroes and saints in films and television programs. They should realize that young people look up to these actors and actresses and what they portray on camera is something that looks cool and good for the young viewers. The government and the actors' guild should come up with a law banning the industry from showing drugs of all forms on television and film. Second, the government should have strict laws and policies on drug trafficking and possession of drugs and their paraphernalia. We should follow our neighboring countries which include death penalties as sanction to drug traffickers. Right now, the Philippines serve as a drop-off point for drugs coming from other countries. Drug Laboratories have been discovered in residential houses and old abandoned factories. Foreign members of syndicates have been caught and charged by authorities. These are proofs that there is a need to review and revise our present laws on drug abuse and trafficking. Third, horrific videos of people dying from drug-related illnesses should be used by the government as advocacy materials for students to see and know the real deal about drug use and abuse. If students will understand the ugly truth about drugs through these advocacies and they will no longer start to take drugs, then the approach will be effective and the experience worthwhile. There are still more ideas I can share with you regarding drug abuse prevention but I think that these three suggestions are more than enough to change the scenario. My parting words are to "think several times before acting out foolishly". The Editor - 1. Questions: What are the ideas of the editor to stop drug use, abuse, and drug trafficking? Summarize these ideas. 2. Do you think the idea of the editor will be effective? Why or why not? 3. Do you have other ideas that might help stop drug use, abuse, and trafficking? Write one idea in each box.​</a>

A. 3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 after getting vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus a day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Maristella Abenojar says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccine on March 1s and even administered vaccines or assisted in the immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solante explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help fight the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder them from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite limited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin. CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021B. Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Aguilar - Reporter / @KAquilarINQ INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14, 2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of gratitude" to them. "We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. Na yung mga barko natin nandyan ngayon sa Pag-asa at saan po, we will not move an inch backward." Duterte said in the second part of his taped speech aired Friday. (We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. That our ships are there in Pag-asa Island and somewhere else, we will not move an inch backward.) "Ayoko mokipagaway nga sa China, Inuulit ko, may utang ng loob kami. Malaki, malaki ang utang ng loob. Buhay ang tinulong nya sa amin. Pero yung ano naman ng bayan namin, sana maintindihan ninyo," he added, (I don't want to quarrel with China, I repeat, we have a debt of gratitude. A big one. They helped us with our lives. But I hope you understand the interest of our nation.) Duterte noted this is "what's supposed to be done by any president of any self-respecting republic." In the same televised speech, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told Duterte the country's assets are deployed at the Kalayaan Island Group. "I'd like to put notice on China. May dalawang barko ako dyan...Sabihin ko sa China ngayon, as I said before, I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel, I don't want trouble, I respect your position and you respect mine," Duterte said. (I have two ships there. Let me tell China now, as I said before. I am not ready to withdraw. I don't want a quarrel. I don't want trouble. I respect your position and you respect mine.) The President sold it is not wrong to admit that the Philippines is "inferior" in terms of "might and power." "Ngayon, hindi talaga ako aatras. Patayin mo man ako dito ako. Dito magtapos ang ating pagkakaibigan," he went on. (Now, I really won't withdraw. Even if you kill me. I will be here. This is when the friendship ends.) The Issuea.b. The Speaker's Standa.b.

Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019. On 30 January 2020, the Philippine Department of Health reportedthe first case of COVID-19 in the country with a 38-year-old female Chinese national.On 7 March, the first local transmission of COVID-19was confirmed. WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2. What writing technique used from each of the given texts?3. How do these various writing techniques help you in your writing?​</a>

                                            DUTERTE ADMIN PROVIDED TO SPED UP COVID 19 MASS TESTING AMID EXTENDED LOCKDOWN ( by: Gabriel Pabico Lalu-Reporter/@GabrielLalunINQINQUIRER.net/09:51 PM
MANILA, Philippines- The government should take advantage of the latest extension of the COVID-19 lockdown over the National Capital Region and other areas by speeding up its mass testing procedures.
This was the call of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), stressing that the Duterte Administration should "rectify serious short comings" in its fight against pandemic.
"Government should step up mass testing not just in terms of the total number of tests but more so in terms of the concentration or focus on the tests, the areas that have a high incidence of COVID 19,"Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said in a statement.
"The necessary health and economic measures have long been lacking in the areas under ECQ which is the reason why another extension is now being imposed. The government must also rectify theses serious shortcomings towards the eventual lifting of the ECQ," he added.
The national government on Tuesday extended the enhanced community quarantine -albeit "modified"- in NCR , Cebu City and Laguna province until May 31 as these areas are still considered "high risk" for COVID 19 transmission and placed dozens of provinces deemed to have "moderate rsk"for virus spread under the general community quarantine (GCQ) from May 16.
Meanwhile, the national government is set to remove quarantine measures in areas considered "low-risk" for COVID 19 transmission by May 16.
Reyes said the government must still ensure that health measures are in place and personal protective equipment lie facemask must remain available across the country amid loosened quarantine classifications.
"The lifting of the ECQ and the transition to GCQ in many provinces still necessitates timey health interventions as the population prepares to return to work," he explained.
"The health of the work force must be ensured. Face masks should be made free. Employers should shoulder the cost of mass testing of their workforce. Transportation which was already lacking even before the ECQ should be made available for the workforce, "he added.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque previously admitted that the government missed out on its April 30 goal of having 8,000 tests per day but also said that the "by hook or by crook, " the country will do the COVID 19 test of 30,000 a day by the end of May. Calls for the government to urgently move to adopt a policy on mass testing started in March.
DOH data on May 10 showed that 173, 352 individuals have tested for possible coronavirus infection by various testing sites, with 15,002 initially testing positive.
And despite the easing of quarantine regulations, DOH has admitted that they have yet to control the spread of the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, which causes respiratory illness COVID 19, reminding people to still observe health protocols to avert mass infections.
As of Tuesday, DOH said the Philippines has 11, 350 SARS CoV-2 infections as well as 751 deaths and 2, 106 recoveries from COVID 19.

Take note of the important details to be able to fill out the table that follows.A :3 nurses test positive for COVID-19 ahter geling vaccine Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19.Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus o day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in. Filipino Nurses United President Moristella Abenojor says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccino on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the Immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solanle explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That's when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help light the infection. Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder thern from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite lirnited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor's assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. - Carolyn Bonquin, B :CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 B Duterte to China: PH won't withdraw ships from West Philippine Sea By: Krissy Agullar - Reporter / KAquilarina INQUIRER.net/01:35 PM May 14.2021 MANILA, Philippines - President Rodrigo Duterte has declared that the Philippines will not withdraw its assets from the disputed parts of the West Philippine Sea while also insisting he does not intend to quarrel with China due to the country's "debt of grolllude" to them, We have a stand here and I want to stato it here and now again.

                            4. MANILA, Philippines – Buying drinking water from refilling stations has
become the most common way of obtaining clean and safe drinking water.
There are now more than 20,000 water refilling stations in the country,
where up to 40% of households nationwide and 60% of Metro Manila
residents buy drinking water.
Proactivity is encouraged for consumers to get the cleanest
drinking water possible. As a research study from the Pediatric Infectious
Disease Society of the Philippines puts it, “Characteristics of the [water
refilling] stations such as the disinfection method, frequency of
monitoring, personnel hygiene, attire and practices all affect the safety
and potability of the product water.”
Water refilling stations are required by law to adhere to the
Department of Health (DOH) Implementing Rules and Regulations of the
Sanitation Code of the Philippines, stipulated in Presidential Decree
856.
Chapter 2 on water supply, as outlined in the DOH regulations,
requires that all water refilling stations must be located at least 25 meters
away from any direct source of pollution, and not in an area subject to
flooding. Proprietors are required to have water samples tested by a DOHaccredited laboratory to comply with the Philippine National Standards
for Drinking Water (PNSDW).
In addition, the DOH has specific rules on how refilling stations
should prepare, refill, handle, store and deliver water. Water containers
must be properly sanitized before filling them with purified water, using
DOH-approved sanitizing solution to disinfect the container from germs.
Washing the container with merely water and soap is insufficient.
The DOH also demands all personnel to wear protective gear such
as gloves, face masks, hair nets, and scrub suits to prevent purified water
from coming into contact with any part of the body.
Refilled water for delivery is then transferred into sanitized
transports that ensure water is maintained at room temperature (25C28C). Delivery vehicles that leave the containers exposed to dust,
pollution, heat and direct sunlight are not acceptable.
Alternatively, there are also in-home water purifiers, which have
the advantage of eliminating the need for manual handling and transport
of the water. In fact, the World Health Organization (WHO) and the United
Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF) have endorsed household treatment of
water through point-of-use purifiers as an effective strategy to avoid
water-borne diseases.
Dr. Molina also encourages citizens to be vigilant about what
they’re drinking. HOPE IT HELPS</h2><br />

                            8. ACTIVITY 1: You be the Judge of it! Though it seems that society is winning in the battle against illegal drug use and abuse, I believe that we are still a long way from declaring victory in the battle. Teenagers are still victimized by drug addiction. Everyone complains? But only a few are some suggestions to stop this terrible and frightening habit. First, the film industry should stop glamorizing drug addiction. Drug addicts and drug pushers should not come out as heroes and saints in films and television programs. They should realize that young people look up to these actors and actresses and what they portray on camera is something that looks cool and good for the young viewers. The government and the actors' guild should come up with a law banning the industry from showing drugs of all forms on television and film. Second, the government should have strict laws and policies on drug trafficking and possession of drugs and their paraphernalia. We should follow our neighboring countries which include death penalties as sanction to drug traffickers. Right now, the Philippines serve as a drop-off point for drugs coming from other countries. Drug Laboratories have been discovered in residential houses and old abandoned factories. Foreign members of syndicates have been caught and charged by authorities. These are proofs that there is a need to review and revise our present laws on drug abuse and trafficking. Third, horrific videos of people dying from drug-related illnesses should be used by the government as advocacy materials for students to see and know the real deal about drug use and abuse. If students will understand the ugly truth about drugs through these advocacies and they will no longer start to take drugs, then the approach will be effective and the experience worthwhile. There are still more ideas I can share with you regarding drug abuse prevention but I think that these three suggestions are more than enough to change the scenario. My parting words are to "think several times before acting out foolishly". The Editor - 1. Questions: What are the ideas of the editor to stop drug use, abuse, and drug trafficking? Summarize these ideas. 2. Do you think the idea of the editor will be effective? Why or why not? 3. Do you have other ideas that might help stop drug use, abuse, and trafficking?

"We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. Na yung mga barko natin nandyan ngayon sa Pag-asa at saan po, we will not move an inch backward." Duterte said in the second part of his taped speech aired Friday. (We have a stand here and I want to state it here and now again. That our ships are there in Pag-asa Island and somewhere else, we will not move an inch backward.) "Ayoko mokipagaway nga sa China, Inuulit ko, may utang ng loob kami.

Pero yung ano naman ng bayan namin, sana maintindihan ninyo," he added, (I don't want to quarrel with China, I repeat, we have a debt of gratitude. A big one. They helped us with our lives. But I hope you understand the interest of our nation.) Duterte noted this is "what's supposed to be done by any president of any self-respecting republic." In the same televised speech, Defense Secretary Delfin Lorenzana told Duterte the country's assets are deployed at the Kalayaan Island Group. "I'd like to put notice on China. May dalawang barko ako dyan...Sabihin ko sa China ngayon, as I said before, I am not ready to withdraw.

Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019. On 30 January 2020, the Philippine Department of Health reportedthe first case of COVID-19 in the country with a 38-year-old female Chinese national.On 7 March, the first local transmission of COVID-19was confirmed. WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently.

                            11. DUTERTE ADMIN PROVIDED TO SPED UP COVID 19 MASS TESTING AMID EXTENDED LOCKDOWN ( by: Gabriel Pabico Lalu-Reporter/@GabrielLalunINQINQUIRER.net/09:51 PM
MANILA, Philippines- The government should take advantage of the latest extension of the COVID-19 lockdown over the National Capital Region and other areas by speeding up its mass testing procedures.
This was the call of the Bagong Alyansang Makabayan (Bayan), stressing that the Duterte Administration should "rectify serious short comings" in its fight against pandemic.
"Government should step up mass testing not just in terms of the total number of tests but more so in terms of the concentration or focus on the tests, the areas that have a high incidence of COVID 19,"Bayan secretary-general Renato Reyes said in a statement.
"The necessary health and economic measures have long been lacking in the areas under ECQ which is the reason why another extension is now being imposed. The government must also rectify theses serious shortcomings towards the eventual lifting of the ECQ," he added.
The national government on Tuesday extended the enhanced community quarantine -albeit "modified"- in NCR , Cebu City and Laguna province until May 31 as these areas are still considered "high risk" for COVID 19 transmission and placed dozens of provinces deemed to have "moderate rsk"for virus spread under the general community quarantine (GCQ) from May 16.
Meanwhile, the national government is set to remove quarantine measures in areas considered "low-risk" for COVID 19 transmission by May 16.
Reyes said the government must still ensure that health measures are in place and personal protective equipment lie facemask must remain available across the country amid loosened quarantine classifications.
"The lifting of the ECQ and the transition to GCQ in many provinces still necessitates timey health interventions as the population prepares to return to work," he explained.
"The health of the work force must be ensured. Face masks should be made free. Employers should shoulder the cost of mass testing of their workforce. Transportation which was already lacking even before the ECQ should be made available for the workforce, "he added.
Presidential spokesperson Harry Roque previously admitted that the government missed out on its April 30 goal of having 8,000 tests per day but also said that the "by hook or by crook, " the country will do the COVID 19 test of 30,000 a day by the end of May. Calls for the government to urgently move to adopt a policy on mass testing started in March.
DOH data on May 10 showed that 173, 352 individuals have tested for possible coronavirus infection by various testing sites, with 15,002 initially testing positive.
And despite the easing of quarantine regulations, DOH has admitted that they have yet to control the spread of the novel coronavirus or SARS-CoV-2, which causes respiratory illness COVID 19, reminding people to still observe health protocols to avert mass infections.
As of Tuesday, DOH said the Philippines has 11, 350 SARS CoV-2 infections as well as 751 deaths and 2, 106 recoveries from COVID 19.

( 20 points ) 3 NURSES TEST POSITIVE FOR COVID-19 AFTER GETTING VACCINE        Three nurses who received a Sinovac vaccine are now in quarantine after testing positive for COVID-19. Infectious Diseases Specialist, Dr. Rontgene Solante, explains an infection is still possible if the person had the virus a day or two before getting vaccinated or when exposed to the virus before the antibodies kicked in.      Filipino Nurses United President Maristella Abenojar says the nurses got the Sinovac vaccine on March 1st and even administered vaccines or assisted in the immunization program. They were swabbed after a week and tested positive on March 9. They are asymptomatic. Dr. Solante explains that a person will only get some protection from the virus on the second week after vaccination. That’s when the body would have started producing enough antibodies to help fight the infection.        Almost 216,000 frontline health workers got the first dose of Sinovac and AstraZeneca vaccines. The Filipino Nurses United is calling for paid leave if they experience any side effect which could hinder them from working. Meanwhile, the Filipino Infectious Diseases Society for Obstetrics and Gynecology says pregnant women who are at high risk of exposure to COVID-19 infection as well as lactating mothers may receive a COVID-19 vaccine despite limited studies on its safety and efficacy, but this is still upon doctor’s assessment and should only be offered to pregnant and breastfeeding women at high-risk groups such as frontline health workers and uniformed personnel. They recommend it during the second or third trimester of pregnancy. Doctors say those who have just given birth may also be vaccinated against COVID-19, but they must wait two weeks after receiving a different type of vaccine like anti-tetanus or flu shots. – Carolyn Bonquin, CNN Philippines, Mar. 17, 2021 Answer the following : 1.
