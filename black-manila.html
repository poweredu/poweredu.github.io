Instruction: Read the Story provided below and write a critique (300-500 words) using a CRITICAL Black Nazarene Procession Awes American Tourist battle through By: Julliane Love De Jesus January 9th, 2014 ALLANILA, Philippines—l's not only local devotees who would travel for miles and a sea of ecstatic devotees just to touch the centuries-old black statue of Jesus Christ known as the Black Nazarene. Some foreigners do, too. American tourist Gerry Blevins got a baptism of fire when he was lured to the He said touching the Black Nazarene image gave him a tough time, but added that "people just got to have the patience.” "It's a once in a lifetime thing. You only get one chance to do it," he told INQUIRER.net. As the procession kicked off at Quirino Grandstand on Thursday morning, the crowd swelled in minutes and Blevins was among those who swarmed to the carriage. A native of Delaware state, the American national said he came to the Philippines for his Filipina girlfriend and that it was his first time to participate in the Black Nazarene procession. “At first, when I got here at 1 p.m. there's just insanity trying to get to touch the Black Nazarene," he jokingly said. Blevins chose not to take off his shoes for fear of hurting his feet when he joined the procession that trudged through garbage-strewn route of Nazarene's journey. Just for a little thrill, Blevins said he climbed a tree to capture the Black Nazarene being revered by millions of devotees in the most unusual way. But despite the raucous crowd, he said he still believes that the Philippines is "much nicer (place) than the United States." The wooden statue of Christ, crowned with thorns and bearing a cross, is believed to have been brought from Mexico to Manila on a galleon in 1606 by Spanish missionaries. The ship that carried it caught fire, but the charred statue survived and was named the Black Nazarene. Some believe the statue's survival of fires and earthquakes through the centuries, and intense bombings during World War II, are a testament to its mystical powers.​</a>

                                            Text C (10 pts) Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, January 20)-COVID-19 response deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said Wednesday the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management Emerging Infectious Diseases would assess by end of January whether the current age restrictions can be eased. Dizon was reacting to a report on the proposal of the Trade Department to allow 10-year-old children to go out of their homes to help stimulate economic activity. Current IATF rules permit those aged 15 to 65 years old to stay outdoors. Meanwhile, those covered by the age restrictions could only leave their houses to access essential items and services. The official said the decision will mainly depend on whether the holidays and Black Nazarene festivities triggered a surge in the number of COVID - 19 cases. The Department of Health earlier said it expects to know about the possible impact of holiday gatherings and the Black Nazarene feast celebration this month. "Tingin ko po (I think) by end of Jan. or Feb., it will be reevaluated and we will see if we can ease some more depending on what happens to our cases," Dizon told the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum. Devotees were earlier allowed to attend mass celebrations in Quiapo Church for the Feast of the Black Nazarene on Jan. 9. Masses were held in lieu of the Traslacion or grand procession of the Black Nazarene image, which traditionally draws millions of Catholic faithful. Experts have warned of a spike in coronavirus cases which might lead to stricter movement restrictions after up to 400,000 devotees visited the Quiapo area on the eve and on the day of the Black Nazarene feast. Dizon said they will also consider their experts' advice on this matter, noting that most of the IATF advisers are medical professionals. "I think when our medical advisers come to a point where they are comfortable na (that) it will not cause a tremendous risk to the general population, then restrictions on age will be slowly eased as well," he said.

Instruction: Read the Story provided below and write a critique (300-500 words) using a CRITICAL Black Nazarene Procession Awes American Tourist battle through By: Julliane Love De Jesus January 9th, 2014 ALLANILA, Philippines—l's not only local devotees who would travel for miles and a sea of ecstatic devotees just to touch the centuries-old black statue of Jesus Christ known as the Black Nazarene. Some foreigners do, too. American tourist Gerry Blevins got a baptism of fire when he was lured to the He said touching the Black Nazarene image gave him a tough time, but added that "people just got to have the patience.” "It's a once in a lifetime thing. You only get one chance to do it," he told INQUIRER.net. As the procession kicked off at Quirino Grandstand on Thursday morning, the crowd swelled in minutes and Blevins was among those who swarmed to the carriage. A native of Delaware state, the American national said he came to the Philippines for his Filipina girlfriend and that it was his first time to participate in the Black Nazarene procession. “At first, when I got here at 1 p.m. there's just insanity trying to get to touch the Black Nazarene," he jokingly said. Blevins chose not to take off his shoes for fear of hurting his feet when he joined the procession that trudged through garbage-strewn route of Nazarene's journey. Just for a little thrill, Blevins said he climbed a tree to capture the Black Nazarene being revered by millions of devotees in the most unusual way. But despite the raucous crowd, he said he still believes that the Philippines is "much nicer (place) than the United States." The wooden statue of Christ, crowned with thorns and bearing a cross, is believed to have been brought from Mexico to Manila on a galleon in 1606 by Spanish missionaries. The ship that carried it caught fire, but the charred statue survived and was named the Black Nazarene. Some believe the statue's survival of fires and earthquakes through the centuries, and intense bombings during World War II, are a testament to its mystical powers.​</h2><br />

                            22. Text C (10 pts) Metro Manila (CNN Philippines, January 20)-COVID-19 response deputy chief implementer Vince Dizon said Wednesday the Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management Emerging Infectious Diseases would assess by end of January whether the current age restrictions can be eased. Dizon was reacting to a report on the proposal of the Trade Department to allow 10-year-old children to go out of their homes to help stimulate economic activity. Current IATF rules permit those aged 15 to 65 years old to stay outdoors. Meanwhile, those covered by the age restrictions could only leave their houses to access essential items and services. The official said the decision will mainly depend on whether the holidays and Black Nazarene festivities triggered a surge in the number of COVID - 19 cases. The Department of Health earlier said it expects to know about the possible impact of holiday gatherings and the Black Nazarene feast celebration this month. "Tingin ko po (I think) by end of Jan. or Feb., it will be reevaluated and we will see if we can ease some more depending on what happens to our cases," Dizon told the Kapihan sa Manila Bay forum. Devotees were earlier allowed to attend mass celebrations in Quiapo Church for the Feast of the Black Nazarene on Jan. 9. Masses were held in lieu of the Traslacion or grand procession of the Black Nazarene image, which traditionally draws millions of Catholic faithful. Experts have warned of a spike in coronavirus cases which might lead to stricter movement restrictions after up to 400,000 devotees visited the Quiapo area on the eve and on the day of the Black Nazarene feast. Dizon said they will also consider their experts' advice on this matter, noting that most of the IATF advisers are medical professionals. "I think when our medical advisers come to a point where they are comfortable na (that) it will not cause a tremendous risk to the general population, then restrictions on age will be slowly eased as well," he said.
