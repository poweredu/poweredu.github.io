Curbing Bad Behavior: App Seeks to Harness Overbilling by
Contractors (An Excerpt)
By NewsUSA
Those contractors routinely overbill governments at the expense of taxpayers may come as no surprise. That these over billings likely total hundreds of billions of dollars should shock and infuriate us all.  
Consider the recent example involving the city of New York
and its contractor called SAIC. In 2000, New York City contracted
SAIC for a project called City Time, an employee time management
system budgeted at $73 million. After flagrant overbilling and
kickbacks, the total project cost had ballooned to over $600 million. In 2005, an SAIC whistleblower alerted authorities about this massive overbilling. This led to a criminal fraud charge, and, in March of this year, SAIC (now called Leidos) admitted wrongdoing and agreed to a settlement of over half a million dollars.

                                            make your own news report in a video presentationMany urban communities are now besieged by illegal drugs. Fears of gang violence and muggings keep frightened residents at home. Even at home, citizens feel insecure, for drug-related break-ins and burglaries threaten. Open dealing on the street stirs the community's fears for its children. The police sometimes seem overwhelmed. Occasionally they are outgunned. More often, they are simply overmatched by the resilience of the drug commerce. Furthermore, their potential impact is neutralized by the incapacity of the courts and penal system to mete out deserved punishments. Urgent problems and limited resources demand managerial thought for their resolution. Thus, police executives facing the drug problem might usefully consider four strategic questions: What goals might reasonably be set for drug enforcement? What parts of the police department engage the drug problem and to what effect? What role can citizens and community groups usefully (and properly) play in coping with the problem? What basic strategies might the police department consider as alternative attacks on the problem? The goals of drug enforcement From a police chief's perspective, the drug problem presents distinguishable threats to community security. Most pressing is the violence associated with street-level drug dealing-This is one in a series of reports originally developed with some of the leading figures in American policing during their periodic meetings at Hanard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The reports are published so that Americans interested in the improvement and the future of policing can share in the information and perspectives that were part of extensive debates at the School's Executive Session on Policing. The police chiefs, mayors, scholars, and others invited to the meetings have focused on the use and promise of such strategies as community-based and problem-oriented policing. The testing and adoption of these strategies by some police agencies signal important changes in the way American policing now does business. What these changes mean for the welfare of citizens and the fulfillment of the police mission in the next decades has been at the heart of the Kennedy School meetings and this series of papers. We hope that through these publications police officials and other policymakers who affect the course of policing will debate and challenge their beliefs just as those of us in the Executive Session have done. The Executive Session on Policing has been developed and administered by the Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management and funded by the National Institute of Justice and private sources that include the Charles Stewart Mott and Guggenheim Foundations.

                                            Example ScenarioThe College of Information Technology and Computer Studies has a large numberof student population in the university. Managing an IT student and bringing togetherdepartments and other colleges to achieve the mission is always a big challenge for theThe management. Most are transferees, irregular students and with failed subjectaffected in this situation because they need to provide a copy of grades during advisingperiod and manually write it on the evaluation checklist to monitor their performancegrade in every semester before processing the enrolment.The college coordinators who have an access to verify, update and monitoring thestudent checklists. This checklist is used to back-up the Microsoft Access database thatuses to record the advising record. During the enrolment, the coordinators runs a reportthat will print out the evaluation checklist for the day. Not only does to maintain theevaluation database, but it also uses a copy of grades to validate the grade of the student.Although the MIS enrolment system supports the student viewing of gradesinformation, the Coordinators has noticed some drawbacks. On particular situation the evaluation for the courses have conflicted with missing subject to enrol due toCurriculum used by the student and will cause to failure of completion to the courseprogram. CITCS will like to get information about the automatic assessment of thestudent evaluation of grades per semester. They have been talking about either updating the system or replacing it with a newinformation system that would meet the current and future needs but needs more detailson which option is feasible for the advising procedures. Your tasks is to help come upwith a plan to address these issues.Project AnalysisWrite one-page review and observation in the CITCS Advisingprocedures for enrolment with the intent of improving it through standardmethodology. For this study, provide some discretion as to how would like tostructure the presentation and must address the following requirements abouteach step in the systems analysis design process: a. Planning: Define the scope of the problem.b. Requirements: Justify the functional requirements. Explain what documentation will be used to analyze the needs of the end users to ensure the new system can meet their expectations?c. Design: Use the information that you received from the system requirement documentation to explain how you will design the new or updated system. What are the necessary specifications and operations of the user interface that will meet the functional requirements? Will you use a Flowchart or any presentation diagram.</a>

Curbing Bad Behavior: App Seeks to Harness Overbilling by
Contractors (An Excerpt)
By NewsUSA
Those contractors routinely overbill governments at the expense of taxpayers may come as no surprise. That these over billings likely total hundreds of billions of dollars should shock and infuriate us all.  
Consider the recent example involving the city of New York
and its contractor called SAIC. In 2000, New York City contracted
SAIC for a project called City Time, an employee time management
system budgeted at $73 million. After flagrant overbilling and
kickbacks, the total project cost had ballooned to over $600 million. In 2005, an SAIC whistleblower alerted authorities about this massive overbilling. This led to a criminal fraud charge, and, in March of this year, SAIC (now called Leidos) admitted wrongdoing and agreed to a settlement of over half a million dollars.

                            29. make your own news report in a video presentationMany urban communities are now besieged by illegal drugs. Fears of gang violence and muggings keep frightened residents at home. Even at home, citizens feel insecure, for drug-related break-ins and burglaries threaten. Open dealing on the street stirs the community's fears for its children. The police sometimes seem overwhelmed. Occasionally they are outgunned. More often, they are simply overmatched by the resilience of the drug commerce. Furthermore, their potential impact is neutralized by the incapacity of the courts and penal system to mete out deserved punishments. Urgent problems and limited resources demand managerial thought for their resolution. Thus, police executives facing the drug problem might usefully consider four strategic questions: What goals might reasonably be set for drug enforcement? What parts of the police department engage the drug problem and to what effect? What role can citizens and community groups usefully (and properly) play in coping with the problem? What basic strategies might the police department consider as alternative attacks on the problem? The goals of drug enforcement From a police chief's perspective, the drug problem presents distinguishable threats to community security. Most pressing is the violence associated with street-level drug dealing-This is one in a series of reports originally developed with some of the leading figures in American policing during their periodic meetings at Hanard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. The reports are published so that Americans interested in the improvement and the future of policing can share in the information and perspectives that were part of extensive debates at the School's Executive Session on Policing. The police chiefs, mayors, scholars, and others invited to the meetings have focused on the use and promise of such strategies as community-based and problem-oriented policing. The testing and adoption of these strategies by some police agencies signal important changes in the way American policing now does business. What these changes mean for the welfare of citizens and the fulfillment of the police mission in the next decades has been at the heart of the Kennedy School meetings and this series of papers. We hope that through these publications police officials and other policymakers who affect the course of policing will debate and challenge their beliefs just as those of us in the Executive Session have done. The Executive Session on Policing has been developed and administered by the Kennedy School's Program in Criminal Justice Policy and Management and funded by the National Institute of Justice and private sources that include the Charles Stewart Mott and Guggenheim Foundations.

                            30. Example ScenarioThe College of Information Technology and Computer Studies has a large numberof student population in the university. Managing an IT student and bringing togetherdepartments and other colleges to achieve the mission is always a big challenge for theThe management. Most are transferees, irregular students and with failed subjectaffected in this situation because they need to provide a copy of grades during advisingperiod and manually write it on the evaluation checklist to monitor their performancegrade in every semester before processing the enrolment.The college coordinators who have an access to verify, update and monitoring thestudent checklists. This checklist is used to back-up the Microsoft Access database thatuses to record the advising record. During the enrolment, the coordinators runs a reportthat will print out the evaluation checklist for the day. Not only does to maintain theevaluation database, but it also uses a copy of grades to validate the grade of the student.Although the MIS enrolment system supports the student viewing of gradesinformation, the Coordinators has noticed some drawbacks. On particular situation the evaluation for the courses have conflicted with missing subject to enrol due toCurriculum used by the student and will cause to failure of completion to the courseprogram. CITCS will like to get information about the automatic assessment of thestudent evaluation of grades per semester. They have been talking about either updating the system or replacing it with a newinformation system that would meet the current and future needs but needs more detailson which option is feasible for the advising procedures. Your tasks is to help come upwith a plan to address these issues.Project AnalysisWrite one-page review and observation in the CITCS Advisingprocedures for enrolment with the intent of improving it through standardmethodology. For this study, provide some discretion as to how would like tostructure the presentation and must address the following requirements abouteach step in the systems analysis design process: a. Planning: Define the scope of the problem.b. Requirements: Justify the functional requirements. Explain what documentation will be used to analyze the needs of the end users to ensure the new system can meet their expectations?c. Design: Use the information that you received from the system requirement documentation to explain how you will design the new or updated system. What are the necessary specifications and operations of the user interface that will meet the functional requirements? Will you use a Flowchart or any presentation diagram.</h2><br />
