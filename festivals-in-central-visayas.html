                                            The Islands of Paradise
                                                                                               By: Richard Gula
          The Philippines is a sovereign state in archipelagic Southeast Asia and is home to an amazing collection of over 7,640 islands spanning more than 300,000 square kilometers of territory. These islands are divided into three regions namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.
           Luzon is the largest and the most populous island in the Philippines which is considered the 15th largest island in the world. It is the nation’s center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government’s national offices including the Malacañang Palace. It is also the home of mountainous terrains, picturesque volcanoes, numerous lakes, rivers, and plains. 
          Visayas is the smallest region in terms of land area in the central part of the archipelago. It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and MassKara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. 
          Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the “king of the fruits” which is the durian.
           All three islands are defined by their unique location, culture, and custom. The Philippines is indeed a paradise in its true sense</a>

These islands are divided into three regions namely Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao Luzon is the largest and the most populous island in the Philippines which is considered the 15th largest island in the world. It is the nation's center for economy and politics, being home to the country's big factories and government's national offices including the Malacañang Palace.

It is the home to major Philippine religious and cultural festivals such as Ati-atihan, Dinagyang, Sinulog, Pintados, and Masskara. It is also known for its famous landmarks such as the Chocolate Hills of Bohol, San Juanico Bridge of Leyte, and the island of Boracay. Mindanao is the second largest among the three islands in the southernmost part of the Philippines. It is the main contributor to the country's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in terms of agriculture, fishing, forestry, etc. Mindanao is known to be the home of the Philippine eagle and the "king of the fruits" which is the durian.
