                                            Look at this home, we need a new foundation
It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
All of me</a>

                                            Speech About Friendship Have you ever noticed that when a friend is happy you find yourself happy too, even when it has nothing to do with you? A true friend is like a mirror. Do you know why ? its because they reflect yourself. When I say that, I mean by emotionally, spiritually and much more. When you're happy, they're happy and when you're sad, they're feeling pretty much the same way you're feeling too. People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what a true friendship and love is. Friends do not have to be exactly the same, I mean, friends do have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship is not just to focus on the similarities but to accept each other's faults because true friends do not judge each other. Friends love unconditionally. They do have their little angry long moments from time to time but at the end of the day all is forgiven and forgotten. True friends are very rare to find but once you've found them, don't let them go because not everyone has true friends even if they're popular and famous. I hope all of you as my audience get the true meaning of friends because it's wonderful to be with such amazing friends. A B. Type of Speech (2 points each) 1. 5. 1. 5. 6. 2 6.

                                            Activity 4 Map It Out
At this time, let us see how well you know about text structure and graphic organizer.
DIRECTIONS. Read the passages below and identify how each is mainly structured. On a sheet of paper, put the information from each passage into the graphic organizer. The following graphic organizers are examples. Feel free to make changes if necessary.
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.

After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</a>

An important characteristic of a community is that the people are consciousbelonging to it.2. People make choice based on their values and attitudes.3. Where gossip is a strong force; there is little freedom to act or dress in ecceway4. Where a community knows each other well, by blood, affinity or friendshipbe miserable to put and conduct a business.5. We have to be aware when people speak or write as if the community, in itsideal.6. The meaning of a community is neither simple nor quikly defined7. There is no difference between sociology and anthropology since they studsame thing and use the same scientific methods.8. Learning any new ways of doing things require the learning of both news9.As a SHS student, you don't need to carefully observe changes in the community since not all the changes affect your life. 10.To be an an effective student mobilizer in the community, there is no need to know the nature of the community and how it behaves.

                                            If i were to ask you a question, will you be able to answer those accurately?It's all about life; reborn, reincarnation, or somewhat a timetravelling. I just want to explore through your minds, i wanna know what are your thoughts to the question i will ask for you. In addition, I want to be fair so I'm going to add an additional points ^^ so here's the question:REBORN1. In your past life, you died once. You were given a chance to live again in order to correct all those misunderstanding that has happened in the past. What will you do now that you have learned all the things that has happened to you? Will you just let bygones be bygones? answer.REINCARNATION2. You reincarnated not only once but twice, the reincarnation that has happened to you twice in your life was really unfortunate. You didn't do a good deeds thus you did a bad one. What happened to you in your first reincarnation has also fated to be the same as the second reincarnation. Now that you're reincarnated for the third time, will you correct all your mistakes that you have done in your past life now that you've given a another chance? Will you still do the same?(oof it's actually tiring to type this long uwu &gt;•&lt;)Now here comes the interesting one *inserting a devil smile* :&gt;TIMETRAVELLING3. Comes to the weird and unfamilliar surroundings, old but elegant things are displayed. You suddenly realized that you're not in your house but you're in SOMEBODY'S house. Elegant house, beautiful views ANNDD you have actually mistaken into someone. That someone is whom highly respected and you knew from the start that you actually don't know where you are now. You ask some people around you what date is it now and suddenly you were shocked by its answer. Now that it slipped through your mind that you are in TimeTravel, what will you do in order to go back in modern/old times? Will you continue to live in those period as someone? 3 question in a rowww HAHA. the last question is a little bit complicated but who knows whether you understand the question or not:&gt;. I just hope you will answer this honestly, you don't need to prove to me that you're a genius or whatever, what i need is if someone out there may answer this correctly or honestly it means that person has a great comprehension. no need to pressure yourself, I also just want to express my thoughts by asking these questions:)goodluck! thank you for giving me your time^^​</a>

Friends love unconditionally.

It may seem hopeless but we'll get by just fine
Look at this family, a glowing constellation
So full of stars and everybody wants to shine
But the stars don't shine, they burn
And the constellations shift
I think it's time you learn
You're more than just your gift
And I'm sorry I held on too tight
Just so afraid I'd lose you too
The miracle is not some magic that you've got
The miracle is you, not some gift, just you
The miracle is you
All of you, all of you
Okay, so we gonna talk about Bruno? (That's Bruno)
Yeah, there's a lot to say about Bruno
I'll start, okay
Pepa, I'm sorry 'bout your wedding, didn't mean to be upsetting
That wasn't a prophecy, I could just see you were sweating
And I wanted you to know that your bro loves you so
Let it in, let it out, let it rain, let it snow, let it go
That's what I'm always saying, bro
Got a lotta 'pologies I got to say
(Hey, we're just happy that you're here, okay?) Uh, But
Come into the light, the triplets all reunite
And no matter what happens we're gonna find our way
Yo, I knew he never left, I heard him every day
What's that sound? (Oh, oh)
I think it's everyone in town
Hey
Lay down your load (lay down your load)
We are only down the road (we are only down the road)
We have no gifts, but we are many
And we'll do anything for you
It's a dream when we work as a team (all of you, all of you)
You're so strong
Yeah, but sometimes I cry (all of you, all of you)
So do I
I may not be as strong but I'm getting wiser
Yeah, I need sunlight and fertilizer
Come on, let's plant something new and watch it fly
Straight up to the sky, let's go
The stars don't shine, they burn
The constellations glow
The seasons change in turn
Would you watch our little girl go?
She takes after you
Oh
Hey Mariano, why so blue?
I just have so much love inside
You know, I've got this cousin too
Have you met Dolores?
Okay, I'll take it from here, goodbye
You talk so loud
You take care of your mother and you make her proud
You write your own poetry every night when you go to sleep
And I'm seizing the moment, so would you wake up and notice me?
Dolores, I see you (and I hear you)
Yes (all of you, all of you)
Let's get married (slow down)
All of you, all of you
Home sweet home
I like the new foundation
It isn't perfect
Neither are we (that's true)
Just one more thing
Before the celebration (what?)
We need a doorknob
We made this one for you
We see how bright you burn
We see how brave you've been
Now, see yourself in turn
You're the real gift, kid, let us in
Open your eyes
Abre los ojos
What do you see?
I see me
All of me</h2><br />

                            10. Speech About Friendship Have you ever noticed that when a friend is happy you find yourself happy too, even when it has nothing to do with you? A true friend is like a mirror. Do you know why ? its because they reflect yourself. When I say that, I mean by emotionally, spiritually and much more. When you're happy, they're happy and when you're sad, they're feeling pretty much the same way you're feeling too. People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what a true friendship and love is. Friends do not have to be exactly the same, I mean, friends do have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship is not just to focus on the similarities but to accept each other's faults because true friends do not judge each other. Friends love unconditionally. They do have their little angry long moments from time to time but at the end of the day all is forgiven and forgotten. True friends are very rare to find but once you've found them, don't let them go because not everyone has true friends even if they're popular and famous. I hope all of you as my audience get the true meaning of friends because it's wonderful to be with such amazing friends. A B. Type of Speech (2 points each) 1. 5. 1. 5. 6. 2 6.

                            12. Activity 4 Map It Out
At this time, let us see how well you know about text structure and graphic organizer.
DIRECTIONS. Read the passages below and identify how each is mainly structured. On a sheet of paper, put the information from each passage into the graphic organizer. The following graphic organizers are examples. Feel free to make changes if necessary.
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.

After reading, evaluatethe short story using the criteria below. Then, Write a brief review in the comment section.Proud Little PencilBy Joemar L. Furigay"Pencils? They're very unfortunatel" mocked those bom with the privilege of ink."They're dull, too!" mimicked those born with the privilege of color."Truly unlucky!" they chorused in derisionLittle Pencil felt depressed upon hearing what the Pens and Crayons told about themPencils. True, he came from the Pencil family, and he was bound to carry out a Pencil's job. Andhe wasn't proud of thatIt was the role of Pencils to do the first part of any work. The Pens would then trace toperfection what the Pencils had started, leaving no traces of their initial efforts. Then, the Crayonswould brighten the Pens' work, making the Pencils go unnoticed. Such was the norm where thePens and the Crayons would be in the spotlight while the Pencils would always stay on thesidelinesLittle Pencil knew the Pencil family worked hard, but he couldn't understand why they werehappy even if they were underappreciated."Mom, I don't want to be a pencil anymore," he grumbled."Dear, you need to know that we Pencils are as good as the Pens and Crayons," hismother repliedThat's clearly untrue, Mom!" Little Pencil protested."W not true, then tell me why pens need us to create perfect lines?" Mother Pencil asked.Little Pencil replied with a sigh."Pens and crayons are unable to correct their mistakes while we, pencils, can," MotherPencil continued. We don'tget recognized most of the time, but it doesn't mean we can't shine,"she explained.Little Pencil mumbled, "But pens cover our marks, and crayons make them look alive.""But we guide them, dear son," Mother Pencil countered, "they can't produce great workswithout us starting them.""And that makes you independent because you don't need help to create something,"Mother Pencil explained."Pens, crayons and pencils have their own ups and downs, and believe me when I saywe're all the same," she said. "We pencils create, so do pens and crayons. We make mistakes,so do they.""But the Pens and the Crayons would always steal the credit!" Little Pencil complained,holding back his tears."But without us, they won't shine," Mother Pencil wiped his tears away. We are asimportant as they are. There's something better than being noticed, son."Little Pencil asked, "What could be better than being noticed, Mom?""It is knowing you have a purpose and believing you are more than what you appear tobe," Mother Pencil answered."You yourself should know how important you are and how beautiful your role is in thisworld," Mother Pencil pointed out as she hugged Little Pencil. "For me, there's no better feelingthan leaming to love yourself and realizing how important you are," she stressed.Little Pencil gave a sheepish smile, all he needed was his mother's enlightening words.Never had he been proud of what he was and who he was. At last, he was ready to introducehimself to the world."Lam a pen. I make drawings pop outl" proclaimed someone from the family of pens."I am a crayon. I make these drawings colorfull" declared someone from the family ofcrayons."I am a pencil. I make those drawings happenl" asserted Little Pencil, who came from thefamily of pencilsNever had he been this prouder! ​​ ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>CONSTELLATION<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>A <strong>constellation</strong> is a region on the divine circle where a gathering of noticeable stars frames an apparent framework or example, commonly addressing a creature, legendary individual or animal, or a lifeless thing.
</p><p>
</p><p>The beginnings of the most punctual <strong>constellations </strong>probably return to ancient times. Individuals utilized them to relate accounts of their convictions, encounters, creation, or folklore. Various societies and nations embraced their own <strong>constellations</strong>, some of which endured into the mid twentieth century before the present <strong>constellations </strong>were universally perceived. The acknowledgment of <strong>constellations</strong> has changed altogether after some time. Many changed in size or shape. Some became famous, just to drop into lack of definition. Some were restricted to a solitary culture or country.
</p><p>
</p><p>The 48 conventional Western constellations are Greek. They are given in Aratus' work Peculiarities and Ptolemy's Almagest, however their starting point presumably originates before these works by a few centuries. <strong>Constellations</strong> in the far southern sky were added from the fifteenth century until the mid-eighteenth century when European wayfarers started going toward the Southern Half of the globe. Twelve old <strong>constellations </strong>have a place with the zodiac. The beginnings of the zodiac remain generally dubious; its mysterious divisions became noticeable c. 400 BC in Babylonian or Chaldean cosmology.</p><p></p><p></p><p>What is a constellation? - Brainly.ph

                            28. Answer the following questions honestly. This can be used as a guide if you ever encounter a situation where you would need to provide counseling to another person 1. Building Rapport / Strengths Could you tell me some things about yourself? What do you enjoy doing? What are you good at? Describe what an awesome day would be like for you. What would the important people in your life say what is awesome about you? What do you enjoy learning about? 2. Goals How will you know that meeting here today was helpful? How would you know that coming here was worth your time? What do you hope to get out of visiting here today? What do you hope to see happen instead of what is bothering you? 3. Miracle Question If you could wave a magic wand and things changed, how would you know magic has happened? What would be different? What would you be doing differently that showed you your hopes came true? What else would be different? What other changes would you experience? Who would notice a change had happened? What would they see? 4. Exceptions to the Problem &amp; Competencies When are the times that "the problem is not such a problem? What is different? When does the problem" not bother you so much? How have you managed so far to deal with the problem" What has helped so far? Even if it has been just a little help. How have you found the courage to deal with this problem? 5. Scaling On a scale of 10 to 0, where 10 means your hope and goal has come true and O is the worst you can imagine, what number are you now? How will you know you have moved up one number? What will one number higher look like? How would you be able to move up one point? 6. Closure / Plan / What will you try differently or do more of when you leave today? What experiment can you try out? What is the best thing you noticed about yourself today?​</h2><br />

                            30. If i were to ask you a question, will you be able to answer those accurately?It's all about life; reborn, reincarnation, or somewhat a timetravelling. I just want to explore through your minds, i wanna know what are your thoughts to the question i will ask for you. In addition, I want to be fair so I'm going to add an additional points ^^ so here's the question:REBORN1. In your past life, you died once. You were given a chance to live again in order to correct all those misunderstanding that has happened in the past. What will you do now that you have learned all the things that has happened to you? Will you just let bygones be bygones? answer.REINCARNATION2. You reincarnated not only once but twice, the reincarnation that has happened to you twice in your life was really unfortunate. You didn't do a good deeds thus you did a bad one. What happened to you in your first reincarnation has also fated to be the same as the second reincarnation. Now that you're reincarnated for the third time, will you correct all your mistakes that you have done in your past life now that you've given a another chance? Will you still do the same?(oof it's actually tiring to type this long uwu &gt;•&lt;)Now here comes the interesting one *inserting a devil smile* :&gt;TIMETRAVELLING3. Comes to the weird and unfamilliar surroundings, old but elegant things are displayed. You suddenly realized that you're not in your house but you're in SOMEBODY'S house. Elegant house, beautiful views ANNDD you have actually mistaken into someone. That someone is whom highly respected and you knew from the start that you actually don't know where you are now. You ask some people around you what date is it now and suddenly you were shocked by its answer. Now that it slipped through your mind that you are in TimeTravel, what will you do in order to go back in modern/old times? Will you continue to live in those period as someone? 3 question in a rowww HAHA. the last question is a little bit complicated but who knows whether you understand the question or not:&gt;. I just hope you will answer this honestly, you don't need to prove to me that you're a genius or whatever, what i need is if someone out there may answer this correctly or honestly it means that person has a great comprehension. no need to pressure yourself, I also just want to express my thoughts by asking these questions:)goodluck! thank you for giving me your time^^​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. I'll try my very best to be a better person with all those knowledge. I would dare to change myself for the better, and use all those awareness as my guide.</p><p></p><p>2. I would live my life the way i wanted to. and won't really care if it'll change something or not. my third reincarnation may fail, but I'll sure make it worth it.</p><p></p><p>3. I would rather find my way back to time, and go back to my previous life. and if this thing i'm experiencing now is probably the future. i want to know how it happens.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>MOOH</p><br />
