                        It is a set of values of or the value system that a majority of the Filipinos have historically held important in their lives consisting their own unique assemblage of consistent ideologies, moral code, ethucal principles as I get in cultural and personal values that are promoted by society, for me yes because as the days gone by filipinos have been more corrupt and their values are getting low. So I think the we should change some of our values to make filipinos be a better citizen.<br />

You'd better plan and decide carefully to where you're going to allocate your funds so it won't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>(2) Every drop of perspiration of an industrious man will be rewarded accordingly.- This proverb means that in every hardship from a person who is full of determination and perseverance there will be a reward that he'll get out of it.

                            7. Account briefly the following. (limit your answers to 5 sentences only and each sentence should only have 10 words) 1.A house is not a home, what then be the role of values in making into a home? 2.How does Technological Advancement affects the values system in our society today? 3.If a child will not learn the way we teach we should teach them the way they learn. Elaborate the statements. 4.How does values developed and what influences its development? 5.Why Philippine Value system degrades as time passed by?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>1. Values play a significant role in making a house into a home. They provide a sense of identity and belonging for the people who live there. A house that is infused with positive values creates a positive and nurturing environment for its inhabitants. On the other hand, a house that lacks values or has negative values can create a negative and toxic atmosphere. To make a house into a home, it is important to identify and cultivate values that align with one's personal beliefs and goals. These values should be reflected in the daily habits and routines of the people living in the home, as well as in the overall atmosphere and decor of the space.</p><p></p><p>2. Technology can change the way we communicate and interact with each other. It can also alter the way we access and share information. Some people may value convenience and efficiency over privacy.</p><p>Others may place a higher value on traditional ways of living. The impact of technology on values varies among individuals and societies.</p><p></p><p>3. Different children learn in different ways. Some may be visual learners, while others may be auditory learners. It is important to identify a child's learning style and tailor teaching methods accordingly. This can increase the child's engagement and understanding of the material. Failing to adapt to a child's learning style may result in frustration and decreased motivation.</p><p></p><p>4. Values can be influenced by family, culture, and life experiences. Early childhood experiences and role models can shape a person's values. Social interactions and group membership can also influence values. Personal goals and beliefs can also play a role in the development of values.</p><p>As a person grows and experiences new things, their values may change and evolve.</p><p></p><p>5. The Philippine Value system has degraded over time because of the increased influence of Western culture, the rise of materialism, the weakening of family relations, the rise of individualism, and the erosion of traditional values and beliefs. The traditional values that were once passed down from generation to generation have been replaced by the modern values of consumerism, materialism, and selfishness. The newer generation has embraced the values of instant gratification, convenience, and pleasure-seeking, which has caused them to neglect the importance of community, family and faith. Additionally, the lack of proper education and guidance for young people has also been a factor in the degradation of the Philippine Value system. Finally, the increasing influence of the media and social media has caused many to lose touch with their Filipino identity, which has further weakened the traditional values and beliefs of the country.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I am unable to find any recent research on Department of Education (DepEd) orders on value education and value integration that specifically address the claim that the Philippine educational system is more form than substance as claimed in Senator Shahani's report. However, the DepEd has issued several orders and guidelines that aim to integrate values education in the curriculum and instruction in schools.</p><p></p><p>For example, DepEd Order No. 8, series of 2015, titled "Institutionalization of Values Education in the K to 12 Basic Education Curriculum," aims to integrate values education across all subjects in the K-12 curriculum. The order specifies that values education should be integrated in all subjects, and that teachers should use various teaching strategies such as role-playing, group discussions, and reflective thinking exercises to help students internalize the values being taught.</p><p></p><p>DepEd Order No. 54, series of 2016, titled "Revised Basic Education Curriculum for the K-12 Program," also aims to integrate values education in the curriculum by including topics on values education and citizenship education in several subjects such as Mother Tongue, English, and Filipino.</p><p></p><p>DepEd Order No. 15, series of 2018, titled "Adoption of the National Qualifications Framework for the K to 12 Basic Education Program" also includes the development of values, attitudes, and skills as part of the student's learning outcomes.</p><p></p><p>These DepEd orders and guidelines can be seen as evidence of the Department's efforts to integrate values education in the curriculum and instruction, and may suggest that the Philippine educational system is not only focused on form rather than substance.</p><p></p><p>It's important to note that these DepEd orders and guidelines are just a part of the educational system, and the actual implementation of these policies in the schools could be different and it also depend on the teacher's teaching style.</p><br />

                            25. Describe the practice of merit system and the so called spoils system in the Philippine Government. Explain how it affects the operations of government offices and the perception of people towards these effects. Identify Filipino values that are rooted in these practices.​</h2><br />
                        <p>The merit system is when public officials are chosen and promoted based on their qualifications and performance. It can improve the quality of public service, but it can also face challenges like corruption. The spoils system is when public officials are rewarded and removed based on political loyalty. It can increase political support but also lead to inefficiency and abuse of power. Some Filipino values that can affect public officials’ behavior under both systems are utang na loob (debt of gratitude), pakikisama (getting along), and bahala na (come what may).</p><p></p><br />

Because individuals, especially among those from less-traditional nations, are now given more freedom to honor their choices, abortion, and divorce have now become part of some cultures. Guide Questions: In your opinion, are these two phenomena acceptable based on your personal value system? Is this part of our society’s norms? Is divorce or abortion considering a taboo in the Philippines? Are you in favor that these two become legal in Philippines?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>for me its undecided because if Philippines have divorce theres no more women and men will be in prison in a relationship that is not healthy anymore.it was OK to be got divorce that to cheat  and find happiness to someone while they are still married.aside from that if Philippines have abortion there's no innocent baby will be abandon in a cold place and died or left behind anywhere but the two of these have their own negative side in terms of religion and humanity.if Philippines have divorce the sacred ceremony like this will be useless and if the philippines have abortion what will happen to those fetus that didn't any single chance to see the world but  let's think,if you can't carry or support your pregnancy and the baby why you let it happen,why many women,girls think of the consequences of their action but let's not generalize because we can't blame those rape victim if they want to get rid of the fruit of cruelness.whether the philippines government and religion sector approve or declined it we can't do anything about it.we just need to support their decisions whether its taboo or not don't be bias and always look both angle or story before we judge.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Filipino value system or Filipino values refers to the set of values that a majority of the Filipino have historically held important in their lives. This Philippine values system includes their own unique assemblage of consistent ideologies, moral codes, ethical practices, etiquette and cultural and personal values that are promoted by their society. As with any society though, the values that an individual holds sacred can differ on the basis of religion, upbringing and other factors.</p><p></p><p>As a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity) and commercial relationships.[1]</p><br />
