                            11. Directions: Before writing your self-composed speech for your Performance Task , you must first create a topic outline. This way you can easily arrange all the necessary subtopics and the supporting details of your speech. First, decide which main topic you intend to deliver based from the previous activity. Write the topic inside the template and fill in the blanks with the list of things you may say about your chosen topic or the subtopics. (10 points) brainliest tamang sagot​</h2><br />
                        <p>Most speakers and audience members would agree that an organized speech is both easier to present as well as more persuasive. Public speaking teachers especially believe in the power of organizing your speech, which is why they encourage (and often require) that you create an outline for your speech. Outlines, or textual arrangements of all the various elements of a speech, are a very common way of organizing a speech before it is delivered. Most extemporaneous speakers keep their outlines with them during the speech as a way to ensure that they do not leave out any important elements and to keep them on track. Writing an outline is also important to the speechwriting process since doing so forces the speakers to think about the main points and sub-points, the examples they wish to include, and the ways in which these elements correspond to one another. In short, the outline functions both as an organization tool and as a reference for delivering a speech.</p><br />
