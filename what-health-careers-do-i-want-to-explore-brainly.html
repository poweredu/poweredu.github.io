                        <p>Why a Career in Health?
</p><p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics expects health care to be the fastest growing employment industry between 2014 and 2024. This projection is good news for you as it means increased job security as more and more fulfilling, lucrative positions are being created for people driven to make a difference in their communities.
</p><p>
</p><p>ExploreHealthCareers.org strives to highlight the opportunities health careers offer and serve as your expert resource as you navigate your career path. With content authored by those already working in the field themselves, we’ll connect you to the knowledge you need to choose the right health career and apply and pay for school.
</p><p>
</p><p>Together, we can make caring your career.
</p><p>
</p><p>10 Reasons to Pursue a Health Career
</p><p>A career is more than a paycheck. It’s something you’ll be doing 40 hours a week for 40 years or more. That’s why you should carefully consider the reasons you are choosing your career. And while a good salary and interesting work are at the top of the list, there are even more reasons to consider a health care career.
</p><p>
</p><p>You’ll enjoy job security:
</p><p>Unlike many industries that are losing workers, the health care field is growing rapidly. The U.S. Department of Labor expects health care will generate 3 million new wage and salary jobs between 2006 and 2016, more than any other industry.  Dozens of health careers have good or excellent job prospects, meaning you’ll never have trouble finding a job.
</p><p>
</p><p>You will do work that interests you:
</p><p>A career in health can lead in many directions. You can treat patients in an office or study cells under a microscope. You can work in a small doctor’s office or run a hospital. You can examine eyes, mend bones, clean teeth or deliver babies. The range of skills and experiences is limited only to your imagination.
</p><p>
</p><p>You can live and work anywhere you want:
</p><p>Almost every region of the United States has a strong demand for health care professionals in a wide range of fields. As a trained health worker, you can choose where you want to live and the setting you want to work in.
</p><p>
</p><p>You can find a health career that fits your educational plans:
</p><p>There are health careers that require eight, 10, even 13 years of specialized education after high school, and there are health careers you can train for in 18 to 24 months at your local community college. Search for health careers that fit your educational plans.
</p><p>
</p><p>You can learn by reading and doing:
</p><p>Many health career training programs involve both classroom lectures and hands-on learning opportunities. You may spend time in a lab, do a summer internship in a community clinic or do a clinical rotation in a bustling hospital to hone your technical and patient care skills. There are even hands-on learning programs for high school and college students who haven’t decided on a career.
</p><p>
</p><p>You can get help to pay for school:
</p><p>Hundreds of scholarships, financial aid programs, grants and student loans are available to help aspiring health care workers pay for school.
</p><p>
</p><p>You’ll have a clear path to advancement:
</p><p>It costs employers less to promote a trusted worker than to hire someone new. Many employers will reimburse educational expenses and even give you time off to go to school so you can qualify for a higher-paying position.
</p><p>
</p><p>You’ll earn a good salary:
</p><p>Health care workers make good money. The average entry-level health worker earns from $15 to $50 per hour. The more experience and training you get in your field, the more money you can make.
</p><p>
</p><p>You can work with people (or not):
</p><p>Do you prefer to work alone or on a team?  Are you more comfortable working with people or with information? Whatever your preference, you can find a health career that matches your skills and interests.
</p><p>
</p><p>You’ll make a difference in people’s lives
</p><p>Perhaps the biggest benefit of being a health care professional is that you will make a difference in people’s lives.  Whether you work as a nurse’s aide, an acupuncturist, a health services administrator or a veterinarian, to name just a few careers, you will be helping to make our world a little healthier, a little safer and a little better.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>1. Pursuing a health career is important because it allows you to make a positive impact on people's lives by helping them maintain or improve their health. This can be a very fulfilling career as you can work with patients to help them manage their illnesses, prevent diseases, and promote healthy lifestyles. Additionally, health careers are in high demand and offer job security, competitive salaries, and opportunities for advancement.</p><p></p><p>2. When considering your skills and interests, think about what you enjoy doing and what you are good at. For example, if you enjoy working with people, have strong communication skills, and are compassionate, you may be well-suited for a career in nursing. If you have a strong interest in science and enjoy problem-solving, a career in medicine or research may be a good fit.</p><p></p><p>3. There are many different health careers to explore, depending on your interests and skills. Some popular health careers include nursing, medicine, dentistry, physical therapy, occupational therapy, pharmacy, public health, and medical research.</p><p></p><p>4.

Consider job shadowing or volunteering at a hospital or clinic to gain firsthand experience and insight into the different careers. You can also attend career fairs or informational sessions to learn more about the various health professions.</p><p></p><p>5. Based on your skills and interests, you may be drawn to a particular health career. For example, if you have a passion for helping others and are skilled at problem-solving, a career in medicine may be a good fit. Alternatively, if you enjoy working with your hands and have an interest in healthcare, a career in dental hygiene may be a better match.</p><p></p><p>6. When choosing a health career, there are several factors to consider, such as education and training requirements, job outlook, salary, and work-life balance. It's important to weigh these factors against your own personal goals and priorities to determine which career path is right for you.</p><p></p><p>7. To meet your career goals, you may need to take specific steps such as obtaining a relevant degree or certification, completing internships or clinical rotations, or networking with professionals in the field.

                        <p>If you want to explore what career you would want to pursue, you have to <strong>identify your interests</strong> first.  By taking up personality tests and interest tests, you will have a more accurate of your strengths and interests.  The results will not identify which careers you should take, but they will guide you on choosing the relevant career options for you.
</p><p></p><p>Second, you have to be mindful and definite in <strong>choosing among your options</strong>.  This can be a tough decision because it will either make or break your career path.  Although you can always make a fresh start, you would not want taking too much time having a trial and error in your career set up.
</p><p></p><p>And third, <strong>seek advice</strong> from your parents or significant people if needed.  They should not make the decision, but their role is to give you a different perspective of things which may help you weigh the pros and cons first before jumping into a concrete decisions.
