Tupas (2002) cited, Krasshan with Tarrel to say, that language acquisition occurs in only one way by understanding messages. We acquire language when we understand what we hear and understand, not what we say. The goal of language, classes according to this view is to supply comprehensive input, which is the crucial ingredient acquisition, and to bring the student to the point where he or she could understand the language outside the classroom. When this happened, the acquirer can utilize the real world, as well as the classroom for progress. 2. What are the reading miscues committed by the students? 3. According to De Joya (2005), it was clear that they endeavored on formulating strategies to help pupils who are non-readers and low performers in class. It was in this document that the value of human dignity is emphasized for it is believed so in "Every Pupil, A Good Reader". Its core strategy was to obtain the level of oral reading skills with comprehension of the pupils through the concrete effort of school administrators and teachers. 4.

Language Amotivation and Approaches to Learning English among Filipino College Freshmen 24 FU 2 06 Dr. Rochelle Irene Lucas Dr. Mildred Rojo-Laurilla Department of English and Applied Linguistics "The present study explores Filipino college freshmen students' approaches to learning in relation to amotivation (possible lack of motivation in learning English as a second language) and related experiences in using English outside the language classroom. Adapting Biggs (2001) and Legault et al's (2006) to evaluate the leaming approaches of the students in studying the target language, the researchers surveyed 224 students from different colleges in the university taking the first General Education English course (English ane). The results of the study indicate that university freshmen students are neither predominant on either cleep approach nor surface approaches to learning. They use both strategies to almost the same extent. In terms of dimensions of amotivation, the results indicated that freshmen students did not exhibit much of the indicators of amotivation implying that they still show interest and are motivated to learn English as a second language. The cohesiveness of their responses to questions on amotivation also indicated that they have more or less the same perceptions of the value of the task, task characteristics, and their beliefs about their abilities and efforts in learning English Source: Sttps://www.disu.edu presearch abstracts Answers Questions 1.

                                            Can you help me find the main idea?
The roles of English within and between the many of the countries which make up Southeast Asia are increasing, and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non‐standard forms in these new varieties of English. Given the recent research reviewed in this paper, the criteria by which the use of non‐standard forms are classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised. The paper will conclude by considering whether the role of English as a lingua franca in the region has reached its zenith and whether regional language education policy is likely allow the languages of Asia to thrive.

                            1. reflection of research in time skills in language and education​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>All teachers and learners bring with them a
</p><p>philosophy of what teaching and learning is.
</p><p>This philosophy is more likely to be implicitly
</p><p>rather than explicitly held, especially by lear-
</p><p>ners, and so taken for granted. Such philoso-
</p><p>phies are formed by our own experiences of
</p><p>education and learning from the earliest days
</p><p>of childhood onwards. We all accept as being
</p><p>the norm those educational experiences which
</p><p>are part of our socio-cultural context. Only
</p><p>when we are able to experience other approa-
</p><p>ches, are we able to question and evaluate our
</p><p>own.
</p><p>Pedagogic principles and practice are instilled
</p><p>in trainee teachers and they carry these into
</p><p>the classroom with them. Very rarely are the
</p><p>roles of teachers and learners examined and
</p><p>questioned. In spite of efforts to encourage
</p><p>learner development, learner independence
</p><p>and even autonomous learning, most class-
</p><p>room situations are still teacher-centred. This
</p><p>is not a criticism, simply a reporting of reality
</p><p>from several observational studies. It’s not
</p><p>surprising. Traditional approaches provide
</p><p>security for all concerned. However, the richest
</p><p>learning environment will be created by
</p><p>teachers with the range of knowledge and
</p><p>skills to vary their approach to suit individuals
</p><p>and specific groups and contexts.
</p><p>It is also difficult to measure language lear-
</p><p>ning qualitatively. Language is not a body of
</p><p>knowledge, a set of facts, which can be me-
</p><p>morised and regurgitated for the purposes of tests
</p><p>and examinations. It is an innate human ability
</p><p>and as such organic. It grows and develops in
</p><p>favourable environments, shrivels with neglect
</p><p>and is affected by emotional factors. There are
</p><p>various levels of competencies which can be
</p><p>measured but each performance of language
</p><p>will be different from the next. Spoken com-
</p><p>petence is the most immediate but also the
</p><p>most fragile and volatile. We all know how arti-
</p><p>culate, erudite and focussed we can be when
</p><p>sitting in a relaxed group of friends and putting
</p><p>the world to rights. But can we do the same
</p><p>in front of an audience? Or at a job interview?
</p><p>Or in the courtroom? Or when we’re tired,
</p><p>unwell, in or out of love? Every human factor
</p><p>affects our ability to use even our mother
</p><p>tongue competently and all these factors are
</p><p>carried over into second language contexts.</p><br />

                            3. 42. How will the study help improve the quality of Science instruction in the country and advance the research concerns of Language Education?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:Why is science education important in our schools? We are surrounded by technology and the products of science every day. Public policy decisions that affect every aspect of our lives are based in scientific evidence. And, of course, the immensely complex natural world that surrounds us illustrates infinite scientific concepts. As children grow up in an increasingly technologically and scientifically advanced world, they need to be scientifically literate to succeed.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Ideally, teaching the scientific method to students is teaching them how to think, learn, solve problems and make informed decisions. These skills are integral to every aspect of a student’s education and life, from school to career. With a graduate degree in science education such as the online Master of Education in Curriculum and Instruction in Science Education from the University of Texas at Arlington, teachers can use what they learn about science instruction techniques and curriculum design to advance science education and student learning as a whole.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>How Is Science Involved in Students’ Everyday Lives?
</strong></p><p><strong>Science is everywhere. A student rides to school on a bus, and in that instance alone, there are many examples of technology based on the scientific method. The school bus is a product of many areas of science and technology, including mechanical engineering and innovation. The systems of roads, lights, sidewalks and other infrastructure are carefully designed by civil engineers and planners. The smartphone in the student’s hand is a miracle of modern computer engineering.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Outside the window, trees turn sunlight into stored energy and create the oxygen we need to survive. Whether “natural” or human-derived, every aspect of a student’s life is filled with science — from their own internal biology to the flat-screen TV in the living room.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Scientific Inquiry and Scientific Method
</strong></p><p><strong>Perhaps even more important than specific examples of science in our lives are the ways we use scientific thought, method and inquiry to come to our decisions. This is not necessarily a conscious thing. The human need to solve problems can arise from curiosity or from necessity. The process of inquiry is how we find answers and substantiate those answers.

Tupas (2002) cited, Krasshan with Tarrel to say, that language acquisition occurs in only one way by understanding messages. We acquire language when we understand what we hear and understand, not what we say. The goal of language, classes according to this view is to supply comprehensive input, which is the crucial ingredient acquisition, and to bring the student to the point where he or she could understand the language outside the classroom. When this happened, the acquirer can utilize the real world, as well as the classroom for progress. 2. What are the reading miscues committed by the students? 3. According to De Joya (2005), it was clear that they endeavored on formulating strategies to help pupils who are non-readers and low performers in class.

Its core strategy was to obtain the level of oral reading skills with comprehension of the pupils through the concrete effort of school administrators and teachers. 4.

Adapting Biggs (2001) and Legault et al's (2006) to evaluate the leaming approaches of the students in studying the target language, the researchers surveyed 224 students from different colleges in the university taking the first General Education English course (English ane). The results of the study indicate that university freshmen students are neither predominant on either cleep approach nor surface approaches to learning. They use both strategies to almost the same extent. In terms of dimensions of amotivation, the results indicated that freshmen students did not exhibit much of the indicators of amotivation implying that they still show interest and are motivated to learn English as a second language. The cohesiveness of their responses to questions on amotivation also indicated that they have more or less the same perceptions of the value of the task, task characteristics, and their beliefs about their abilities and efforts in learning English Source: Sttps://www.disu.edu presearch abstracts Answers Questions 1.

                            24. Can you help me find the main idea?
The roles of English within and between the many of the countries which make up Southeast Asia are increasing, and English is constantly being used and negotiated as a mutual means of communication by Asian multilinguals for whom English is an additional language. It is timely, therefore, to consider ways in which these Englishes have been developing, along with the roles English is currently playing. Areas worthy of investigation include the influence of language contact and the motivations for the presence of non‐standard forms in these new varieties of English. Given the recent research reviewed in this paper, the criteria by which the use of non‐standard forms are classified as characteristic of the particular variety need to be revised. The paper will conclude by considering whether the role of English as a lingua franca in the region has reached its zenith and whether regional language education policy is likely allow the languages of Asia to thrive.
