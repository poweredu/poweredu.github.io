                                            Baguio Shares Covid-19 Best Practices to Other LGUs The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), through its Local Government Academy (LGA), continues to maximize the use of online platforms as one of the ways in addressing or fighting the 2019 coronavírus disease (Covid-19). The DILG produces a series of video teleconference called LISTONG UGNAYAN with the following objectives raising public awareness about the pandemic, equipping its stakeholders and local counterparts with the right knowledge, capacitating local government units (LGUs) to better understand their roles and responsibilities, and sharing of best practices. The 9th Online Talakayan Series on April 22, 2020 revolved around the topic about pioneering ways to fight Covid-19 particularly on the contact tracing and detection experiences in the City of Baguio. As the Resource Person, Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong explained the basic principles they applied and continue to apply in addressing this crisis seamless collaboration between law enforcement, investigators, and health authorities; mass testing is critical to contact tracing; cognitive interviewing skill is the key to efficient collection of information; and of technology (as analytical tools) is indispensable, use Mayor Magalong underscored the importance of technology and the organization of contact tracing team (CTT), acknowledging that these play vital roles during the detection phase. He said that to create harmonized initiatives, the 4Cs must be observed which stands for collaboration, coordination, cooperation, and communication. "Every second counts. Early detection is key to prevention," added Mayor Magalong, When asked for some tips on how to effectively contain the virus, Mayor Magalong advised his fellow local chief executives to be passionate enough in taking the lead, to get themselves involved, and to think of some innovative or out-of-the-box solutions to address this unusual problem. Mayor Magalong ended his talk by encouraging his fellow LCEs to reflect on the present situation we are facing “Let us work as one so that we will be able to heal as one,” he concluded.Ipaliwanag ang papel na ginagampanan ng inyong komunidad para sakahandaan, katatagan sa mga darating na sakuna upang maisulong o matiyak angkaligtasan ng mamamayan sa komunidad.

The crew landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility a day before the actual walk.

The Triassic Period lasted for 35 million years from 250-205 million years ago. Planet Earth was a very different place back then. All the continents were united to form one huge land mass known as Pangaea. The Jurassic Period was the second phase. The continents began shifting apart. The time scale for this famous period is from 205 to 138 million years ago. The Cretaceous Period was the last period of the dinosaurs. It spanned a time from 138 million to about 65 million years ago. In this period the continents fully separated. However, Australia and Antarctica were still united. What type of text is this? *a.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic is testing our society. In recent months, the Swedish government has presented a range of different measures. The government’s overarching goal is to safeguard people’s lives and health and to secure the health care capacity.</p><p></p><p>“This crisis will continue for a long time. It will be tough. But our society is strong. If everyone takes their responsibility, together we will overcome it,” says Prime Minister Stefan Löfven.</p><p></p><p>On 1 February, the Government classified COVID-19 as a disease that constitutes a danger to society, opening the possibility of extraordinary communicable disease control measures.</p><p></p><p>The overall objective of the Government’s efforts is to reduce the pace of the COVID-19 virus’s spread: to ‘flatten the curve’ so that large numbers of people do not become ill at the same time. </p><p></p><p>It is important to implement the right measure at the right time, to achieve the best possible impact. The Government will take every decision necessary to safeguard people’s lives, health and jobs.</p><p></p><p>The measures taken by the Government and government agencies to reduce the pace of the virus’s spread need to be weighed against their effects on society and public health in general. The measures taken are reviewed constantly as the situation develops.</p><p></p><p>An important starting point is careful consideration of the expert knowledge contributed by government agencies. These expert agencies can make recommendations to the Government on the measures they consider should be taken, but they can also take decisions of their own.</p><p></p><p>“Our government agencies and our health care system are doing everything they can. But every person in Sweden needs to take individual responsibility. If everyone takes responsibility, we can keep the spread of the virus in check. Follow the authorities’ advice: if you have even the slightest symptoms, do not go to work and refrain from meeting other people,” says Mr Löfven.</p><p></p><p>People in Sweden have a high level of trust in government agencies. This means that a large proportion of people follow government agencies’ advice. In the current situation, people in Sweden are on the whole acting responsibly to reduce the spread of infection by, for example, restricting their social contacts.</p><p></p><p>This crisis may continue for a long time, and in order for the measures to work over time, people need to understand and accept them.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>:))</p><p></p><br />

                            6. Baguio Shares Covid-19 Best Practices to Other LGUs The Department of the Interior and Local Government (DILG), through its Local Government Academy (LGA), continues to maximize the use of online platforms as one of the ways in addressing or fighting the 2019 coronavírus disease (Covid-19). The DILG produces a series of video teleconference called LISTONG UGNAYAN with the following objectives raising public awareness about the pandemic, equipping its stakeholders and local counterparts with the right knowledge, capacitating local government units (LGUs) to better understand their roles and responsibilities, and sharing of best practices. The 9th Online Talakayan Series on April 22, 2020 revolved around the topic about pioneering ways to fight Covid-19 particularly on the contact tracing and detection experiences in the City of Baguio. As the Resource Person, Baguio City Mayor Benjamin Magalong explained the basic principles they applied and continue to apply in addressing this crisis seamless collaboration between law enforcement, investigators, and health authorities; mass testing is critical to contact tracing; cognitive interviewing skill is the key to efficient collection of information; and of technology (as analytical tools) is indispensable, use Mayor Magalong underscored the importance of technology and the organization of contact tracing team (CTT), acknowledging that these play vital roles during the detection phase. He said that to create harmonized initiatives, the 4Cs must be observed which stands for collaboration, coordination, cooperation, and communication. "Every second counts. Early detection is key to prevention," added Mayor Magalong, When asked for some tips on how to effectively contain the virus, Mayor Magalong advised his fellow local chief executives to be passionate enough in taking the lead, to get themselves involved, and to think of some innovative or out-of-the-box solutions to address this unusual problem. Mayor Magalong ended his talk by encouraging his fellow LCEs to reflect on the present situation we are facing “Let us work as one so that we will be able to heal as one,” he concluded.Ipaliwanag ang papel na ginagampanan ng inyong komunidad para sakahandaan, katatagan sa mga darating na sakuna upang maisulong o matiyak angkaligtasan ng mamamayan sa komunidad.
