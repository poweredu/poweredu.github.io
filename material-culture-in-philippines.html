                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Filipino national costume is rather colorful, ornate, and beautiful. Filipino people lived under the occupation of other countries for centuries. That's why their national attire was formed under the influence of different cultures and got some of their features. The US, Spain, and Japan had the biggest impact on the traditional clothing of the Philippines. But nevertheless, Filipino folk dress is very unique, authentic, and even tribal, if we can say so.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Tinikling,  “Tinikling” is a dance of the Christian population in Leyte province, the home province of Mrs. Imelda Marcos, wife of the President of the Philippines, “Singkil” or “ankle bracelet” concerns a Moslem princess in the south. “The story is taken from an epic, about a prince with a roving eye,”.</p><p></p>CARIÑOSA:<p>The dance originated in Panay Island in the Visayan Islands and was introduced by the Spaniards during their colonization of the Philippines. It is related to some of the Spanish dances like the bolero and the Mexican dance Jarabe Tapatio or the Mexican Hat Dance.</p><p></p>TINIKLING:<p>The dance imitates the movement of the tikling birds as they dodge bamboo traps set by rice farmers. Dancers mimic the tikling bird's grace and agility by dancing between large bamboo poles. The Tinikling is one of the oldest dances from the Philippines, and originated in the islands of Leyte in the Visayas</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Clash of Cultures: Two Worlds Collide</p><p>Central and South American Empires</p><p>11e. Clash of Cultures: Two Worlds Collide</p><p>Montezuma was the unluckiest of kings. History elected him to oversee the ruin of the last great Central American empire. Other Aztec rulers had encountered setbacks in their conquests. For Montezuma it was different. He confronted an alien empire from across the sea. In its leader, the Spaniard Hernan Cortez, he faced an opponent as astute and skillful as himself. In the end, Cortez proved the more determined of the two.</p><p></p><p>In the wake of Columbus' historic voyage in 1492, expeditions, especially from Imperial Spain, swarmed into Aztec territory. They came in search of gold and souls — gold to enrich the coffers </p><p></p><p>Cannons vs. Clubs</p><p>The Spanish army was the most ruthless fighting force on earth. It had not suffered a single defeat for 150 years. The Spaniards possessed cannon and arquebus (primitive muskets) which terrified the American tribes..</p><p></p><p>Wars were religious rituals to the Aztecs. A prime objective was the capture of prisoners for sacrifice. During the siege of Tenochtitlan, conquistadors watched from a distance. They were horrified as Aztecs dragged captives up the steps of the Great Temple and ripped out their hearts. The Spanish viewed the Aztecs as savages.</p><p></p><p>Aztec warriors had several opportunities to kill Cortez. Each time they tried to capture him alive — and each time he escaped. Spaniards killed Aztec leaders whenever they could. Prominent in their brightly feathered costumes, they often led the warrior ranks. With their deaths, ordinary soldiers became demoralized and fled.</p><p></p><p>Atahualpa</p><p>Atahuallpa was the last Inca king. He was captured by Francisco Pizarro, who received tons of gold and silver for Atahuallpa's safe release. After converting to Christianity in order to prevent being burned alive, Atahuallpa was strangled to death and then burned by Pizarro's men.</p><p>Dissention and Disease</p><p>The Aztec Empire was a loose confederation of allies and subject states. Many deeply resented Aztec rule, their dreaded tax collectors, and the massive tributes they paid. In the Spanish, they saw their saviors. Cortez exploited this unrest with great skill. In his final assault on Tenochtitlan, his band of 900 Spanish soldiers was joined by perhaps 150,000 natives.</p><p></p><p>The Europeans brought with them diseases such as measles and smallpox against which the American tribes had no natural immunity. They spread like wildfire, killing rulers of both the Aztecs and Incas, along with millions of other people.</p><p>Self-Fulfilling Prophecy</p><p>Long before Cortez landed at Vera Cruz on Good Friday, 1519, portents of doom appeared. A comet "bright as to turn night into day" lit the sky. Dismayed soothsayers and astrologers maintained they did not see it. For this unhelpful approach, Montezuma cast them into cages where they starved to death. Then, an important temple burned. Lastly, hunters brought Montezuma a bird with a mirror strapped to its head. In it he saw large numbers of people "advance as for war; they appeared to be half men half deer."</p><p></p><p>How much of this is fact? How much is myth? By the time spies brought tales of mountains floating upon the sea (Spanish galleons), and men with "flesh very white...a long beard and hair to their ears," Montezuma's nerves were shattered. Was this the legendary feathered serpent god, Quetzalcotl, who having vanished into the eastern ocean, now returned?</p><p></p><p>Montezuma half-convinced himself Cortez was a god.</p><p></p><p>Hernando Cortés</p><p>Hernando Cortés and conquistadors like him looted the land of the Aztecs. Cortés brought home gold, silver, and jewels from the New World which inspired settlement in the Americas.</p><p>He sent Cortez the feathery costume of Quetzalcotl with other gifts, including "twenty ducks made of gold, very natural looking." Cortez took the bold move of marching on Tenochtitlan. With a force of 500 Spanish soldiers and whatever warriors he recruited along the way, he faced Montezuma on the city's southern causeway on November 8, 1519. Montezuma invited him in.</p><p></p><p>historic documents, declaration, constitution, more</p><p>The Ancient Civilizations Crumble</p><p>Was this a political blunder or a shrewd tactical move? Once inside the city, Cortez found himself isolated, at the mercy of the Aztec Empire. He quickly rectified matters. In another bold stroke, he kidnapped Montezuma. With 30 seasoned soldiers, he entered the royal palace and gave the Emperor a stark choice — come with us, or die. Montezuma, fearful, puzzled, dejected, disorientated by these men-gods, submitted.</p><p></p><p>Months later, while trying to calm a rebellion against the interlopers, Montezuma was killed in a firestorm of rocks and javelins. Cortez and his crew barely escaped with their lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
