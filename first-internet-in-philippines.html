                                            The study was done in two phases. In the first phase, interviews were conducted to identify how the Internet is used as well as perceptions of healthy versus problematic Internet use. In the second phase, surveys were administered to 387 respondents from all over the Philippines. Results revealed that purposes or activities using the Internet can be grouped into seven factors, namely basic Internet use, entertainment, expression and interaction, e-commerce, school-related, and technological deviance. Positive outcomes of Internet use are greater productivity and personal enhancement. Negative outcomes can be described in terms of social harm and Internet addiction. Results link specific usage with outcomes. The use of Internet to express oneself and interact predicted both personal enhancement and problematic Internet use. Basic Internet use and entertainment predicted problematic Internet use.

                                            .In line with the Pandemic brought by COVID-19, Filipinos embraced the digital world as they stayed at home. There was significant increase on videoconferencing and on-line meeting via Skype, Zoom or Lark. Movie subscription via Netflix grew enormously with an additional of 15.8 million new subscribers during the first three months of 2020. In addition, the demand for data communications grew exponentially and internet traffic have recorded more than 40% during the Luzon-wide quarantine. With this, there was a new term coined referred to as “digital normal” where people will permanently be glued to live, work and play in the digital world. With the advent of the digital normal, organization and companies need to make a paradigm shift on their business models, processes and competencies to take advantage of the digital transformation.

                            18. The study was done in two phases. In the first phase, interviews were conducted to identify how the Internet is used as well as perceptions of healthy versus problematic Internet use. In the second phase, surveys were administered to 387 respondents from all over the Philippines. Results revealed that purposes or activities using the Internet can be grouped into seven factors, namely basic Internet use, entertainment, expression and interaction, e-commerce, school-related, and technological deviance. Positive outcomes of Internet use are greater productivity and personal enhancement. Negative outcomes can be described in terms of social harm and Internet addiction. Results link specific usage with outcomes. The use of Internet to express oneself and interact predicted both personal enhancement and problematic Internet use. Basic Internet use and entertainment predicted problematic Internet use.
