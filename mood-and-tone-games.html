                        <p>The Game: A One-Act Play by Louise Bryant (1915)</p><p></p><p>Allegory: "The Game" is not an allegorical work. It is a straightforward play that presents a realistic situation and characters without using symbols or metaphors to convey deeper meanings.</p><p></p><p>Tone: The tone of "The Game" is critical and confrontational. The play challenges the patriarchal values and power dynamics that oppress women, and its tone is one of anger and frustration at the injustices that women face.</p><p></p><p>Mood: The mood of "The Game" is tense and uncomfortable. The atmosphere of the play is charged with the simmering resentment and anger of Martha, who is frustrated by the unfairness of the game and the dismissive attitudes of the men around her.</p><p></p><p>Theme: The main theme of "The Game" is the oppression of women by patriarchal society. The play exposes the power dynamics that privilege men over women and restrict women's agency and autonomy. It argues for the importance of women's voices and the need for gender equality in all spheres of life</p><br />
