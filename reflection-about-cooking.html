please help i need answer now</h2><br />
                        <p>summarize munalang . </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>In this reflection I will learn about a few types of cooking method and the arts of seasoning and flavoring. There are two major types of cooking method which is Moist Heat Method and Dry Heat Method. Moist Heat Method refers to a technique that involve of liquid in cooking food. This technique depends on whether it is steam, water, stock, wine or some other liquid. The temperature for this kind of method is much lower in between of 60°C to 100°C. There are several types of cooking method that have been listed under Moist Heat Method which are poaching, simmering, boiling, steaming, braising, and stewing.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Dry Heat Method refers to any kind of cooking technique where the heat is transferred to the food without using any moisture. This technique usually involves high temperature of 150°C or hotter than that. Roasting, baking, grilling, broiling, pan-frying, sauteing, and deep-frying are example of Dry Heat Method. Furthermore, there are a few kind of cooking technique that involves Moist Heat and Dry Heat Method. This kind of technique may begin with Moist heat Method and followed by Dry Heat Method. For example braising and stewing. These two techniques involve the combination of both cooking method.</p><p></p><p>For the second question, I will learn about the arts of seasoning and flavoring. Seasoning can enhance the natural taste of most foods without changing the original flavor. Salt is the main seasoning agent in the culinary arts. Herbs and spices also include in seasoning. In the meantime, flavoring is added to the food to modify the original flavor of the food. Flavoring is a substance that we used in altering the food causing it to give a sweet, sour, or tangy taste. CONCLUSION What I have learned from this assignment is there are a few types of cooking method. For example like Moist Heat Method.</p><p></p><p>In this kind of technique I have learned a few basic cooking skills which are poaching, simmering, boiling, steaming, braising, and stewing. The technique that has been used in this kind of cooking method is mostly the same. From what I know, Moist Heat Method will involve liquid either water, stock or other kinds of liquid. Meanwhile for Dry Heat Method, I have learned that this kind of cooking method is no moisture was involved in cooking process. We also used high temperature in this method. A few basic cooking skills that used Dry Heat Method are roasting, baking, grilling, broiling, pan-frying, sauteing, and deep-frying.</p><p></p><p>And most of the cooking methods have a similar process. Moreover, I have learned that there are few technique of cooking process that involve in the combination of Moist Heat and Dry Heat Method. In this technique, we must cook the food by using the Moist Heat Method then followed by Dry Heat Method. Other than that, the time consuming in cooking food by using this method is much longer rather than other technique and it can take about 5 to 6 hours to complete the cooking process. Besides that, I have learned that the food that is not cooked in the right ways will lose its nutrients.</p><p></p><p>Other than that, we can improve the quantity and quality of nutrients of the food if we used the correct cooking method. For the arts of seasoning and flavoring, I have learned that seasoning and flavoring is very important in improving the quality of the taste of food that we cooked. The seasoning that we used is to lighten up the taste of the food without changing its original flavor. Meanwhile, for flavoring we used it to give a different flavor to the food and completely flavoring is used to change the original flavor of the food.</p><p></p><p>Cooking methods in the culinary arts are divided into two categories: Dry heat cooking, such as roasting, broiling, or sautéeing. Moist heat cooking, such as braising, steaming, or poaching.</p><p>Dry heat cooking refers to any cooking technique where the heat is transferred to the food item without using any moisture. Dry-heat cooking typically involves high heat, with temperatures of 300 F or hotter. Baking or roasting in an oven is a dry heat method because it uses hot air to conduct the heat. Pan-searing a steak is considered dry-heat cooking because the heat transfer takes place through the hot metal of the pan.</p><p>Moist heat cooking methods include any techniques that involve cooking with moisture whether it's steam, water, stock, wine, or some other liquid. Cooking temperatures are much lower anywhere from 140 F to a maximum of 212 F, because water doesn't get any hotter than that. </p><p></p><p></p><p>i hope it can help.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cooking changes a vegetable's texture, flavor, color, and nutrient content. High temperatures make vegetables tender and enhance flavor. In addition, cooking usually makes vegetables safer to eat by killing microbes. Over- cooking, however, will cause texture, flavor, color, and nutrient content to deteriorate.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Cooking is a painstaking process, with all its measurements and all its instructions. The separation of some ingredients, the combination of others. Yet, cooking is also an unmindful activity, where you cease to be and you are the splendor of ingredients mixing to create a delightful product. There 's an intrinsic therapeutic aspect to cooking I had not realized until I started helping at Venice Family Clinic. I have come to learn that cooking is a contradictory art. It is both simple and complex.</p><p></p><p>That has changed me, especially when it comes to cooking. I understand cooking can be the tossing of a few chopped ingredients. It can be a diligent task of mixing, sautéing, mixing again, then baking. Most of the time, cooking can be a time consuming undertaking. I have had several talks with different patients about how difficult it sometimes is to find time to cook, especially a healthy meal, for themselves or their families. Indeed, I have found myself in that same spot several times. But ever since I have been interning at Venice I have tried to make more time to cook something healthy, knowing the option of purchasing food is not a great option at all. Because for the price I pay for a fast food meal, I also pay with my health.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Write it in your notebook.Cooking PoemWhen you're cooking in the kitchen,You're learning all the while --To pour and measure, mix and stirAnd sift flour into a pile.gearScrub your hands before you startThen gather up theLike pots'n pans and measuring cupsThat you use throughout the year.Go over the recipe, step-by-step,So you'll know just what to do.By carefully following the directions,It won't be hard for you.Have a hot pad handyAnd an adult standing by --So you won't hurt yourselfWhen using the stove or baking a pie.Besides the fun and learning,There's always cleaning up to do,And J8 even though it's quite a chore,It's part of cooking too.But after all the work is done,It will soon be time for dinner.And when someone asks for seconds,You'll know you've cooked a winner​</h2><br />
