Safe Choice :Instructions: Staying safe around electricity means making smart choices. Read each story and choose the safe choice for each character to make.
9. William was thrilled when his parents told him he would be spending the weekend with his grandmother. She had a room filled with old telephones, radios, and televisions that his grandfather used to repair. To William, it was like a treasure chest. Rummaging through dusty boxes, he found something unusual. It had an electric plug that looked a little frayed, but he couldn’t wait to see what it might do when switched on. What should he do? *
Choice A: Attempt to repair the cord with some tape before plugging it in.
Choice B: Not plug in the mystery object. Instead, give it to his grandfather for a professional to repair.
10. Splash! The radio bubbled as it sank to the bottom of the kitchen sink. Miguel was reaching for a paper towel for his little brother when his elbow accidentally bumped the radio.

Choice A: Keep his little brother away from the sink and tell his parents right away
Choice B: Reach into the sink and pull out the radio before it soaks up any more water.</a>

One day, Nico was asked by his mother to buy some groceries at the supermarket. While he was walking along the aisle of the store, he suddenly remembered that it was his grandmother's birthday! She's already old so Nico wants to buy a simple birthday present for her to make her happy. He reached for his coin pouch and counted his money. Unfortunately, he doesn't have any spare to buy a gift for her grandma. A man standing on a comer noticed Nico's sad face. He figured out the poor boy's problem, so he came closer to him and gave him a box of nicely baked cupcakes. Nico was surprised! The man who gave him cupcakes was Mr. Ramos, the Chief-of-police. Nico knew him when he did some cleaning work at the police station for some extra money. He immediately thanked him. But, instead of saying "You're welcome", Mr. Ramos simply said, "Stay kind and helpful young boy. I hope your grandma likes the cupcakes." 1. 2 3. 4. 5. B. Assessment Read the following sentences.

 D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>B. But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</p><p>This excerpt reveals the allegorical nature of the story because it shows that the character of the widow is symbolic of the idea of aging and the loss of beauty. She wishes that the coffin-lid were over her face, since it could be no longer beautiful, which is a metaphor for death and the end of life. This passage is showing how the characters in the story are symbols for deeper concepts and ideas.</p><br />
