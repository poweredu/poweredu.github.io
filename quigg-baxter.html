                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Act of God" is a short story that tells the tale of a young girl, Chidi, who lives in a small village in Nigeria. One day, a severe storm destroys her family's home and causes significant damage to the village. The story follows Chidi and her family's struggle to recover from the aftermath of the disaster.</p><p></p><p>The story highlights the vulnerability of people living in developing countries to natural disasters and the lack of support from the government and international aid organizations. It also highlights the resilience and strength of the community members who come together to help each other and rebuild their lives.</p><p></p><p>One of the main lessons from the story is the importance of preparedness for natural disasters. Developing countries are more vulnerable to natural disasters due to poor infrastructure and lack of resources. Therefore, it is crucial to have adequate emergency plans in place to minimize the impact of these disasters.</p><p></p><p>Another important lesson from the story is the need for international aid organizations and governments to provide support to developing countries during and after natural disasters. The lack of aid can exacerbate the suffering and prolong the recovery process.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, "Act of God" is a poignant reminder of the devastating impact of natural disasters on vulnerable communities and the importance of preparedness and support from governments and aid organizations.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps po </p><br />
