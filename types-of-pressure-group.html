Read it carefully and extract information using Paraphrase, Summary, and Precís.There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child make healthy, life-long choices1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group is immense.2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’ types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions.3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a position of having to make an on-the-spot decision.4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to say no to negative peer pressure.6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account.​</a>

                                            Please read this text afterwards, answer the questions that follows.
 There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child
make healthy, life-long choices:
1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or
otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken
influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group
is immense. 
2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one
or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This
could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’
types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental
maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions. 
3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior
centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager
hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks
at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a
position of having to make an on-the-spot decision. 
4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still
exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen
overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the
gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 
5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral
code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the
actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of
following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to
say no to negative peer pressure. 
6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are
healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer
group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced
to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young
teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account. 
1. Why do you think Peer Pressure is a good topic to read and share to
others?
2. Explain how the following skills help you in summarizing:
a. Getting the main idea:
__________________________________________________________________
b. Noting supporting details:
_________________________________________________________________
c. Paraphrasing:

d. Identifying text development:

e. Using correct grammatical features:

Teens see the actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to say no to negative peer pressure.6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account.1. Choose one paragraph and write a paraphrase.2. Choose three (3) paragraphs and cluster them into one paragraph​</h2><br />

                        METAMORPHISM
<p><strong>Metamorphism</strong> is from the word “meta” and “morphe” meaning “change” and “form”, respectively. In other words, <strong>metamorphism</strong> can be literally translated to “change of form”. <strong>Metamorphism</strong> is the change or transformation of rocks or minerals under various factors. <strong>Metamorphism</strong> is affected by factors like heat, reactive fluids, and pressure.
</p><p>
</p><p>Here are some facts about metamorphism.
</p><strong>D</strong>. Weathering is not a concept under metamorphosis.
<strong>C</strong>.  Pressure and heat cause a grain size to become course with the increasing change in depth.
<strong>C</strong>.  Water is the main factor of regional metamorphism.
<strong>B</strong>. The hornfels is a fine texture rock sample.
<strong>C</strong>. The metamorphism of sandstones results in marble.
<strong>B</strong>. Contact metamorphism is greatly affected by heat and reactive fluid factors.
<strong>A</strong>. Hornfels have fine or grain size texture.
<strong>D</strong>. Slate is influenced minimally by heat.
<strong>C</strong>. Pressure is not the main factor of contact metamorphism.
<strong>A</strong>. When heat is added, the grain size also increases in minerals.
<strong>A</strong>. Dolomite is different from feldspar, mica, and quartz.
<strong>A</strong>. Recrystallization and pressure are what cause lineation to deformed rocks.
<strong>C</strong>. Non-foliated is not connected with phyllite.
<strong>B</strong>. Pressure and temperature affect the rock depth and, as a whole, metamorphism.
<strong>B</strong>. Grain size is the best characteristic to evaluate under a magnifying glass.

                            26. Please read this text afterwards, answer the questions that follows.
 There are six types of peer pressure and tips for parents to help their child
make healthy, life-long choices:
1.Spoken peer pressure is when a teenager asks, suggests, persuades, or
otherwise directs another to engage in a specific behavior. If the spoken
influence takes place within a group, the pressure to go along with the group
is immense. 
2. With unspoken peer pressure, a teenager is exposed to the actions of one
or more peers and is left to choose whether they want to follow along. This
could take the form of fashion choices, personal interactions or ‘joining’
types of behavior (clubs, teams, etc). Many young teens lack the mental
maturity to control impulses and make wise long-term decisions. 
3. Direct peer pressure can be spoken or unspoken. It is normally behavior
centric. Examples of these kinds of behavior would be when a teenager
hands another teen an alcoholic drink, or make a sexual advance, or looks
at another student’s paper during a test. The other student is put in a
position of having to make an on-the-spot decision. 
4. Like unspoken peer pressure, indirect peer pressure is subtle but can still
exert a strong influence on an impressionable young person. When a teen
overhears a friend gossiping about another person and then reacts to the
gossip, that is indirect peer pressure. 
5. Asking a teenager to engage in behavior that is against his/her moral
code or family values is a type of negative peer pressure. Teens see the
actions of other teens with stronger personalities and are put in a position of
following the leader or walking away. Young people often lack the skills to
say no to negative peer pressure. 
6. A group of dynamic can be a positive peer influence if the behaviors are
healthy, age appropriate and socially acceptable. For instance, if a peer
group wants to make good grades, a young teen can be positively influenced
to study. Or if a popular friend wants to earn money and save, a young
teenager may also be influenced to save and open a savings account. 
1. Why do you think Peer Pressure is a good topic to read and share to
others?
2. Explain how the following skills help you in summarizing:
a. Getting the main idea:
__________________________________________________________________
b. Noting supporting details:
_________________________________________________________________
c. Paraphrasing:
__________________________________________________________________
d. Identifying text development:
_____________________________________________________________
e. Using correct grammatical features:
______________________________________________________
