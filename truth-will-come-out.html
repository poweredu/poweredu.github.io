                                            RIDDLE...? A man is traveling to a town and comes to a fork in the road. If he goes left, he goes to the liars’ village. If he goes right, he then goes to the village of truths – which is where he wants to go. However, he does not know which way is which.He doesn’t have time to go both routes, so he approaches a stranger who is standing in the middle of the fork. The stranger says he may only ask 3 questions and he will answer them.The man asks, “Are you from the village of truths?” The stranger says, “Yes!” However, the man is still facing a dilemma: If the stranger was from the village of truths he can only tell the truth, but if he was from the village of liars, he would say he was from the village of truth.So then he asks the stranger, “Are you telling the truth?” The stranger says, “Yes!” But sadly this leaves the man in the same position as before.Can you figure it out ?​</a>

Nearby was a village, and he was told to call for help if there was any danger. One day, in order to have some fun, he cried out with all his might. "The wolf is coming! The wolf is coming The men came running with clubs and axes to save the boy from the wolf. As they saw nothing, they went home again and left John laughing in his sleeve. Because he had had so much fun, John cried out again the next day. "The wolf! The wolff The men came again, but not as many as the first time. Again they saw no trace of the wolf, so they shook their heads and went back. On the third day, the wolf came in earnest. John cried in dismay, "Help! Help! The wolf! The wolf But not a single man came to help him. The wolf broke into the flock and killed a great many sheep. Among them was a beautiful lamb that belonged to John. Then he felt very sorry that he had deceived his friends and neighbors, and he grieved over the loss of his pet lamb. The truth itself is not believed, from one who often has deceived. 5.

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale
I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide</a>

                                            THE TORTOISE AND THE DUCKS
There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely for him all day, so he thought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and some excitement. He rushed down towards the village calling out “Wolf, Wolf,” and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable time. This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterward he tried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help. But shortly after this a Wolf did come out from the forest and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out “Wolf, Wolf,” still louder than before. But this time the villagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help. So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy’s flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said: “A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.”

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>This article examines truth criteria in qualitative research. The argument is made that qualitative educational research is being subtly undermined by mixed methods research and by ongoing bias by some quantitative researchers who transmit to their graduate students the message that qualitative research is plagued by subjectivity. The author contends that these trends are causing educational research to lose potential new qualitative researchers, to the detriment of the field.<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p> I'm not sure sinerch ko lang po : )<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To see that a research is precise or true and acceptable for everyday life.

                        <p>This quote suggests that the truth is powerful and will eventually be revealed, no matter how long it is hidden.

If he goes right, he then goes to the village of truths – which is where he wants to go. However, he does not know which way is which.He doesn’t have time to go both routes, so he approaches a stranger who is standing in the middle of the fork. The stranger says he may only ask 3 questions and he will answer them.The man asks, “Are you from the village of truths?” The stranger says, “Yes!” However, the man is still facing a dilemma: If the stranger was from the village of truths he can only tell the truth, but if he was from the village of liars, he would say he was from the village of truth.So then he asks the stranger, “Are you telling the truth?” The stranger says, “Yes!” But sadly this leaves the man in the same position as before.Can you figure it out ?​</h2><br />

                            23. THE SONG IS DEMONS
When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all and the blood's run stale
I want to hide the truth, I want to shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call is the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't want to let you down, but I am hell bound
Though this is all for you, don't want to hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I want to save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide</h2><br />

                            24. THE TORTOISE AND THE DUCKS
There was once a young Shepherd Boy who tended his sheep at the foot of a mountain near a dark forest. It was rather lonely for him all day, so he thought upon a plan by which he could get a little company and some excitement. He rushed down towards the village calling out “Wolf, Wolf,” and the villagers came out to meet him, and some of them stopped with him for a considerable time. This pleased the boy so much that a few days afterward he tried the same trick, and again the villagers came to his help. But shortly after this a Wolf did come out from the forest and began to worry the sheep, and the boy of course cried out “Wolf, Wolf,” still louder than before. But this time the villagers, who had been fooled twice before, thought the boy was again deceiving them, and nobody stirred to come to his help. So the Wolf made a good meal off the boy’s flock, and when the boy complained, the wise man of the village said: “A liar will not be believed, even when he speaks the truth.”
