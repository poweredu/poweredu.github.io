How would you evaluate the overall written text? Does it clearly and effectively explain the scientific concepts in the study?5. What features of scientific writing are present in the text? Cite details to support your answer.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The topic of the study is whether the body can be considered a machine.The study tries to fill the knowledge gap regarding the use of the metaphor of the body as a machine, and whether this metaphor accurately reflects the functioning of the human body. It also explores the implications of this metaphor in the fields of medicine, biology, and philosophy.The implications of the study in the target field are significant, as it challenges the widely-held belief that the body can be reduced to a set of mechanical parts and functions. This has important implications for how we think about and approach the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions, as well as our understanding of the nature of life and consciousness.The overall written text is clear and effective in explaining the scientific concepts in the study. It provides a thorough analysis of the metaphor of the body as a machine and its limitations and presents compelling arguments to support its conclusions.The text exhibits several features of scientific writing, such as a clear and concise style, a focus on evidence-based reasoning, and an objective tone. For example, the text uses scientific terminology to describe complex concepts (e.g. "homeostasis", "cytoskeleton"), provides references to support its claims, and avoids the use of subjective language or opinions.<br />

What might happen to the frequency of an EM wave as its wavelength becomes longer?and what may happen also on its energy?2.Does changing magnetic field produce an electric field and a changing electric field produces amagnetic field?accelerating electrons produced electromagnetic waves.3. From this concept of EM waves, cite the advantage and disadvantage of the modern technologicalworld in our economy and industry?III. Read and study the problem below. Copy the problem and use GRESA to solve the problemWrite your answer on the answer sheet provided.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> 1.So, if the wavelength of a light wave is shorter, that means that the frequency will be higher because one cycle can pass in a shorter amount of time. ... That means that longer wavelengths have a lower frequency. Conclusion: a longer wavelength means a lower frequency, and a shorter wavelength means a higher frequency!</p><p>2.Then they cannot be treated independently of each other, because the changing electric field produces a changing magnetic field and the newly produced changing magnetic field produces a changing electric field, which is an electromagnetic wave.</p><p>3.</p><p> They are electromagnetic waves with wavelengths just shorter than those of visible light. Advantages: In small quantities they help your body produce vitamin D. Disadvantages: They can cause sunburn or even skin cancer if used in large quantities.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. As a wavelength increases in size, its frequency and energy (E) decrease. From these equations you may realize that as the frequency increases, the wavelength gets shorter.</p><p>2. Accelerating charges produce changing electric and magnetic fields. Changing electric fields produce magnetic fields and changing magnetic fields produce electric fields. This interplay between induced electric and magnetic fields leads to propagating electromagnetic waves.</p><p>3. <strong>Advantages</strong>.
</p><p>-Independent learning has become easier and more effective.
</p><p>-Good preparation for the future.
</p><p>-Modern technology has lowered tuition and textbook prices.
</p><p>-Learning with technology is much more interesting.
</p><p>-New teaching methods are being developed.
</p><p><strong>Disadvantages</strong>.
</p><p>-Lack of interest in hard work.</p><p>-Misuse of technology</p><p>-Instructional challenges</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1Usually included within the social sciences are cultural (or social) anthropology, sociology, psychology, political science, and economics. The discipline of historiography is regarded by many as a social science, and certain areas of historical study are almost indistinguishable from work done in the social sciences</p><p>2.Geography is often defined in terms of two branches: human geography and physical geography</p><p>3Historical method is the collection of techniques and guidelines that historians use to research and write histories of the past. Secondary sources, primary sources and material evidence such as that derived from archaeology may all be drawn on, and the historian's skill lies in identifying these sources, evaluating their relative authority, and combining their testimony appropriately in order to construct an accurate and reliable picture of past events and environments.</p><p>4Here be dragons" means dangerous or unexplores territories</p><p>5In this ever changing, interdependent world, students need a geographic awareness that includes familiarity with different cultures, beliefs, and lifestyles to understand and address global issues.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>same lection tayo</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. The major finding of Anna Frebel and Timothy Beers in their 2018 study was that heaviest elements may not formed from explosions but from neutron star mergers.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.In linguistics, discourse refers to a unit of language longer than a single sentence. The word discourse is derived from the latin prefix dis- meaning "away" and the root word currere meaning "to run". Discourse, therefore, translates to "run away" and refers to the way that conversations flow.</p><p></p><p>2.Discourse is one of the four systems of language, the others being vocabulary, grammar and phonology. Discourse has various definitions but one way of thinking about it is as any piece of extended language, written or spoken, that has unity and meaning and purpose.</p><p></p><p>3.Anthropologists tackle big human problems, such as overpopulation, warfare, and poverty. What do you want to do? Anthropological study and training provide the knowledge, skills and tools to work with people, study the past, and shape the future.</p><br />
