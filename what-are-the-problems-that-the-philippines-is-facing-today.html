                                            What do you think are the best remedy to help solve the three major problems that the correction in faces in the Philippines today?ANSWER:The good way to do, in my opinion, to tackle the problem of corrections here in the Philippines is. To reduce crime in our country, first provide appropriate facilities and large spaces for offenders, as well as increase punishment. Second, address the lack of training by providing adequate equipment and necessities. Finally, construct buildings to improve prison conditions, as well as provide adequate equipment and engage in relevant activities for inmates.​</a>
