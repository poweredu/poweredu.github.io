                                            Exercise 149 Roadways in the Air Have you ever visited an airfield? There are air- planes landing or leaving the busy airfield during the whole day. Have you ever wondered why planes do not collide in the air? There are traffic rules for the planes in the air as there are traffic rules for the cars in the road. There are airways or roads in the sky through which planes must travel. All planes are guided by air-traffic controls. They must fly at designated heights so that planes coming from opposite directions fly at different heights or air-roads. Every plane is fully equipped with instruments, and, unless these instruments become out of order, air collision is not possible. 1. Write the word that tells where airplanes land or leave.​</a>

When was Proxima Centauri discovered?
How was Proxima Centauri discovered?
How have scientists researched Proxima Centauri?
What technologies have they used? What types of data do these technologies collect?
Have spacecraft ever reached this star?
What are the limitations of sending spacecraft to Proxima Centauri?
What accommodations would humans need to travel to Proxima Centauri?

Sometimes it bounces back intothe direction of the source. We call this reflection. Water,into your workwha wave. Other scientists says that light behaves like a group of particles.windows, shiny metal and mirrors are just some of themany objects that reflect light. As light travels, it travels in astraight line. However, when light passes from one materialMany scientist have been studying the nature of light. Some say that light behaves likeLight travels in a straight line when going to through a single medium, any substancesthrough which light wave can travel.In some media, such as air, light travels quickly.

Today, they test this conjecture in a more for- mal manner, holding all variables con- stant except the height at which the top of the ramp is set.

                            24. Exercise 149 Roadways in the Air Have you ever visited an airfield? There are air- planes landing or leaving the busy airfield during the whole day. Have you ever wondered why planes do not collide in the air? There are traffic rules for the planes in the air as there are traffic rules for the cars in the road. There are airways or roads in the sky through which planes must travel. All planes are guided by air-traffic controls. They must fly at designated heights so that planes coming from opposite directions fly at different heights or air-roads. Every plane is fully equipped with instruments, and, unless these instruments become out of order, air collision is not possible. 1. Write the word that tells where airplanes land or leave.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Airfield               </p><p><strong>Explanation:  </strong> <br />An airfield is a place where airplanes land and take off. It is a designated area of land or water that is used for the operation of aircraft. Airfields can vary in size and can be used for different types of aircraft, such as commercial airlines, private planes, and military aircraft. They usually have a runway, which is a strip of pavement or concrete where planes can take off and land, as well as other infrastructure such as hangars, terminal buildings, and control towers. Airfields can be found at airports, military bases, and other locations. They are an important part of the aviation industry, allowing planes to safely and efficiently travel to and from different destinations.                   </p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the airplaned land on the place no people around </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p>I've always wanted to work in a foreign country since perhaps the culture is completely different from ours. It doesn't matter to me; as long as I can work and rest at the same time, I'm happy. Because other currencies differ from ours, their funds are sometimes much larger than ours, making it easier to generate money than in our own country.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p>I've Visited Bicol </p><p></p><p>The Bicol are largely an agricultural and rural people, producing rice, coconuts, and hemp. Nearly all of them are Roman Catholics. Their language is closely related to others of the central Philippines, all of which belong to the Austronesian (Malayo-Polynesian) family of languages.Some persisting traditional practices are the pamalay, pantomina and tigsikan. Beliefs on god, the soul and life after death are strongly held by the people. Related to these, there are annual rituals like the pabasa, tanggal, fiestas and flores de mayo</p><br />
