Every morning, George wokes up to the sound of his alarm. It's four o'clock in the morning. He just had three hours of sleep coming from a two-hour battle with traffic going home the previous night. Now, he has to get up again,take a bath, and prepared him self for another two hours of tiresome commute back to work.4. Last week, our class planted some bean seeds in ice-cream cups. We watered the seeds. After that we placed the cups on the window sill in the sun. About five days later, we observed that some of the seeds were beginning to germinate. A few days later, the plants had started to sprout leaves. By the end of the week, they were about seven centimeters tall.5. Why does it rain? Warm air turns the water from rivers,lakes, and oceans into water vapor that rises into the air. That water vapors form clouds, which contain small drops of water or ice crystals (depending on how high the clouds is and how cold it is) As cloud rise higher and higher, the air gets colder and colder. When the water vapor in the cloud becomes too heavy, it falls back to the ground as rain or snow.NASA PICTURE 1 &amp; 2 PA ANSWER PO I WILL BRAINLIEST THE CORRECT ANSWER​</a>

                            7. Learning Task 3: Identify the passage whether it is expository, narrative, persuasive, explanatory, personal and Factual Recount.3. Every morning, George wokes up to the sound of his alarm. It's four o'clock in the morning. He just had three hours of sleep coming from a two-hour battle with traffic going home the previous night. Now, he has to get up again,take a bath, and prepared him self for another two hours of tiresome commute back to work.4. Last week, our class planted some bean seeds in ice-cream cups. We watered the seeds. After that we placed the cups on the window sill in the sun. About five days later, we observed that some of the seeds were beginning to germinate. A few days later, the plants had started to sprout leaves. By the end of the week, they were about seven centimeters tall.5. Why does it rain? Warm air turns the water from rivers,lakes, and oceans into water vapor that rises into the air. That water vapors form clouds, which contain small drops of water or ice crystals (depending on how high the clouds is and how cold it is) As cloud rise higher and higher, the air gets colder and colder. When the water vapor in the cloud becomes too heavy, it falls back to the ground as rain or snow.NASA PICTURE 1 &amp; 2 PA ANSWER PO I WILL BRAINLIEST THE CORRECT ANSWER​</h2><br />
