During the middle part of the 19th century, while the Philippines was under a colonial rule, there was born a boy who would yearslater emerge as a great nationalist and one of the Filipino patriots to have fought for the emancipation of the natives from the bondageof colonization. He came to be known for his writings like the Noli Me Tangere. He was no less than Jose Rizal.2. As soon as the La Liga Filipina died a natural death with the exile of Jose Rizal in Dapitan, on July 7, 1892, the Kataastaasan,Kagaanggaangan, Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan was organized with Andres Bonifacio as its founding leader. The allegedrevolutionary group anchored its existence from documents like the Kartilya ng Katipunan and its constitution and by-laws andpropagated its cause through its newspaper-the Kalayaan. These documents were crafted by the so called Brains of the Katipunanin the person of Apolinario Mabini.3. Andres Bonifacio was believed to have completed his primary education but failed to proceed to the secondary school. Despitethis academic handicap, he managed to read books and one of his favorite reading materials was a novel entitled Les Miserables.He must have drawn some inspiration from this novel that he was motivated to write a poem he entitled Pag-ibig sa TinubuangLupa, a poem which was given a beautiful music by the duo of Inang Laya. This is a fact or bluff?​</a>

A brilliant medical student, he soon committedhimself to the reform of Spanish rule in his home country, though he neveradvocated Philippine independence. Most of his writing was done in Europe,where he resided between 1882 and 1892.In 1887 Rizal published his first novel, Noli me tangere (The Social Cancer), apassionate exposure of the evils of Spanish rule in the Philippines. A sequel, Elfilibusterismo (1891; The Reign of Greed), established his reputation as theleading spokesman of the Philippine reform movement. He publishedan annotated edition (1890; reprinted 1958) of Antonio Morga's Sucesos delas Islas Filipinas, hoping to show that the native people of the Philippines hada long history before the coming of the Spaniards. He became the leader ofthe Propaganda Movement, contributing numerous articles to itsnewspaper, La Solidaridad published in Barcelona. Rizal's political programincluded integration of the Philippines as a province of Spain, representationin the Cortes (the Spanish parliament), the replacement of Spanish friars byFilipino priests, freedom of assembly and expression, and equality of Filipinosand Spaniards before the law.Patulong po please​</a>

During the middle part of the 19th century, while the Philippines was under a colonial rule, there was born a boy who would yearslater emerge as a great nationalist and one of the Filipino patriots to have fought for the emancipation of the natives from the bondageof colonization. He came to be known for his writings like the Noli Me Tangere. He was no less than Jose Rizal.2. As soon as the La Liga Filipina died a natural death with the exile of Jose Rizal in Dapitan, on July 7, 1892, the Kataastaasan,Kagaanggaangan, Katipunan ng mga Anak ng Bayan was organized with Andres Bonifacio as its founding leader. The allegedrevolutionary group anchored its existence from documents like the Kartilya ng Katipunan and its constitution and by-laws andpropagated its cause through its newspaper-the Kalayaan. These documents were crafted by the so called Brains of the Katipunanin the person of Apolinario Mabini.3. Andres Bonifacio was believed to have completed his primary education but failed to proceed to the secondary school. Despitethis academic handicap, he managed to read books and one of his favorite reading materials was a novel entitled Les Miserables.He must have drawn some inspiration from this novel that he was motivated to write a poem he entitled Pag-ibig sa TinubuangLupa, a poem which was given a beautiful music by the duo of Inang Laya.
