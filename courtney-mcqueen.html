                                            Review Before we proceed to our lesson, I want you to answer this activity. Situational Analysis Analyze the situations below and complete the given statement in each item by applying the basic concepts and principles of the major social science ideas (Psychoanalysis &amp; Rational Choice). SITUATION A Courtney is extremely anxious about taking her first midterm in her biology class. The night before her midterm she doesn't think she can succeed on the exam. She expects to fail even if she studies, so she decides to go to the bar and drinks excessively. She later uses the alcohol consumed in the bar instead of lack of ability to justify her grade. She is using a behavior known as a SITUATION B Julie is a sophomore in college. She loves everyone she meets, and is always desiring to have a lot of friends. She never seems satisfied with the friends she already has. Julie is probably high in SITUATION C Almost every weekend, Jen goes to all the parties she hears about. Once there, she goes around introducing herself and asking for phone numbers from those she meets. The next day, she spends hours talking on the phone to the new friends she made, telling them about herself such as her future goal of becoming a wedding coordinator; in this occupation she can meet new people and always be aware of "who's marrying who". Which motive would Jen probably score highly on? ​ </a>

                                            Courtney and her college roommate made travel plans to go to Cancun for spring break. Neither one of them ever bothered to wear sunscreen, thinking that they would get a better suntan without it. When the women reached their forties, they were both diagnosed with malignant melanoma. Why has the risk of developing melanoma doubled over the last 15 years? What is the prognosis for someone diagnosed with malignant melanoma?​</a>

From Missing Their Peers to Lack or Class Discussions, Students Bare Factors Causing Them Stress By Courtney Louise Castro Monday, November 30, 2020 Blended learning poses many challenges to students, thus the need to make them aware of their stressors events or conditions in surroundings that may trigger stress and how to deal with them. Psychologist and educator Joanne Javier says distance learning can cause higher levels of stress. Javier has some suggestions on how to deal with students' stress because of blended learning First, identify the stressors. Is it the workload? Is it the lack of communication with peers? Is it the lack of rest? Recognize the triggers of stress, before dealing with them. Second, find ways that work to address the stressors. These ways are considered as self-care initiatives. If the stressor, for instance, is lack of interaction, keep constant communication with peers. Third, practice studying methods such as the Pomodoro technique. This means that for every 25 minutes of work, there should be a break of five minutes. For the fourth repetition of the 25-minute work, a 15-to 20-minute break must be dedicated. This way, students are able to regain their thought processes, achieve more, and stay consistent If some stressors are almost impossible to deal with, Javier recommends seeking help. It is inevitable for students to experience stress, given the new setup, so they must learn how to deal with the stressors in healthy ways. Questions: 1. What is the title of the article? 2.

SITUATION A Courtney is extremely anxious about taking her first midterm in her biology class. The night before her midterm she doesn't think she can succeed on the exam. She expects to fail even if she studies, so she decides to go to the bar and drinks excessively. She later uses the alcohol consumed in the bar instead of lack of ability to justify her grade. She is using a behavior known as a SITUATION B Julie is a sophomore in college. She loves everyone she meets, and is always desiring to have a lot of friends. She never seems satisfied with the friends she already has. Julie is probably high in SITUATION C Almost every weekend, Jen goes to all the parties she hears about. Once there, she goes around introducing herself and asking for phone numbers from those she meets. The next day, she spends hours talking on the phone to the new friends she made, telling them about herself such as her future goal of becoming a wedding coordinator; in this occupation she can meet new people and always be aware of "who's marrying who".

                            7. Courtney and her college roommate made travel plans to go to Cancun for spring break. Neither one of them ever bothered to wear sunscreen, thinking that they would get a better suntan without it. When the women reached their forties, they were both diagnosed with malignant melanoma. Why has the risk of developing melanoma doubled over the last 15 years? What is the prognosis for someone diagnosed with malignant melanoma?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Among all people with melanoma of the skin, from the time of initial diagnosis, the 5-year survival is 92%. Overall survival at 5 years depends on the thickness of the primary melanoma, whether the lymph nodes are involved, and whether there is spread of melanoma to distant sites.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Melanoma, also known as malignant melanoma, is a type of skin cancer that develops from the pigment-producing cells known as melanocytes. Melanomas typically occur in the skin but may rarely occur in the mouth, intestines or eye (uveal melanoma)</p><br />

From Missing Their Peers to Lack or Class Discussions, Students Bare Factors Causing Them Stress By Courtney Louise Castro Monday, November 30, 2020 Blended learning poses many challenges to students, thus the need to make them aware of their stressors events or conditions in surroundings that may trigger stress and how to deal with them. Psychologist and educator Joanne Javier says distance learning can cause higher levels of stress. Javier has some suggestions on how to deal with students' stress because of blended learning First, identify the stressors. Is it the workload? Is it the lack of communication with peers? Is it the lack of rest? Recognize the triggers of stress, before dealing with them. Second, find ways that work to address the stressors. These ways are considered as self-care initiatives. If the stressor, for instance, is lack of interaction, keep constant communication with peers. Third, practice studying methods such as the Pomodoro technique. This means that for every 25 minutes of work, there should be a break of five minutes. For the fourth repetition of the 25-minute work, a 15-to 20-minute break must be dedicated. This way, students are able to regain their thought processes, achieve more, and stay consistent If some stressors are almost impossible to deal with, Javier recommends seeking help. It is inevitable for students to experience stress, given the new setup, so they must learn how to deal with the stressors in healthy ways. Questions: 1. What is the title of the article? 2.

                            21. From Missing Their Peers to Lack of Class Discussions, Students BareFactors Causing Them StressBy Courtney Louise Castro Monday, November 30, 2020Blended learning poses many challenges to students, thus the need to makethem aware of their stressors events or conditions in surroundings thatmay trigger stress and how to deal with themPsychologist and educator Joanne Javier says distance learning can causehigher levels of stress.Javier has some suggestions on how to deal with students' stress because ofblended learning.First, identify the stressors. Is it the workload? Is it the lack ofcommunication with peers? Is it the lack of rest? Recognize the triggers ofstress, before dealing with them.Second, find ways that work to address the stressors. These ways areconsidered as self-care initiatives. If the stressor, for instance, is lack ofinteraction, keep constant communication with peers.Third, practice studying methods such as the Pomodoro technique.This means that for every 25 minutes of work, there should be a break offive minutes. For the fourth repetition of the 25-minute work, a 15- to 20-minute break must be dedicated. This way, students are able to regain theirthought processes, achieve more, and stay consistent.If some stressors are almost impossible to deal with, Javier recommendsseeking help. It is inevitable for students to experience stress, given the newsetup, so they must learn how to deal with the stressors in healthy ways.Excerpt from From Missing Their Peers To Lack of Class Discussions, Students Bare Factors Causing Them Stressaccessed from One news.ph this is srticeo​</h2><br />
