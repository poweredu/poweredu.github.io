Activity 1: Post-War Philippine Literature in a Nutshell The rise of fluent writers in English during the post-war period up to the present shows how flexible, imaginative, and talented Filipinos are. Rizal’s influence is eminent among the social realist writers. Spanish influences can still be observed in terms of cultures and languages used in literature by some prominent writers such as Nick Joaquin. Our experiences during colonial period which stretches up to the present truly reflected in the most notable Filipino works in the field of literature.

Contemporary Historical Period Language or Medium Used Dominant Literary Forms or Genres Theme/ Subject Some Notable Writers and their Literary Works Third Republic (1946-1972) Fourth Republic (1972-1986) Martial Law Period or New Republic Fifth Republic (1986- present)​</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Published in 1946, Ginto Sa Makiling – a novel by Macario Pineda, is the first work of note that appeared after the second world war. In plot, it hews close to the mode of romantic fantasy traceable to the awits, koridos and komedyas of the Balagtas tradition. But it is a symbolical narrative of social, moral and political import. In this, it resembles not only Balagtas but also Rizal, but in style and plot it is closer to Balagtas in not allowing the realistic mode to restrict the element of fantasy.</p><p></p><p>       Two novels by writers in English dealt with the war experience: (Medina, p. 194) Stevan Javellana’s Without Seeing the Dawn (1947), and Edilberto Tiempo’s Watch in the Night. Both novels hew closely to the realist tradition. Lazaro Francisco, the eminent Tagalog novelist of the pre-war years, was to continue to produce significant work. He revised his Bayaning Nagpatiwakal (1932), refashioning its plot and in sum honing his work as a weapon against the policies that tended to perpetuate American economic dominance over the Philippines. The updated novel was titled Ilaw Sa Hilaga (1948) (Lumbera, p. 67). He was to produce three more novels.Sugat Sa Alaala (1950) reflects the horrors of the war experience as well as the human capacity for nobility, endurance and love under the most extreme circumstances. Maganda Pa Ang Daigdig (1956) deals with the agrarian issue, and Daluyong (1962) deals with the corruption bred by the American-style and American-educated pseudo-reformers. Lazaro Francisco is a realist with social and moral ideals. The Rizal influence on his work is profound.</p><p></p><p>       The poet Amado Hernandez, who was also union leader and social activist, also wrote novels advocating social change. Luha ng Buwaya (1963) (Lumbera) deals with the struggle between the oppressed peasantry and the class of politically powerful landlords. Mga Ibong Mandaragit (1969) deals with the domination of Filipinos by American industry (Lumbera, p. 69).</p><p></p><p>       Unfortunately, the Rizalian path taken by Lazaro Francisco and Amado Hernandez with its social-realist world-view had the effect of alienating them from the mode of the highly magical oral-epic tradition. Imported social realism (and, in the case of Amado Hernandez, a brand of socialist empiricism), was not entirely in touch with the folk sentiment and folk belief, which is why the Tagalog romances (e.g., Ginto Sa Makiling, serialized in the comics), were far more popular than their work.</p><p></p><p>       </p><br />
