                                            “Research”Debbie and Jenjen were both grade five pupils like you. They were tasked tohave a research on Conservation of the Estuaries and Intertidal Zones. They wereplanning on how they could come-up with a good report and a presentation.Debbie: Jen, do you already have any idea on how we could make our project the mostcomprehensive and informative report?Jen: But of course, sis! First, we need to tell what estuaries and intertidal zones are,their benefits, and the things or actions that can disturb and damage them.Debbie: Can't you remember? They were discussed already by Sir Regie.Jen: I know, sis. In our report, we would not be conversing so much about estuariesand intertidal zones, their benefits to us and to the environment, and the factors thatcould destroy them. The said facts would only serve as sneak preview and anintroduction of what we would be talking over.Debbie: Alright! It sounds worthy. We better work on that straightaway.The two prepared the outline of what they would be tackling.DiodI. What is an ecosystem?A. It is a biological community of interacting organisms and their physicalenvironment.B. Ecosystems are the interactions of the living (biotic) and non-living(abiotic) things in an area.C. Ecosystems can be very small or large, depending on where you draw theline.5II.What are the examples of ecosystems?A. Estuaries (the tidal mouth of a large river, where the tide meets thestream)B. Intertidal zones (the intertidal zone is the zone between the high tide andlow tide, also referred to as the foreshore, seashore, or littoral zone. It is,hence, an environment where seawater and air are interchangedrepeatedly from the constant breaking and receding of waves.)​</a>

                                            What's New To make your learning more fun, read the short story of two grade 5 pupils who were assigned to make a list of activities leading to the conservation of the estuaries and intertidal zones. Enjoy! “Research Debbie and Jenjen were both grade five pupils like you. They were tasked to have a research on Conservation of the Estuaries and Intertidal Zones. They were planning on how they could come up with a good report and a presentation. Debbie: Jen, do you already have any idea on how we could make our project the most comprehensive and informative report? Jen: But of course, sis! First, we need to tell what estuaries and intertidal zones are, their benefits, and the things or actions that can disturb and damage them. Debbie: Can't you remember? They were discussed already by Sir Regle. Jen: I know, sis. In our report, we would not be conversing so much about estuaries and intertidal zones, their benefits to us and to the environment, and the factors that could destroy them. The said facts would only serve as sneak preview and an introduction of what we would be talking over. Debbie: Alright! It sounds worthy. We better work on that straightaway. The two prepared the outline of what they would be tackling. 1. What is an ecosystem? A. It is a biological community of interacting organisms and their physical environment. B. Ecosystems are the interactions of the living (biotic) and non-living (abiotic) things in an area. C. Ecosystems can be very small or large, depending on where you draw the line. II. What are the examples of ecosystems? A. Estuaries (the tidal mouth of a large river, where the tide meets the stream) B. Intertidal zones (the intertidal zone is the zone between the high tide and low tide, also referred to as the foreshore, seashore, or littoral zone. It is, hence, an environment where seawater and air are interchanged repeatedly from the constant breaking and receding of waves.) 4​</a>

It can be divided into several zones, such as the splash (spray) zone, middle intertidal zone, and the zone only exposed during tides. This area is regularly covered and uncovered by the tide and is home to many species of plants and animals. The middle intertidal zone may also be referred to as the mudflats.</p><br />
