                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The history of the Philippines is believed to have begun with the arrival of the first humans using rafts or boats[1][2][3] at least 709,000 years ago as suggested by the discovery of Pleistocene stone tools and butchered animal remains associated with hominin activity.[4] Homo luzonensis, a species of archaic humans, was present on the island of Luzon at least 67,000 years ago.[5][6] The earliest known modern human was from Tabon Cave in Palawan dating about 47,000 years.[7] Negrito groups were the first inhabitants to settle in the prehistoric Philippines. After that, groups of Austronesians later migrated to the island</p><p></p><p>i hope this is helpfull for you uwu</p><br />

                            2. a short poem or a short story that has influenced by culture, history or environment.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Introduction: Presenting the Main Idea</strong></p><p><strong>Regardless of what method you use, it is always sound to begin your analysis with a paragraph that provides the context of the work you are analyzing and a brief account of what you believe to be the poem or story or play’s main theme. At a minimum, your account of the work’s context will include the name of the author, the title of the work, its genre, and the date and place of publication. If there is an important biographical or historical context to the work, you should include that, as well. However, don’t get lost in details. Your audience except a concise (meaning short) level of background. Next, try to express the work’s theme in one or two sentences. Theme is that insight into human experience the author offers to readers, usually revealed as the content, the drama, the plot of the poem, story, or play unfolds and the characters interact. Assessing theme can be a complex task. Authors usually show the theme; they don’t tell it. They rarely say, at the end of the story, words to this effect: “and the moral of my story is…” They tell their story, develop their characters, provide some kind of conflict—and from all of this theme emerges. Because identifying theme can be challenging and subjective, it is often a good idea to work through the rest of the analysis, then return to the beginning and assess theme in light of your analysis of the work’s other literary elements.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Example Introduction Paragraph</strong></p><p><strong>Here is a good example of an introductory paragraph from Ben’s analysis of William Butler Yeats’ poem, “Among School Children.”</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>“Among School Children” was published in Yeats’ 1928 collection of poems The Tower. It was inspired by a visit Yeats made in 1926 to school in Waterford, an official visit in his capacity as a senator of the Irish Free State. In the course of the tour, Yeats reflects upon his own youth and the experiences that shaped the “sixty-year old, smiling public man” (line 8) he has become. Through his reflection, the theme of the poem emerges: a life has meaning when connections among apparently disparate experiences are forged into a unified whole.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Conclusion: Avoid Repeating Claims</strong></p><p><strong>The concluding paragraph of your analysis should realize two goals. First, it should present your own opinion on the quality of the poem or story or play about which you have been writing. And, second, it should comment on the current relevance of the work. You should certainly comment on the enduring social relevance of the work you are explicating. You may comment, though you should never be obliged to do so, on the personal relevance of the work. Here is the concluding paragraph from Dao-Ming’s analysis of Oscar Wilde’s The Importance of Being Earnest.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The influence between the Iliad and Alexander went both ways. Having drawn inspiration from the epic, Alexander gave back to Homer by turning Greek into the common language of a large region, thus laying the infrastructure for turning the Iliad into world literature. Alexander’s successors built the great libraries of Alexandria and of Pergamum that would preserve Homer for the future.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>hope to help</p><p></p><br />

                        <p> </p><p>Once upon a time in the Philippines, there was a small village nestled in the heart of a lush forest. The villagers lived a simple life, relying on the bounty of the forest and the sea for their livelihood. They were a community of hardworking and hospitable people, always ready to lend a hand to their neighbors.</p><p></p><p>One day, a group of foreign invaders landed on the shores of the village. They came with weapons and a thirst for gold and power. The villagers were caught off guard and had no means to defend themselves against the invaders. They watched in horror as their homes were burned, their crops destroyed, and their loved ones taken captive.</p><p></p><p>But there was one brave young man named Jose who refused to give up. He remembered the stories his grandfather had told him about the bravery of their ancestors who fought against foreign invaders in the past. Jose knew that he had to act fast if he wanted to save his village.</p><p></p><p>He rallied the villagers and convinced them to use their knowledge of the forest to their advantage. They set traps, made weapons out of bamboo, and used the element of surprise to fight back against the invaders. The villagers fought with all their might, and in the end, they emerged victorious.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, the villagers lived in peace and prosperity. They celebrated their victory with a feast and a dance, and Jose became a hero in their eyes. He had shown them that even in the face of adversity, they could overcome any obstacle if they worked together and never gave up.</p><p></p><p>This story represents the resilience and resourcefulness of the Filipino people, who have faced countless challenges throughout their history but have always found a way to persevere. It also highlights the importance of preserving the environment and the knowledge of our ancestors, which can be invaluable in times of crisis.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

                            7. Kindly give a short story about history of an atom​</h2><br />
                        Atoms.<p><strong></strong></p><p>Chemistry is a branch in science where composition, structure, properties, and interactions of matter is studied; one part of this is atomic structure, this tells you what an atom is, what property it contains, how it is formed, and other related information. An atom is a particle of a substance which is usually described as a building block of matter. These particles are one of the smallest parts of matter. Although atoms are incredibly tiny, there are even other fragments that are smaller; these fragments are called subatomic particles, which include: the proton, neutron and electron (they make up the atom). The proton and neutron make up the nucleus (centre), and the electrons surround it. But for the protons and neutrons to interact in the nucleus, they exchange pions; a pion is a strong force that pulls protons and neutrons together when the protons and neutrons exchange it. This procedure can be similar to the process of to two people having a game of catch with a heavy ball, which is connected to each player by a spring. When the ball is thrown to a person from the other, the thrower is pulled towards the ball by the spring. If this occurs fast enough, these objects will seem to become blurry, and the two throwers look like they are being pulled toward each other. When using this example to represent what happens to the nucleus, the protons and neutrons are the throwers, the pions take place for the ball, and the strong force acts as the springs holding everything together. But pions are not the only type of force, there are also: electromagnetic forces, strong forces, and weak forces; electromagnetic forces are the forces that cause opposite electric charges to attract each other (one attraction is the magnetism of the negatively charged electrons, and the positively charged protons); strong forces are forces that hold the nuclei of an atom, preventing the positively charged protons from repelling each other, but this force is not enough, it also needs the neutron which have no electric charge(so does not increase the electromagnetic repulsion), to make nucleus stable; and the weak force is a force which weaker than the electromagnetic and strong forces, but can be used for more particles of the atom, one use is the conversion of the properties, for example: when there are too many protons or neutrons, for the nucleus to hold together, that the strong force squeezes too tightly, eventually, one particle will become changed into another type by the weak force.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We know that life began at least 3.5 billion years ago, because that is the age of the oldest rocks with fossil evidence of life on earth. These rocks are rare because subsequent geologic processes have reshaped the surface of our planet, often destroying older rocks while making new ones.</p><br />

1. How does the story reflect the history of the Philippines?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>SUMMARY</p><p>Sam Christie and Philip Latak were best of friends and that was possible because they worked in the same office. On one December dawn, Sam Christie was on his way to Ifugao with his native assistant. It was his last month in the Philippines and in a matter of days he would return to Boston for that leave which he had not had in years. During their journey, they talked about the grandfather of Philip and the different views in the Ifugao. Philip encountered an acquaintance that he did not want to recognize because the latter called him by his native name. When they had arrived on the village of Philip Latak, they met Sadek, Philip’s brother. From there, Philip told Sam how his brother, as well as all the others in the village, disliked him. After staying for quite some time in the house of Sadek, they went to Philip’s grandfather; but only Philip went inside to meet and talk to the elder. They visited the Mission the following day after having hiked to the villages. And there Reverend Doone invited them for lunch. He told them how he reminisced San Francisco and how he feels like home. Going down the hill, Sam told Philip that he would not leave Ifugao without a god because it’s more than a souvenir and it would remind him of Philip. Philip then told Sam that he would steal a god for him since he made the vacation and the raise possible. They hiked to the village and this time it was not as difficult as it had been the previous day. When they reached the village, they went to the grandfather of Philip. Sam was pleased with the prospect of being inside a native Ifugao house for the first time. He was able to see the Ifugao god for the first time, and he witnessed the rite wherein the blood of the slaughtered pig was poured on the head of the idol, and was returned to where it was kept. The feast began. For some time, Sam Christie was entertained by the dances and the songs, but soon he was bored. He told Philip that he would like to return to the boarding house. The feast began. For some time, Sam Christie was entertained by the dances and the songs, but soon he was bored. He told Philip that he would like to return to the boarding house. Philip told Sam that he would not be going back to Manila and that he was the reason his grandfather is dead. From that moment, their friendship was broken. Philip Latak did not, even once, face Sam. He seemed completely absorbed in his work. Sam knew then that Philip was determined to stay and break his bonds with Sam. Sam realized that Philip was carving a new god to replace the one he stole from his grandfather.</p><p></p><p>1.  This story reflects the history f the Philippines because of the colonial era and its "unnatural" culture, the Filipino people had to give up their tribal origins and traditions.
