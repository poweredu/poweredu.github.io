                                            CASE STUDY In this case study we will consider a network administrator for a small, family-oriented video store. The store is not part of a chain of stores and has a very limited security budget. It has five machines for employees to use to check out movies and one server on which to keep centralized records. That server is in the manager’s office. The administrator takes the following security precautions: 1. Each machine is upgraded to Windows XP, with the personal firewall turned on. 2. Antivirus software was installed on all machines. 3. A tape backup is added to the server, and tapes are kept in a file cabinet in the manager’s office. 4. Internet access to employee machines is removed. Now consider these questions: 1. What did these actions accomplish? 2. What additional actions might you recommend?</a>

=Your family business, a fast-food franchise in a Quezon City mall, is creating another outlet in a new mall in Caloocan City. Case facts: The Caloocan City outlet has the same workforce requirement as the franchise in Quezon City: one (1) store supervisor (college graduate with two-year experience), two (2) store assistants (college graduates with one-year experience), and three (3) frontline staff (high school graduates with one-year experience). The workforce training, materials, and machinery requirements for the expansion will be provided by the franchisor. The money for the expansion is estimated at five (5) million pesos and will be provided by your family. The managers of the expansion will be from family members, who will provide and direct the day- to-day operations and service requirements of the business (finance, accounting, logistics, etc.).</a>

Antivirus software was installed on all machines. 3. A tape backup is added to the server, and tapes are kept in a file cabinet in the manager’s office. 4. Internet access to employee machines is removed. Now consider these questions: 1. What did these actions accomplish? 2. What additional actions might you recommend?</h2><br />

Her family wants you to increase the rate so that Marilyn is kept under and completely oblivious to her condition.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>increasing the morphine intake will only cause Marilyn to possibly die. That is why following prescription is important. The parents might just be too lazy to deal with Marilyn when she is suffering. Honestly, I do not see how I am related to the family nor the doctor, so I'll just respect whatever decision they make. Whether to overdose Marilyn with drugs or minimize her suffering (juuuust a little) with the right intake of morphine. If she dies, tleast she died high. lol. </p><p>Why don't ya'll just ask marilyn wth she wants? </p><br />
