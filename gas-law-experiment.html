A gas consists of molecules in constantmotion.2. Gasinfluence each other only by collision; they exert no otherforces on each other.3. All collisions between gas molecules are perfectly; all kineticenergy is conserved.4. The volume occupied by the molecules of a gas is negligibly small; majorityof theof the gas is empty space through which the gasmolecules are moving.Thus, the Kinetic Molecular Theory of gases provides a model to explainbehavioral (5)of gases.B. The relationship between volume and pressure at constant temperature oflaw which refers to a relationa gas is explained in (6)concerning the compression and expansion of a gas at constanttemperature. This empirical relation was formulated by the physicistRobert Boyle in 1662 which states that the volume of a given mass of gasheld at constant temperature is (7) ►proportional to itspressure. Boyle's Law experiments showed that when volume increases,the pressurethe pressure decreases; and if the volume (8)increases.​</a>

                                            LABORATORY ACTIVITY
Background: 
Air inside of an inflated balloon consists of individual gas molecules that are in constant motion. These molecules constantly collide with each other as well as with the walls of the balloon and these collisions are what we know as pressure. When the air in the balloon is heated, the gas molecules receive more energy and therefore start to move faster and start hitting the walls of the container with greater force. The result of this greater force is that the volume of the balloon expands. From this example we can see that volume, pressure, and temperature of a gas all have an effect on each other in a given system. Likewise, if we were to pump some more air molecules inside the balloon that would increase the number of collisions with the wall of the balloon, creating more pressure and that would cause the balloon to expand. Today we will directly see the relationship between different measurements of gas and use our data that we collect to graphically show this relationship. Purpose: To identify how pressure, volume, temperature, and the amount of gas are all related to each other and to show how we can graphically represent this relationship.

                            8. B. Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure5. In a laboratory experiment, 763 ml of gas is collected over water at 27 °C and 275 mmHg. The volume of H2 and water vapor measured 300 ml. Upon standing, the temperature. changed to 17 °C and the pressure to 750 mmHg. What is the resultant volume? 6. A volume of 25 ml of oxygen is collected over water. The water level inside the eudiometer is 55 mmHg higher than that of the outside, temperature is 25 °C, barometric reading is 725 mmHg. a. Convert the volume of the dry gas at STP. b. Convert the volume of that dry gas at STP if the water level inside the eudiometer is 18 mmHg lower than of the outside. 7. Oxygen gas occupies 500 ml and 20 °C and 760 mmHg. What volume will it occupy if it is collected over water at 30 °C and 750 mmHg. (water vapor pressure at 30 °C = 31.8 mmHg) 8. At STP, the sample of Nitrogen gas is collected over water at a volume at 10.2 L. Calculate the new pressure at a volume of 93.3 L and 45 °C?​</h2><br />
                        To solve for the resultant volume, we need to use Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure. The first step is to calculate the partial pressure of the dry gas by subtracting the vapor pressure of water from the total pressure:<br />Partial pressure of dry gas = total pressure - vapor pressure of water<br />Partial pressure of dry gas = 275 mmHg - 23.8 mmHg (vapor pressure of water at 27°C)<br />Partial pressure of dry gas = 251.2 mmHg<br /><br />Using the formula for the combined gas law, we can now calculate the resultant volume:<br /><br />(P1V1/T1) = (P2V2/T2)<br /><br />P1 = 251.2 mmHg<br />V1 = 763 mL - 300 mL = 463 mL (subtracting the volume of H2O vapor)<br />T1 = 27°C + 273 = 300 K<br />P2 = 750 mmHg<br />T2 = 17°C + 273 = 290 K<br /><br />V2 = (P1V1T2)/(T1P2)<br />V2 = (251.2 mmHg x 463 mL x 290 K)/(300 K x 750 mmHg)<br />V2 = 222.3 mL<br /><br />Therefore, the resultant volume is 222.3 mL.<br /><br />6a. To convert the volume of the dry gas at STP, we need to use the combined gas law again, this time setting the initial conditions at the experimental values and the final conditions at STP (0°C and 1 atm).<br /><br />(P1V1/T1) = (P2V2/T2)<br /><br />P1 = 725 mmHg + 55 mmHg = 780 mmHg<br />V1 = 25 mL<br />T1 = 25°C + 273 = 298 K<br />P2 = 1 atm<br />V2 = ?<br />T2 = 0°C + 273 = 273 K<br /><br />V2 = (P1V1T2)/(T1P2)<br />V2 = (780 mmHg x 25 mL x 273 K)/(298 K x 760 mmHg)<br />V2 = 19.95 mL<br /><br />Therefore, the volume of the dry gas at STP is 19.95 mL.<br /><br />6b. To convert the volume of the dry gas at STP with a different water level, we just need to use the same formula as before, but with the new pressure:<br /><br />P1 = 725 mmHg - 18 mmHg = 707 mmHg<br /><br />V2 = (P1V1T2)/(T1P2)<br />V2 = (707 mmHg x 25 mL x 273 K)/(298 K x 760 mmHg)<br />V2 = 18.09 mL<br /><br />Therefore, the volume of the dry gas at STP with a water level 18 mmHg lower than outside is 18.09 mL.<br /><br />7. To solve this problem, we can use Dalton's Law of Partial Pressure which states that the total pressure of a mixture of gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of each gas. We need to subtract the vapor pressure of water from the total pressure to get the pressure exerted by oxygen gas. Then, we can use the combined gas law to find the new volume.<br />First, we need to calculate the pressure exerted by oxygen gas:<br /><br />P(O2) = P(total) - P(H2O vapor)<br />P(O2) = 750 mmHg - 31.8 mmHg<br />P(O2) = 718.2 mmHg<br /><br />Next, we can use the combined gas law:<br /><br />(P1 x V1)/T1 = (P2 x V2)/T2<br /><br />where P1 = 718.2 mmHg, V1 = 500 ml, T1 = 20°C + 273 = 293 K, P2 = 750 mmHg, T2 = 30°C + 273 = 303 K<br /><br />Solving for V2:<br /><br />V2 = (P1 x V1 x T2)/(T1 x P2)<br />V2 = (718.2 mmHg x 500 ml x 303 K)/(293 K x 750 mmHg)<br />V2 = 415.7 ml<br /><br />Therefore, the oxygen gas will occupy 415.7 ml at 30°C and 750 mmHg when collected over water.<br /><br />8. This problem also involves the use of the combined gas law. We can use the given volume and temperature to calculate the initial pressure of the Nitrogen gas, and then use that pressure and the new volume and temperature to find the new pressure.<br />First, we can calculate the initial pressure of the Nitrogen gas:<br /><br />(P1 x V1)/T1 = (P2 x V2)/T2<br /><br />where P1 = ? (unknown), V1 = 10.2 L, T1 = 273 K, P2 = 1 atm (STP), V2 = 93.3 L, T2 = 45°C + 273 = 318 K<br /><br />Solving for P1:<br /><br />P1 = (P2 x V2 x T1)/(V1 x T2)<br />P1 = (1 atm x 93.3 L x 273 K)/(10.2 L x 318 K)<br />P1 = 0.735 atm<br /><br />Now, we can use the new volume and temperature to find the new pressure:<br /><br />(P1 x V1)/T1 = (P2 x V2)/T2<br /><br />where P1 = 0.735 atm, V1 = 10.2 L, T1 = 273 K, P2 = ? (unknown), V2 = 93.3 L, T2 = 45°C + 273 = 318 K<br /><br />Solving for P2:<br /><br />P2 = (P1 x V1 x T2)/(V2 x T1)<br />P2 = (0.735 atm x 10.2 L x 318 K)/(93.3 L x 273 K)<br />P2 = 1.50 atm<br /><br />Therefore, the new pressure of the Nitrogen gas is 1.50 atm at a volume of 93.3 L and a temperature of 45°C.<br />

Although their measurements were not precise by today’s standards, they were able to determine the mathematical relationships between pairs of these variables (e.g., pressure and temperature, pressure and volume) that hold for an ideal gas—a hypothetical construct that real gases approximate under certain conditions. Eventually, these individual laws were combined into a single equation—the ideal gas law—that relates gas quantities for gases and is quite accurate for low pressures and moderate temperatures. We will consider the key developments in individual relationships (for pedagogical reasons not quite in historical order), then put them together in the ideal gas law.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            23. LABORATORY ACTIVITY
Background: 
Air inside of an inflated balloon consists of individual gas molecules that are in constant motion. These molecules constantly collide with each other as well as with the walls of the balloon and these collisions are what we know as pressure. When the air in the balloon is heated, the gas molecules receive more energy and therefore start to move faster and start hitting the walls of the container with greater force. The result of this greater force is that the volume of the balloon expands. From this example we can see that volume, pressure, and temperature of a gas all have an effect on each other in a given system. Likewise, if we were to pump some more air molecules inside the balloon that would increase the number of collisions with the wall of the balloon, creating more pressure and that would cause the balloon to expand. Today we will directly see the relationship between different measurements of gas and use our data that we collect to graphically show this relationship. Purpose: To identify how pressure, volume, temperature, and the amount of gas are all related to each other and to show how we can graphically represent this relationship. 
Procedure: 
Go to the address below on the internet. http://ch301.cm.utexas.edu/simulations/js/idealgaslaw/ 
The screen will show a simulation of a sample of gas in a cylinder. Click on the picture at the center of the screen to get started. 
To measure the relationship between temperature and volume of a gas (Charles’s Law), this means you will not be varying the pressure in this experiment. Pressure should read the same in all trials. Vary the temperature five different times and read the resulting volume. Enter the data into an appropriate data table. 
To measure the relationship between pressure and volume of a gas (Boyle’s Law), this means you will not be varying the temperature in this experiment. Temperature should read the same in all trials. Vary the volume five different times and read the resulting pressure. Enter the data into an appropriate data table.
To measure the relationship between temperature and pressure of a gas (Gay-Lussac’s Law), this means you will not be varying the volume in this experiment. Volume should read the same in all trials. Vary the temperature five different times and read the resulting pressure. Enter the data into an appropriate data table.
Use Excel to generate graphs for each set of data. Remember to plot the independent and dependent variables on the correct axis, and to include all labels on your graph. 
Questions 
Using the data from the lab explain the relationship between temperature and volume; pressure and volume; and temperature and pressure. Also explain why this happens, making sure you reference information from KMT. 
1.Give a real-world example on where you can see all the above relationships take place in everyday life. Explain how your example fits the relationship shown in the experiments. 
2.Explain why it is dangerous to heat sealed containers. 
3.If you had a balloon at set pressure and set temperature. What would happen to the balloon if more air were added to it? This is called Avogadro’s law. Explain how this works.</h2><br />

His name was Melu, and when he sat on the clouds, which were his home, he occupied all the space above. His teeth were pure gold, and because he was very cleanly and continually rubbed himself with his hands, his skin became pure white. The dead skin which he rubbed off his body was placed on one side in a pile, and by and by this pile became so large that he was annoyed and set himself to consider what he could do with it.</p><p>2 Finally Melu decided to make the earth; so he worked very hard in putting the dead skin into shape, and when it was finished he was so pleased with it that he determined to make two beings like himself, though smaller, to live on it.</p><p>3 Taking the remnants of the material left after making the earth he fashioned two men, but just as they were all finished except their noses, Tau Tana from below the earth appeared and wanted to help him.</p><p>4 Melu did not wish any assistance, and a great argument ensued.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kayorama nano ha</p><br />
