Division of labor is an economic concept which states that gestures, signs,objects, signals, and words--help people understand that world.2. Rural areas often called "the country," have low population density andlarge amounts of undeveloped land. Usually, the difference between a rural areaand an urban area is clear.3. From a systems perspective, community is like a church, similar to a livingcreature, made up of different parts that represents individual functions, activities, eachoperating within specific boundaries to meet the needs of the community.4. Urban areas are still not fully developed, meaning there is a density ofhuman structures such as houses, commercial buildings, roads, bridges, and railways.5. Ferdinand Tönnies (1855- 1946) was a German sociologist. He was amajor contributor to sociological theory and field studies.6. The Four Perspectives are System, Social, Virtual and Individual Perspective.-7. "Urban area" can refer to towns, cities, and suburbs.B. Acts of charity have been performed anonymously when ben tors do notwish to be acknowledged.9. Anonymity typically refers to the state of an individual's personal identity.or personally identifiable information, being publicly unknown.10. Gemeinschaft often translated as community refers to groupings based ona feeling of togetherness.11. When two or more metropolitan areas grow until they divide, the result maybe known as a megalopolis.12. Wirth's liypothesis is that substantial decreases in size and density of acommunity's population result in the accentuation of these five qualities:13. Heterogeneily is the state or quality of being heterogeneous-consisting of different, distinguishable parts or elements.14. System perspective describes the social and political networks that connectindividuals, organizations, and its leaders,15. Today, individuals rely heavily on computer-mediated communication.​</a>

                        <p>The benefit of collaboration and cooperation shown in the situation is economic growth for both the home and host countries through the increase in remittances sent to the Philippines. The context of collaboration is exemplified in the local government of Pasig and its sectors working together to implement health protocols in markets and malls. The meaning of "gestalt" is "whole." Andrea's belief that countries that are relatively poorer than others do not have enough opportunities for migrant workers, resulting in a low influx of migrants to these countries, depicts the principle of similarity. The principle of continuity is depicted in the situation where the Philippines has sent migrant workers to the United States from when it was a colony until modern times, making remittances a steady source of financial resources for the country.</p><br />
