                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>A roast speech is a humorous speech or speech full of jokes in honor of someone.</p><p></p><p>My example of roast speech to a classmate:</p><p></p><p>Whenever I am sitting beside this person I always feel happy and nervous at the same time. Happy because he is such a genius and whenever I am having a hard time doing our activities he helps me understand it and nervous because after the teacher is tired of calling him to recite, of course the teacher would look for others to answer her questions and it would always end up to be me because I'm sitting beside this genius that's why I am visible. So maybe next time after doing the activities I need to go pee so the teacher won't call my name anymore. Or maybe I will just distance myself and cut ties with him.</p><p></p><p>(The roast speech that I made is only the body I'm just going to suggest some tips in doing the introduction and conclusion.)</p><p></p><p>So in the introduction you need to greet everyone or made an opening joke that describes your subject.</p><p></p><p>In the conclusion you need to tell your most funny and memorable punchline about the honoree.</p><p></p><p>#AnswerForTrees</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Experiencing speech anxiety is normal. Nearly everyone gets nervous when they have to give a speech or a presentation, even experienced speakers. The speakers that look relaxed and confident have simply learned how to handle their anxiety and use it to enhance their performance.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The audience wants you to succeed. Novice speakers commonly feel that the people in the audience are extremely critical and want them to fail. This is very rarely the case. Think about situations where you have been an audience member. Did you want the speaker to fail? Probably not, in fact we are usually quite supportive of speakers and may even feel bad for them if they stumble over a word or lose their train of thought. Most audiences you will address as a student are rooting for you.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Students don’t always want to go to class. They may have required classes that they find difficult or don’t enjoy, or they may feel overwhelmed by other commitments or feel tired if they have early morning classes. However, even if instructors allow a certain number of unexcused absences, you should aim to attend every class session. Class attendance enhances class performance in the following ways:</p><p></p><p>Class participation: If you don’t attend class, you can’t participate in class activities. Class activities are usually part of your final grade, and they can help you apply concepts you learn from lectures and reading assignments.</p><p>Class interaction: If you rely on learning on your own (by doing the reading assignments outside of class, for example), you’ll miss out on class discussions with fellow students. Your classmates will often have the same questions as you, so going to class enables you to learn from them and ask your instructor about topics you all find difficult.</p><p>Interaction with the instructor: There is a reason why classes are taught by instructors. Instructors specialize in the subjects they teach, and they can provide extra insight and perspective on the material you’re studying. Going to class gives you the chance to take notes and ask questions about the lectures. Also, the more you participate, the more your instructors will come to know you and be aware of any help or support you might need. This will make you feel more comfortable to approach them outside of class if you need advice or are struggling with the course material.</p><p>Increased learning: Even though you will typically spend more time on coursework outside of the classroom, this makes class sessions even more valuable. Typically, in-class time will be devoted to the most challenging or key concepts covered in your textbooks. It’s important to know what these are so you can master them—also they’re likely to show up on exams.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> Sana Po makatulong</p><p>pa brainlaist po ❤</p><br />

Moreover, this is the last time I am addressing this school, so it has to be something special.</p><p></p><p>Acknowledging the Teachers</p><p>First of all, I must acknowledge our teachers. Furthermore, I think I speak for all the students when I acknowledge the teachers. Dear teachers, you have been the source of our education and knowledge these last several years. Most noteworthy, teachers not only educate us, but they teach us about the lesson of life.</p><p></p><p>Our teachers, over the years, have made us able to compete with the world.  Furthermore, they are the symbol of our strength. Moreover, our teachers have been the support base for us students.</p><p></p><p>Our teachers’ have sometimes been harsh in the form of strict father figures. But think about this, they were harsh only for our benefit. So, I hope none of you will carry ill-feeling towards any of our teachers even for a moment. Above all, their strictness will turn out to be a blessing for us in the life to come.</p><p></p><p>Teachers, of course, are not always strict. Furthermore, they display their generosity when they are not angry. In fact, teachers can be as generous as our mothers. Furthermore, even in their moment of anger, they never for a moment think badly for us, but only have our best interests in mind.</p><p></p><p>This day we should remember our teachers and be grateful to them. I thank the teachers for their immense hard work into making us better human. Words can never do justice to the immense contribution you have made in our lives. Furthermore, we always acknowledge you and love you, dear teachers.</p><p></p><p>How can I not mention my lively classmates and students at this important moment. Furthermore, you have made my stay at this school a memorable experience. Furthermore, the unity among the students of this school is unsurpassable. There is something special about the unity of this school’s students.</p><p></p><p>Dear classmates, you have provided me with a wonderful and delightful experience. Furthermore, I will sorely miss the time away from our school students and I am sure this is a mutual feeling we all share.</p><p></p><p>Wise individuals say that childhood friendships tend to be the strongest. With this belief in mind, I hope that our friendship will continue forever. Thank you once again, my dear students and friends, for giving me the best years of my life.</p><br />
