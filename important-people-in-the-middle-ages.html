Global Migration
Migration is a key feature of our increasingly interconnected world. It has also become a
flashpoint for debate in many countries, which underscores the importance of understanding the
patterns of global migration and the economic impact that is created when people move across
the world’s borders. A new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), People on the
move: Global migration’s impact and opportunity, aims to fill this need.
Refugees might be the face of migration in the media, but 90 percent of the world’s 247 million
migrants have moved across borders voluntarily, usually for economic reasons. Voluntary
migration flows are typically gradual, placing less stress on logistics and on the social fabric of
destination countries than refugee flows. Most voluntary migrants are working-age adults, a
characteristic that helps raise the share of the population that is economically active in
destination countries.
By contrast, the remaining 10 percent are refugees and asylum seekers who have fled to another
country to escape conflict and persecution. Roughly half of the world’s 24 million refugees are in
the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting the dominant pattern of flight to a neighboring
country. But the recent surge of arrivals in Europe has focused the developed world’s attention
on this issue. A companion report, Europe’s new refugees: A road map for better integration
outcomes, examines the challenges and opportunities confronting individual countries
While some migrants travel long distances from their origin countries, most migration still
involves people moving to neighboring countries or to countries in the same part of the world
(exhibit). About half of all migrants globally have moved from developing to developed
countries—indeed, this is the fastest-growing type of movement. Almost two-thirds of the
world’s migrants reside in developed countries, where they often fill key occupational shortages.
From 2000 to 2014, immigrants contributed 40 to 80 percent of labor-force growth in major
destination countries.</a>

Global Migration
Migration is a key feature of our increasingly interconnected world. It has also become a
flashpoint for debate in many countries, which underscores the importance of understanding the
patterns of global migration and the economic impact that is created when people move across
the world’s borders. A new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), People on the
move: Global migration’s impact and opportunity, aims to fill this need.
Refugees might be the face of migration in the media, but 90 percent of the world’s 247 million
migrants have moved across borders voluntarily, usually for economic reasons. Voluntary
migration flows are typically gradual, placing less stress on logistics and on the social fabric of
destination countries than refugee flows. Most voluntary migrants are working-age adults, a
characteristic that helps raise the share of the population that is economically active in
destination countries.
By contrast, the remaining 10 percent are refugees and asylum seekers who have fled to another
country to escape conflict and persecution. Roughly half of the world’s 24 million refugees are in
the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting the dominant pattern of flight to a neighboring
country. But the recent surge of arrivals in Europe has focused the developed world’s attention
on this issue. A companion report, Europe’s new refugees: A road map for better integration
outcomes, examines the challenges and opportunities confronting individual countries
While some migrants travel long distances from their origin countries, most migration still
involves people moving to neighboring countries or to countries in the same part of the world
(exhibit). About half of all migrants globally have moved from developing to developed
countries—indeed, this is the fastest-growing type of movement. Almost two-thirds of the
world’s migrants reside in developed countries, where they often fill key occupational shortages.

They should be able to drive because they might have woken up late and no one is home. Another reason is that on winter days it might be so cold that people could get bad frost bites.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Help!.. hindi ko makita yung tamang sagot</p><p></p><p>Congratulations for making it this far! You’re almost done. Before you proceed to your next lesson,</p><p></p><p>let us test your mastery. Today’s task is to read the following paragraphs and determine which pattern of</p><p></p><p>development in writing is used. Are you ready? Here are the paragraphs.</p><p></p><p>1. Caring for yourself during these times is also caring for others. When we are allowed to go </p><p></p><p>outside our houses, we should obey health practices. Some are skeptic about wearing masks. </p><p></p><p>Others are still in doubt when asked to wash hands often or use alcohol and sanitizer. There are </p><p></p><p>also people who question the need to maintain distance from each other in public areas. These </p><p></p><p>safety measures are set because they are proven to be helpful in preventing the spread of the </p><p></p><p>virus. They are not mere wishes to make our lives difficult. We are asked to do these health </p><p></p><p>protocols because we are still in danger with the rising number of COVID-19 cases. Be </p><p></p><p>responsible for yourself so that you will not be the reason for others to catch the virus. If you </p><p></p><p>care for your loved ones, you must take care of yourself first. You do not want to be the one </p><p></p><p>bringing the virus to your home.</p><p></p><p>2. The word quarantine is such a familiar one to almost everyone who are aware of the pandemic </p><p></p><p>today. According to the Merriam- Webster dictionary online, it is a noun that has several </p><p></p><p>meanings. It states that it is a period of 40 days. It may also be a term during which a ship </p><p></p><p>arriving in port and suspected of carrying contagious disease is held in isolation from the shore. </p><p></p><p>Also, it means a restraint upon the activities or communication of persons or the transport of </p><p></p><p>goods designed to prevent the spread of disease or pests. It is also defined as a state of enforced </p><p></p><p>isolation. For us, who have been in community quarantine for more or less three months, we</p><p></p><p>know that quarantine means staying at home and waiting for the situation to be better. It is a </p><p></p><p>condition wherein only those who have quarantine pass are allowed to go out for essential needs </p><p></p><p>of the family. For others, the concept quarantine may also be equated to “no work, no pay” </p><p></p><p>policy. Some may define it as something needed for people who are sick or those who came </p><p></p><p>from places with COVID-19 cases. On the other hand, some probably sees quarantine as </p><p></p><p>something that takes away their right to see family, relatives and friends. To sum it up, whatever </p><p></p><p>or however we understand quarantine, we need to follow it as a safety protocol since we are still </p><p></p><p>fighting this pandemic.</p><p></p><p>3. There are several similarities and differences between being a senior and junior high school </p><p></p><p>student. Being a senior and junior high school student, both require you to study hard to be able </p><p></p><p>to get desirable outputs and decent grades. Subjects are equally important to be given attention. </p><p></p><p>It’s just that some subject areas may be easier to deal with depending on different factors. The </p><p></p><p>subjects in senior high school (SHS) and junior high school (JHS) differ in a way that SHS </p><p></p><p>subjects are more specific areas that are deemed essential for the track and strand you chose </p><p></p><p>while in JHS, subjects are the general ones that we have since first grade, just increasing in </p><p></p><p>complexity. Another similarity is that when you enter SHS and JHS, you have to prepare </p><p></p><p>yourself to be a responsible part of the institution that you will enroll in. You should be ready to </p><p></p><p>follow the policy that the school implements. Being a “senior” high student doesn’t mean you </p><p></p><p>are superior or anything and being a “junior” high student doesn’t mean that you are under those </p><p></p><p>in the SHS. The difference comes when there may be slight changes in the way rules and </p><p></p><p>regulations are applied and the gravity of reprimands you may receive as you step up to higher </p><p></p><p>grade levels or as you encounter different situations. In general, whether there are similarity or </p><p></p><p>difference in being a Senior or Junior high school student, it’s is still up to you how you will </p><p></p><p>handle it.</p><br />
