                                            Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions:  1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example;  Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10. 5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.

                                            B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature.3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set.4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10.5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency.6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency.7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.​</a>

                                            A hotel reservation system is the way that people can make safe online reservations. The process is similar to booking through an online travel agency (OTA), but the hotel's booking engine connects to their own website so that the hotel doesn't have to pay any extra fees. Through the hotel reservation system software, guests can choose how long they will stay, the type of room they want, get add-ons, and pay securely online through a payment platform.
Suppose you are building a hotel reservation system for a 100-room hostel. Answer the following questions:
1. What are the product features that you would like to implement in an online hotel reservation system? You may create a list and short description of the following features.
2. What are the challenges when it comes to building this type of system?

                            5. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions:  1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example;  Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10. 5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.

                            8. B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10.5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete.PLEASE BE MINDFUL DON TUMAWAG ANSWER IF YOU DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER THANKYOU!!​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Step-by-step explanation:</strong></p><p>Let's say we want to create a frequency distribution table for the ages of a group of people attending a music festival. We collected the data on the ages of 100 people and we want to group the data into intervals of 5. Here's an example of how the frequency distribution table could look like:</p><p></p><p>Age Interval	Frequency</p><p>15-19	12</p><p>20-24	30</p><p>25-29	25</p><p>30-34	18</p><p>35-39	10</p><p>Total	100</p><p>In this example, we chose to group the data into intervals of 5 and the data ranges from 15 to 39. The frequency column indicates the number of people whose ages fall within each interval. For example, 12 people are between the ages of 15-19, 30 people are between the ages of 20-24, and so on. The last row of the table shows the total number of people, which should always be equal to the sum of the frequencies.</p><br />

Create a frequency distribution table for the standard deviation of Asian countries and use the method of computing measures of central tendency for ungrouped data to calculate the central tendency measures.B. Group gathered data on their chosen topic Instructions: 1. Choose a topic: The first step is you have to choose a topic that you are interested in and want to create a frequency distribution table for. The topic could be anything from sports to movies to books. But it is best to choose a topic where you can get numerical data related to industry. Example; Number of Employees and their Salary, Number of time spent in study and their academic performance (Grade). You are encouraged also to advocate a social issue and use that information in this activity. I f you're advocating for women's rights, you may gather data on the frequency of abuse experienced by women in different age groups etc. 2. Collect data: You should then collect data on their chosen topic. This could involve conducting a survey, researching online, or using data from a reliable source. The data collected should be numerical in nature. 3. Organize the data: Next, you should organize the data into a table. You should list the values of the data in one column and the corresponding frequency in another column. The frequency is the number of times a particular value occurs in the data set. 4. Determine the class intervals: Depending on the range of values in the data set, you should determine the class intervals. Class intervals are the ranges of values that are used to group the data in the frequency distribution table. For example, if the data set ranges from 1 to 100, you may choose to group the data into intervals of 10. 5. Group the data: Using the class intervals determined in step 4, you should group the data into the appropriate intervals. They should then count the number of values that fall within each interval to determine the frequency. 6. Create the frequency distribution table: Using the organized and grouped data, you should create a frequency distribution table. The table should have columns for the class intervals, the frequency, and possibly a column for cumulative frequency. 7. Check for accuracy: Finally, you should double-check their work to ensure that the frequency distribution table is accurate and complete. ​</h2><br />

                            23. A hotel reservation system is the way that people can make safe online reservations. The process is similar to booking through an online travel agency (OTA), but the hotel's booking engine connects to their own website so that the hotel doesn't have to pay any extra fees.
