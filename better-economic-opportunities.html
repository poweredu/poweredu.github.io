TheAtrength of his leadership wasmatched only by the power ofhis words, which still call on usto perfect those sacred idealsenshrined in our foundingdocuments"We have an opportunity to make America a better Nation,Dr. King said on the eve of his death. "I may not get there with you. Butwant you to know tonight that we, as people, will get to the promisedland." Though we have made great strides since the turbulent era of Dr.King's movement, his work and our journey remain unfinished. Onlywhen our children are free to pursue their full measure of successunhindered by the color of their skin, their gender, the faith in theirheart, the people they love, or the fortune of their birth will we havereached our destination,Today, we are closer to fulfilling America's promise of economicand social justice because we stand on the shoulders of giants like DrKing, yet our future progress will depend on how we prepare our nexgeneration of leaders. We must fortify their ladders of opportunity bcorrecting social injustice, breaking the cycle of poverty in strugglingcommunities, and reinvesting in our schools, Education can unlockchild's potential and remains our strongest weapon against injustice andinequality.Recognizing that our Nation has yet to reach Dr. King's promiseland is not an admission of defeat, but a call to action. In theschallenging times, too many Americans face limited opportunities, buour capacity to support each other remains limitless.

Global Migration
Migration is a key feature of our increasingly interconnected world. It has also become a
flashpoint for debate in many countries, which underscores the importance of understanding the
patterns of global migration and the economic impact that is created when people move across
the world’s borders. A new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), People on the
move: Global migration’s impact and opportunity, aims to fill this need.
Refugees might be the face of migration in the media, but 90 percent of the world’s 247 million
migrants have moved across borders voluntarily, usually for economic reasons. Voluntary
migration flows are typically gradual, placing less stress on logistics and on the social fabric of
destination countries than refugee flows. Most voluntary migrants are working-age adults, a
characteristic that helps raise the share of the population that is economically active in
destination countries.
By contrast, the remaining 10 percent are refugees and asylum seekers who have fled to another
country to escape conflict and persecution. Roughly half of the world’s 24 million refugees are in
the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting the dominant pattern of flight to a neighboring
country. But the recent surge of arrivals in Europe has focused the developed world’s attention
on this issue. A companion report, Europe’s new refugees: A road map for better integration
outcomes, examines the challenges and opportunities confronting individual countries
While some migrants travel long distances from their origin countries, most migration still
involves people moving to neighboring countries or to countries in the same part of the world
(exhibit). About half of all migrants globally have moved from developing to developed
countries—indeed, this is the fastest-growing type of movement. Almost two-thirds of the
world’s migrants reside in developed countries, where they often fill key occupational shortages.
From 2000 to 2014, immigrants contributed 40 to 80 percent of labor-force growth in major
destination countries.</a>

"I may not get there with you. Butwant you to know tonight that we, as people, will get to the promisedland." Though we have made great strides since the turbulent era of Dr.King's movement, his work and our journey remain unfinished.

We must fortify their ladders of opportunity bcorrecting social injustice, breaking the cycle of poverty in strugglingcommunities, and reinvesting in our schools, Education can unlockchild's potential and remains our strongest weapon against injustice andinequality.Recognizing that our Nation has yet to reach Dr. King's promiseland is not an admission of defeat, but a call to action.

Global Migration
Migration is a key feature of our increasingly interconnected world. It has also become a
flashpoint for debate in many countries, which underscores the importance of understanding the
patterns of global migration and the economic impact that is created when people move across
the world’s borders. A new report from the McKinsey Global Institute (MGI), People on the
move: Global migration’s impact and opportunity, aims to fill this need.
Refugees might be the face of migration in the media, but 90 percent of the world’s 247 million
migrants have moved across borders voluntarily, usually for economic reasons. Voluntary
migration flows are typically gradual, placing less stress on logistics and on the social fabric of
destination countries than refugee flows. Most voluntary migrants are working-age adults, a
characteristic that helps raise the share of the population that is economically active in
destination countries.
By contrast, the remaining 10 percent are refugees and asylum seekers who have fled to another
country to escape conflict and persecution. Roughly half of the world’s 24 million refugees are in
the Middle East and North Africa, reflecting the dominant pattern of flight to a neighboring
country. But the recent surge of arrivals in Europe has focused the developed world’s attention
on this issue. A companion report, Europe’s new refugees: A road map for better integration
outcomes, examines the challenges and opportunities confronting individual countries
While some migrants travel long distances from their origin countries, most migration still
involves people moving to neighboring countries or to countries in the same part of the world
(exhibit). About half of all migrants globally have moved from developing to developed
countries—indeed, this is the fastest-growing type of movement. Almost two-thirds of the
world’s migrants reside in developed countries, where they often fill key occupational shortages.
From 2000 to 2014, immigrants contributed 40 to 80 percent of labor-force growth in major
destination countries.</h2><br />

                        <p>The group will arrive in the <strong>Promised Land</strong>, according to Dr. King.</p><p>   <strong> Dr. King's</strong> steadfast commitment to racial equality, civil rights, and justice for all contributed to the speech's potency. Over 250,000 people joined him in his belief in the strength of his cause and the beauty of a brighter future. Any change you attempt to make without conviction is likely to fail.</p> On the eve of his passing, King declared, "We have a chance to make America a better country. "I might not accompany you there. But I want you to know this evening that our group will reach the Promised Land. This assertion is backed up by the passage "The particular liberty of a person rests on the common equality." Explanation: According to Martin Luther King, the United States still had a difficult time dealing with issues like racism and injustice.The notion of<strong> economic justice</strong> holds that a more just economy will prosper. The objective is to provide everyone with equal possibilities for success and to ensure that justice and prosperity coexist rather than conflict.<strong> Social justice</strong>, on the other hand, is fairness as it appears in society. Fairness in housing, employment, healthcare, and other areas are included. Four fundamental objectives—human rights, access, participation, and equity—are necessary for social justice.He urged the people of the United States to fight for a nation where everyone would enjoy equal rights. He would have seen that Americans are getting closer to turning this nation into the promised land of liberty and equality if he were still living.President Obama urged everyone to come together and support one another. The key is unity because there is no end to what we can do for one another. The president persuades the populace by urging them to keep an eye out for one another in both good and terrible times. Not only is it pertinent to our current circumstances in real life, but we also need to remember that speeches and lessons like these will still be relevant for future generations. We must band together in the present, when the pandemic is our major adversary. Lessening the transmission of bacteria and viruses can be accomplished by adhering to appropriate rules and regulations and by following appropriate health measures. This is only one straightforward strategy for unity.<p>Learn more about<strong> Dr. King's Speech</strong>: https://brainly.ph/question/8795503</p><p><strong>#SPJ5</strong></p><br />
