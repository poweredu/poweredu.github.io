We have Santa Cruzan which is which is being held in most of our country,Panagbenga Festival in Baguio,Sinulog Festival in Cebu and the River Festival in Bocaue ,Bulacan. ​An annual celebration of the Bocaue River festival is being held every first Sunday of July in Bocaue,Bulacan in respect to the Holy Cross,the Mahal na Poon ng Krus sa Wawa,which was found in the river in 1850. During the festival the replica of the holy cross is placed at the top of the decorated pagoda on a barge.Small boats accompanying it surround the pagoda.​According to the report,a skyrocket flying towards the pagoda caused the many people to react and forced them to move to one side of the barge. Many people onboard panicked upon hearing the noise of crackling timber. The pagoda collapsed and eventually sank to the riverbed. Based on the different testimonies ,the power generator of the pagoda was still operational when it sank.Many people were believed to be electrocuted as well.​</a>

Just like in the legend, if you have the fundamental of trust in your partner, then you are positive that your bearing will make it.  </p><p>
</p><p>When there is trust between you and your partner, constantly explaining yourself, your actions and decisions will be nonexistent. Furthermore, you both can have space and time when you need it without having to justify why you need it.  </p><p>
</p><p>
</p><p>A promise is will always be a promise. Remember, trust is built through a series of experiences shared with others. However, in the story, the wife hid her true identity, which, however, is wrong. If someone loves you, he/she will accept you for who you are and what kind of person you will be. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>To read and learn more about this topic, you may click the following links below : #BRAINLYFAST</p>Love and Trust : https://brainly.ph/question/1791055Trust Issues : https://brainly.ph/question/1453458<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Negro Speaks of River" is a poem written in 1920 by the American poet Langston Hughes. One of the key poems of a literary movement called the "Harlem Renaissance," "The Negro Speaks of River" traces black history from the beginning of human civilization to the present, encompassing both triumphs (like the construction of the Egyptian pyramids) and horrors (like American slavery). The poem argues that the black "soul" has incorporated all of this historical experience, and in the process has become "deep." The poem thus suggests that black cultural identity is continuous, that it stretches across the violence and displacement of slavery to connect with the past—and that black people have made vital, yet often neglected contributions to human civilization. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hehe nasa book ko po yan hehe</p><p></p><br />

During the festival the replica of the holy cross is placed at the top of the decorated pagoda on a barge.Small boats accompanying it surround the pagoda.​According to the report,a skyrocket flying towards the pagoda caused the many people to react and forced them to move to one side of the barge. Many people onboard panicked upon hearing the noise of crackling timber. The pagoda collapsed and eventually sank to the riverbed. Based on the different testimonies ,the power generator of the pagoda was still operational when it sank.Many people were believed to be electrocuted as well.​</h2><br />
