                            1. The Centipede by Rony Diaz</h2><br />
                        <p>WHEN I saw my sister, Delia, beating my dog with a stick, I felt hate heave like a caged, angry beast in my chest. Out in the sun, the hair of my sister glinted like metal and, in her brown dress, she looked like a sheathed dagger. Biryuk hugged the earth and screamed but I could not bound forward nor cry out to my sister. She had a weak heart and she must not be surprised. So I held myself, my throat swelled, and I felt hate rear and plunge in its cage of ribs.</p><p> </p><p>I WAS thirteen when my father first took me hunting. All through the summer of that year, I had tramped alone and unarmed the fields and forest around our farm. Then one afternoon in late July my father told me I could use his shotgun.</p><p>Beyond the ipil grove, in a grass field we spotted a covey of brown pigeons. In the open, they kept springing to the air and gliding away every time we were within range. But finally they dropped to the ground inside a wedge of guava trees. My father pressed my shoulder and I stopped. Then slowly, in a half-crouch, we advanced. The breeze rose lightly; the grass scuffed against my bare legs. My father stopped again. He knelt down and held my hand.</p><br />

                        <strong>The Centipede</strong><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When Eddie saw his sister, her demeanor and appearance seemed like a dagger completed with her brown dress. She was hitting his dog Biryuk with a stick, although hate and rage is fueling inside of Eddie while watching her sister he could not do anything for her sister has a weak heart. This scene was like of many others that had happened before.
</p><p>Characters in <strong>The Centipede</strong>:
</p>Eddie- young boy  Delia- Eddie’s sister
Berto- worker in their house
Biryuk- stray dog Eddie found
<p>He met the dog Biryuk when he and his father were out hunting for birds. With deemed patience they awaited for birds to take a leap to the sky before firing the shotgun. He was taught that hunters spit for good luck and do Eddie did. As they are waiting, a dog suddenly leaped towards the bird who were taking a long time to fly. Eddie fired his father’s shotgun and shot three with one shell.
</p><p>Eddie came to gather the shot birds, though the grass made it complicated to search. Biryuk pinpointed where the birds were and befriended Eddie. Eddie asked his father’s permission to keep Biryuk for the meantime, his father said that the dog will make a good pointer.
</p><p>Eddie followed Biryuk to where he was hiding and he noticed that Biryuk’s eye was pierced from the stick his sister used. With rage piling up more and more he screamed, he walked towards their house when Berto called Eddie to show him a large centipede that almost bit him. Eddie killed the centipede and kept its shell.
</p><p>He used <strong>the centipede</strong> to get back to his sister who was embroidering in the house. He tossed the white handkerchief towards his sister then she shrieked back. Her sister did see that it was Eddie who did it, as she struggles to keep her breathing she collapsed. And then Eddie panicked and insisted that<strong> the centipede</strong> was already dead.
</p><p>Eddie’s bad memory of his sister Delia:
</p>When Eddie came inside his sister’s playhouse and broke her doll, she grabbed a sapling and hit Eddie over and over.
She told Berto to kill Eddie’s monkey because it smiled at her.
She made Eddie’s pigeon house destroyed for kindling because it stank.
She burned his butterfly collection because she said it was attracting ants.

                        One day Eddie saw his sister beating his dog with a stick, he felt hate like a caged, angry beast in his chest. He could not cry to his sister because she had a weak heart. He recalled the things his sister did to him. <br /><br />For Eddie, his sister, Delia was the meanest creature he knew. He remembered when he was furiously hit by his sister when she learned that the leg of her doll was accidentally torn by him. <br /><br />Nothing Eddie did ever pleased her. Destroying willfully anything he liked had become a habit for her. She even told Berto to kill his monkey because it snickered at her one morning, while she was brushing her teeth. <br /><br />Eddie did not tell anything when she told Father that she did not like Eddie's pigeon house because it stank and he had to give away his pigeons and Berto had to chop the house into kindling wood. <br /><br />He learned how to hold himself because he knew they had to put up with her whims to keep her calm and quiet. But when she dumped his butterflies into a waste can and burned them in the backyard, he realized that she was spiting him. <br /><br />Eddie got a big centipede that Berto found under the stack he chopped. He made sure that it was dead and placed it in a white cloth. <br /><br />He unwrapped and threw it on the lap of his sister whom he hated so much. His sister collapsed. Her voice dragged off into a painstaking moan. <br /><br />Eddie was engulfed by a sudden feeling of pity and guilt. He cried kneeling before her, telling her that the centipede was dead<br /><br />:)<br />
