Role: You are a construction worker helping to build a house. Audience: The teacher and the class. Situation: You are helping your cousin build a house! The layout of the first floor is shown in the diagram below. You are helping him determine all the dimensions of his new home. Using the diagram above and your knowledge of polynomials find the following: 1. Write a polynomial that represents the length of the north side of the house. Then simplify the expression. 2. Your cousin said the length of the north side of the house is 9y +2y² -32. a. Is he correct? I b. How do you know? 3. Write a polynomial expression that represents the area of the kitchen. Then multiply to put the polynomial in standard form. Is the area an example of a trinomial, a binomial, or a monomial? 4. Write a polynomial expression that represents the area of the bedroom. Then multiply to put the polynomial in standard form. 5. For the area of the bedroom you just found, state the following: a. Variable: b. Coefficient(s): c. Constant Term: d. Degree: 6. Find the dimensions of the bathroom in terms of x. (Hint the west and east side of the house should be equal.) 7. You decided to add 2 more bedrooms to the West side of the house, but you still want the outside shape of the house to remain a rectangle. You must decide what dimensions you want the rooms to be, written in the form of a polynomial. Remember, the East and West sides of the house still need to be equal. a. Draw each room and label the dimensions. b. Find the area of each new room. c. Write a polynomial that represents the side of the house with the new rooms. Then simplify the expression. 8. You and your cousin decide that you want to put a deck on the East side of the house. Your cousin also wants to place 3 evenly spaced decorative pillars on the deck. How far apart do the posts need to be? Give your answer as a polynomial. 9. To build the walls on the two outside corners of the bedroom, your cousin wants to use sheets of dry wall that are each x in length.

                                            what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</a>

Role: You are a construction worker helping to build a house. Audience: The teacher and the class. Situation: You are helping your cousin build a house! The layout of the first floor is shown in the diagram below. You are helping him determine all the dimensions of his new home. Using the diagram above and your knowledge of polynomials find the following: 1. Write a polynomial that represents the length of the north side of the house. Then simplify the expression. 2. Your cousin said the length of the north side of the house is 9y +2y² -32. a. Is he correct? I b. How do you know? 3. Write a polynomial expression that represents the area of the kitchen. Then multiply to put the polynomial in standard form. Is the area an example of a trinomial, a binomial, or a monomial? 4. Write a polynomial expression that represents the area of the bedroom. Then multiply to put the polynomial in standard form. 5. For the area of the bedroom you just found, state the following: a. Variable: b. Coefficient(s): c. Constant Term: d. Degree: 6. Find the dimensions of the bathroom in terms of x. (Hint the west and east side of the house should be equal.) 7. You decided to add 2 more bedrooms to the West side of the house, but you still want the outside shape of the house to remain a rectangle. You must decide what dimensions you want the rooms to be, written in the form of a polynomial. Remember, the East and West sides of the house still need to be equal. a. Draw each room and label the dimensions. b. Find the area of each new room. c. Write a polynomial that represents the side of the house with the new rooms. Then simplify the expression. 8.

                            20. what is the main idea below.
- Many learners and teachers have established a wide range of
activities to support approaches to creativity and exploit the features of digital
technologies in processes such as: (a)developing ideas: supporting imaginative
conjecture, exploration and representation of ideas; (b) making connections:
supporting, challenging, informing and developing ideas by making
connections within formation, people, projects and resources; (c) creating and
making: engaging in making meanings though fashioning processes of
capture, manipulation and transformation of media; (d) collaboration:
working with others in immediate and dynamic ways to collaborate on
outcomes and construct shared knowledge; (e) communication and
evaluation: publishing and communicating outcomes for evaluation and
critique from a range of audiences. These activities are not always discrete or
sequential and there can be synchronicity in their expression and overlap of
applications for different purposes. Examples of such activities range from
using simulations and adventure games to explore the question ‘what would
happen if…?’, to publishing hypertext stories or constructing avatars to meet
and interact in three-dimensional, virtual worlds. This wealth of activity
illustrates how children and young people are able to use ICT to demonstrate
creative characteristics in the interaction between people and processes in
subject areas which are authentic, relevant and challenging</h2><br />
