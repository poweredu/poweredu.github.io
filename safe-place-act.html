                                            aleil Observation is something we often do instinctively. Observation helps us decide whether it's safe to cross the road and helps to determine if cupcakes are ready to come out of the oven. Observation is more than simply noticing something. It involvès perception (becoming aware of something by means of the senses) and the recognition of the subject's importance or significance. Standing on a roadside, our eyes tell us cars are quickly approaching. Prior knowledge warns us that stepping in front of a car is dangerous, so we wait until the road is clear. 290h Observation means an act of monitoring, something, i.e. objects, units, persons or anything else, by using senses.

Observation helps us decide whether it's safe to cross the road and helps to determine if cupcakes are ready to come out of the oven. Observation is more than simply noticing something. It involvès perception (becoming aware of something by means of the senses) and the recognition of the subject's importance or significance. Standing on a roadside, our eyes tell us cars are quickly approaching. Prior knowledge warns us that stepping in front of a car is dangerous, so we wait until the road is clear. 290h Observation means an act of monitoring, something, i.e. objects, units, persons or anything else, by using senses. In this process, the observer stays at the place of the survey and observes the objects under consideration and notes down the observations himself. Observation is defined as the primary source of data collection used in descriptive research. It is the most widely used method of acquiring information, in the field of behavioral sciences. We human beings use our senses to observe things that surround us this is also observation, but not scientific. Observation is said to be scientific when it serves the formulated purpose of research. It involves the collection and recording of data, events and objects in a systematic manner. Further, the data is subjected to checks and controls to ensure validity and reliability of data.Answer the question1.
