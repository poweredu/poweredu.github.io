Directions: Read the scientific investigation story below. Choose the letter that corresponds to your answer. 
A group of Grade 7- Rizal students came across one interesting vlog of their favorite social media influencer that touches the idea of giving music to plants. It is from this fascinating idea that they thought of conducting similar investigation as part of their requirements in their science subject. 
They started to read books, surf the internet and study researches on the effect of music to plant growth. Members from the group continued to formulate their respective hypotheses. They went on performing a simple experiment. 
The group selected two San Francisco plants of similar size planted on the same type of soil and kind of pots. Both plants were healthy. Each plant were placed in separate rooms with a window exposed to full sunlight and were watered with equal amounts every day. They measured the height of the plants. 
Once a day, they played classical music on room 1 for about one hour while leaving room 2 with no music played. Over a period of two weeks, they noted significant differences in each plant’s growth.

Assessment Directions: Read the selection carefully using different types of reading approach and write a close analysis and interpretation in the short story entitled “Stories of Nature from Japan” by Nitin Das. Write your answer in a separate sheet of paper. Title: Author: Introduction: Body: Conclusion: My Opinion:Stories of Nature from Japanby Nitin DasAt the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan was a dense forest that was home to many animals. A group of samurai warriors passing by decided to cut down the forest and make place for a training ground for martial arts. But a monk who lived in a secluded monastery nearby objected. Since the Samurai could not fight the monk, they decided on a simple competition to end the argument. The Samurai and the monk would race to the top of Mt. Fuji and the person who lost would have to leave.The samurai chose their fittest soldier and next morning both the monk and the soldier set off from the base of Mt Fuji to reach its summit. The samurai being young and energetic quickly took the lead. For a while the going was easy, but soon he found his path blocked by thick forests that cut into his flesh when he tried to pass. But the Samurai used his sword and cut his way up. He climbed hurriedly but his path was blocked by steep rocks. The samurai shed his heavy armour and sword and began to climb. He climbed for hours even though the way kept getting tougher. Soon he found himself hanging from a precipice with no way to go further. Many hours passed and by the next morning the Samurai’s strength was completely drained. He was about to let go of his hold and fall down to his death, when a hand reached out from above and pulled the Samurai up. The grateful Samurai was surprised to see that it was the monk who had saved his life. The Samurai was ashamed and he asked the monk how he had managed to climb up so fast. The monk explained that when you climb a mountain, you don’t make your own path, but you let the mountain show you the path.Moral: We need to learn to make our way around Nature, not against Nature​</a>

                                            Read the text and answer the questions that follow.Which one is better, a book or a movie? Some argue that one is better than the other, but it is still subject to debate. Both are good sources of entertainment and information, but because movies are shortened versions of books, some important details might not be included. Watching a movie will only take about two to three hours, while it will probably take you days before you can finish a whole book. Books can still be appealing to read even after 20 years. On the one hand, movies lose their appeal over time because of technological changes and advancements. However, movies are more visually appealing than books, but if it's the story you are after, both are on the same level. When you read books, you become more of a part of them; whereas you tend to be more passive when you watch movies. Compared with movies, books engage your imagination by letting you picture the characters’ faces, characters’ voices, and places. In conclusion, although books and movies share some similarities, it is apparent that readers have more to offer.Guide Questions:1. How did the writer introduce the main idea?2.

People in the other side. Based on this observation, they believed that the sum travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was the candy bar that made you feel better But there are other possible explanations for the observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you would have felt better without eating the candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you to avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to treat your first conclusion as one of several possible conclusions. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusion. The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion that is based on evidence Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask a question about your observation, such as, "What makes a sick stomach feel better? Step 2 is to state a possible answer to the question, or a hypothesis, such as, "A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better." Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat a candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test a hypothesis is what makes science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings—think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw a conclusion, and share it with the rest of the world. 1. What is this whole story mostly about? A. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking. B. The scientific method is a way of thinking that helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. C. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time. 2.

                                            The Scientific Method
 In ancient times, people tried to explain the world around them based on what they saw. People in ancient times saw that the sun came up from the side of the earth, moved across the sky, and went down on the other side. Based on this observation, they believe that the sun travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking.
 Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was a candy bar that made you feel better. But there are possible explanations for observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you have felt better without eating a candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time.
 The scientific method is a way of thinking helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusions.
 The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion based on evidence. Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask question about your observation, such as, “What makes a sick stomach feel better?” Step 2 is to state a possible answer to question, or a hypothesis, such as, “A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better. “Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test hypothesis is what makes a science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings-think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw conclusion-and share it with the rest of the world.

Directions: Read the scientific investigation story below. Choose the letter that corresponds to your answer. 
A group of Grade 7- Rizal students came across one interesting vlog of their favorite social media influencer that touches the idea of giving music to plants. It is from this fascinating idea that they thought of conducting similar investigation as part of their requirements in their science subject. 
They started to read books, surf the internet and study researches on the effect of music to plant growth. Members from the group continued to formulate their respective hypotheses. They went on performing a simple experiment. 
The group selected two San Francisco plants of similar size planted on the same type of soil and kind of pots. Both plants were healthy. Each plant were placed in separate rooms with a window exposed to full sunlight and were watered with equal amounts every day. They measured the height of the plants. 
Once a day, they played classical music on room 1 for about one hour while leaving room 2 with no music played. Over a period of two weeks, they noted significant differences in each plant’s growth.

1. What was the problem in the Grade 7-Rizal’s experiment?
a. Which San Francisco plant is taller? 
b. What kind of music should be given to plants? 
c. How long can plants grow? 
d. Does music make a plant grow faster? 
2. What do you think their hypothesis was? 
a. San Francisco plants grow because of sunlight. 
b. There is no change in the size of the San Francisco plants because it got equal amounts of water. 
c. Music can help plants grow faster. 
d. Plants need good soil to grow faster. 
3. How did they test their hypothesis? 
a. They placed two plants in one room and gave music to each. 
b. They planted the San Francisco in different pots and gave music to each. 
c. Same plants in similar soil and pots; both receive music. 
d. Same plant in similar soil and pots, with equal water and sunlight; only one plant received music. 
4. What do you think the group’s conclusion was? 
a. Plants grow with enough nutrients 
b. There is an increase on plants height when given music 
c. Music has no effect on plant growth 
d. Rich soil, water and sunlight are needed by plants 
5. Which is not a step in the scientific method?

Assessment Directions: Read the selection carefully using different types of reading approach and write a close analysis and interpretation in the short story entitled “Stories of Nature from Japan” by Nitin Das. Write your answer in a separate sheet of paper. Title: Author: Introduction: Body: Conclusion: My Opinion:Stories of Nature from Japanby Nitin DasAt the base of Mt. Fuji in Japan was a dense forest that was home to many animals. A group of samurai warriors passing by decided to cut down the forest and make place for a training ground for martial arts. But a monk who lived in a secluded monastery nearby objected. Since the Samurai could not fight the monk, they decided on a simple competition to end the argument. The Samurai and the monk would race to the top of Mt. Fuji and the person who lost would have to leave.The samurai chose their fittest soldier and next morning both the monk and the soldier set off from the base of Mt Fuji to reach its summit. The samurai being young and energetic quickly took the lead. For a while the going was easy, but soon he found his path blocked by thick forests that cut into his flesh when he tried to pass. But the Samurai used his sword and cut his way up. He climbed hurriedly but his path was blocked by steep rocks. The samurai shed his heavy armour and sword and began to climb. He climbed for hours even though the way kept getting tougher. Soon he found himself hanging from a precipice with no way to go further. Many hours passed and by the next morning the Samurai’s strength was completely drained. He was about to let go of his hold and fall down to his death, when a hand reached out from above and pulled the Samurai up. The grateful Samurai was surprised to see that it was the monk who had saved his life. The Samurai was ashamed and he asked the monk how he had managed to climb up so fast. The monk explained that when you climb a mountain, you don’t make your own path, but you let the mountain show you the path.Moral: We need to learn to make our way around Nature, not against Nature​</h2><br />

                            9. Read the text and answer the questions that follow.Which one is better, a book or a movie? Some argue that one is better than the other, but it is still subject to debate. Both are good sources of entertainment and information, but because movies are shortened versions of books, some important details might not be included. Watching a movie will only take about two to three hours, while it will probably take you days before you can finish a whole book. Books can still be appealing to read even after 20 years. On the one hand, movies lose their appeal over time because of technological changes and advancements. However, movies are more visually appealing than books, but if it's the story you are after, both are on the same level. When you read books, you become more of a part of them; whereas you tend to be more passive when you watch movies. Compared with movies, books engage your imagination by letting you picture the characters’ faces, characters’ voices, and places. In conclusion, although books and movies share some similarities, it is apparent that readers have more to offer.Guide Questions:1. How did the writer introduce the main idea?2.

                            17. The Scientific Method
 In ancient times, people tried to explain the world around them based on what they saw. People in ancient times saw that the sun came up from the side of the earth, moved across the sky, and went down on the other side. Based on this observation, they believe that the sun travels around the earth. Going directly from observation to conclusion is called non-scientific thinking.
 Here is an example of non-scientific thinking. Maybe you had a sick stomach, and ate a candy bar. An hour later, you observed that you felt much better. You might conclude that it was a candy bar that made you feel better. But there are possible explanations for observation. Maybe you had taken some medicine an hour earlier, and it took a while to work. Maybe enough time had passed, and you have felt better without eating a candy bar. Non-scientific thinking happens all the time.
 The scientific method is a way of thinking helps you to avoid drawing incorrect conclusions. It helps you avoid non-scientific thinking. It reminds you to gather evidence to support your conclusions.
 The five steps in the scientific method begin by questioning an observation, and end with a conclusion based on evidence. Step 1 in the scientific method is to ask question about your observation, such as, “What makes a sick stomach feel better?” Step 2 is to state a possible answer to question, or a hypothesis, such as, “A candy bar makes a sick stomach feel better. “Step 3 is to test the hypothesis. This can be done in many different ways. You could wait until you have a sick stomach again, eat candy bar, and see what happens. You could ask a lot of people if eating a candy bar had ever made a sick stomach feel better. Figuring out how to test hypothesis is what makes a science challenging. Step 4 is to think about the findings-think about what happened when you tested the hypothesis. Step 5 is to draw conclusion-and share it with the rest of the world.
