Mathematical system. Read the situation below and answer the questions that
follow.
A sari - sari store owner bought five different brands of detergent powder
namely A,B,C,D, and E. He bought 20 pieces for each brand. Even at a glance, he
can easily state which brand of detergent powder is the best seller. Now, each
powder claims that it would not irritate the skin after using it. In this case, the
store owner wants to test each brand to prove if the claim is true.
Questions:
1. What represents or describes the undefined terms in the situation?
2. What statement represents an axiom? Why?
3. What statement represents a theorem? Justify your answer.
4. Suppose a variant will cost 2x - 5 = -x + 10 pesos, prove that
each will cost Php5.00. Use two-column form.
5. Suppose A,B,C,D, and E represent the number of packs of
detergent sold for each brand, how much will the sari - sari store
owner earn in total if the cost is 5(A + B + C + D + E) pesos? Use
two - column form.</h2><br />
