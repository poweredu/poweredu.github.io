Have you ever wondered how those big ocean storms called hurricanes or typhoons get their names? Who decides to name a hurricane "Ann" or "Barbara" or "Bill"? The way
hurricanes and typhoons are named has changed over the years. At first, whether
forecasters described them by their positions in degrees of latitude or longitude. 
1.) ________ a typhoon used to be called "21.20 north, 157, 52 west". 2.) ________ this method was confusing because storms don't stay in the same place; 3) _______
people developed other ways to identify them. In the 60s, a weather forecaster in Australia used to name typhoons after politicians whom he disliked. For example, he could make weather forecasts such as "Typhoon Smith is on a very destructive path". 4.) ______
this caused criticism among the public, this trend continued to exist for quite
a long time. Later, during World War I, women's names began to be used like "Hurricane Betsy" or "Typhoon Alice" 5.)_______ during World War II, men's names became popular; a storm could be named "Fred" or "George". In short, we can say that the way hurricanes and typhoons are named has changed over the years and will undoubtedly change again.</a>

Have you ever wondered how those big ocean storms called hurricanes or typhoons get their names? Who decides to name a hurricane "Ann" or "Barbara" or "Bill"? The way
hurricanes and typhoons are named has changed over the years. At first, whether
forecasters described them by their positions in degrees of latitude or longitude. 
1.) ________ a typhoon used to be called "21.20 north, 157, 52 west". 2.) ________ this method was confusing because storms don't stay in the same place; 3) _______
people developed other ways to identify them. In the 60s, a weather forecaster in Australia used to name typhoons after politicians whom he disliked. For example, he could make weather forecasts such as "Typhoon Smith is on a very destructive path". 4.) ______
this caused criticism among the public, this trend continued to exist for quite
a long time. Later, during World War I, women's names began to be used like "Hurricane Betsy" or "Typhoon Alice" 5.)_______ during World War II, men's names became popular; a storm could be named "Fred" or "George". In short, we can say that the way hurricanes and typhoons are named has changed over the years and will undoubtedly change again.</h2><br />
