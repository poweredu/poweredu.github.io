                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Today tropical rainforests are disappearing from the face of the globe. Despite growing international concern, rainforests continue to be destroyed at a pace exceeding 80,000 acres (32,000 hectares) per day. Tropical cover now stands at 2 billion hectares (7.7 million sq miles), an area about the size of the United States plus China and representing around 13 percent of the world's land surface. Much of this remaining area has been impacted by human activities and no longer retains its full original biodiversity.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Deforestation of tropical rainforests has a global impact through species extinction, the loss of important ecosystem services and renewable resources, and the reduction of carbon sinks. However, this destruction can be slowed, stopped, and in some cases even reversed. Most people agree that the problem must be remedied, but the means are not as simple as fortifying fences around the remaining rainforests or banning the timber trade. Economic, political, and social pressures will not allow rainforests to persist if they are completely closed off from use and development.
</p><p>
</p><p>So, what should be done? The solution must be based on what is feasible, not overly idealistic, and depends on developing a conservation approach built on the principle of sustainable use and development of rainforests. Beyond the responsible development of rainforests, efforts to rehabilitate and restore degraded forest lands along with the establishment of protected areas are key to securing rainforests for the long-term benefits they can provide mankind.</p><br />

This movement is about empowering the citizens of our country to take action towards a better future.</strong><strong></strong><strong>Firstly, this force movement aims to educate Filipinos on their rights and responsibilities as citizens. By providing information and resources, we can empower people to be more active in their communities and have a say in the decisions that affect their lives.</strong><strong></strong><strong>Secondly, this movement will encourage Filipinos to be more involved in environmental and social issues. Through volunteering and community service, we can work towards a cleaner and more sustainable future for all.</strong><strong></strong><strong>Lastly, this movement will promote transparency and accountability in our government. By demanding honesty and integrity from our leaders, we can ensure that the needs and interests of Filipinos are being prioritized.</strong><strong></strong><strong>In conclusion, the force movement is not just beneficial for Filipinos, but it is necessary for our country's progress and development. I urge each and every one of you to support this movement and join us in our quest for a better future. Thank you.</strong><p></p><br />

*NAGDESISYON ANG PAARALAN NA ALISIN NA ANG PAGTUTURO NG KURSONG FILIPINO SA KURIKULUM.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang wikang Filipino ay ang ating pambansang wika. Karapat-dapat lamang na ito’y mahalin at ating gamit bilang isang mamamayang Pilipino. Ang pagtanggal sa asignatura ay maaring kontra sa pagiging makabayan. Ito ang ating wika na dapat natin ipinagmamalaki.Dagdag pa rito, ang asignatura ay importante para sa mga estudyanteng elementarya, highschool, at maging sa kolehiyo. Dikit na ito sa ating kultura kaya hindi ito makatarungan na tanggalin sapagkat sa wikang ito natin mas nauunawaan ang antas ng estado ng ating lipunan. Unti-unti naring namamatay ang ating wika’t pagkakakilanlan dahil sa pag-alis pa lamang sa asignaturang tumatalakay sa wika’y magsasanhi na ito ng dagok sa lipunan. Kung paaralan ay nag desisyon na alisin na ang pagtuturo ng kursong filipino,dapat na may gawin tayo para sa ating bayan o kinabukasan ng ating bansa. Kung napatupad na nang paaralan natin na aalisin ang asignaturang filipino.Unang-una na riyan ang pagkawala ng hanapbuhay ng napakaraming mga guro sa asignaturang ito na maaaring maging dahilan pa ng mas mataas na porsiyento ng kahirapan sa bansa dahil maaari silang magdusa at magdanas pa ng malalang kahirapan. Pangalawa, hindi pa ganoon kalawak ang nalalaman natin ukol sa pormal na wika at pananalita na siyang nararapat ngunit napalitan ng mga balbal at kolokyal na termino dahil sa paglaon ng panahon. Isa isahin natin ang nga dahilan o rason kung bakit dapat isali parin ang filipino sa kurikulum. Isang rason o dahilan kung bakit na hindi dapat alisin ang filipino sa kurikulum. Dahil ito ay ating pangunahing salita. Pangalawa dito tayo na ngunguha ng mga kaalaman o impormasyon dahil inaaral dito ang mga kultura nating pilipino o napag aaralan natin.Pangatlo ay ang salitang filipino na dapat na gamitin natin ang salitang filipino dahil para tayo ay magkakaintindihan. Pang-apat ay para maipakita ang pag ka pilipino natin at ang pag kakakilanlan natin. At dapat na gamitin natin ang filipino dahil tayo ay pilipino.
Naniniwala ako na napakahalaga ng wikang Filipino sa pagpapalalim ng mapanuri, malikhain, malaya, at mapagpalayang kakayahan ng mga mag-aaral at mamamayan.Subalit hindi lamang dito nagtatapos ang tunay na pagkakakilanlan natin, ang lahi at buong sangkatauhang Pilipino ay tiyak na wala kung wala rin ang ipinagmamalaki nitong wika, ang wikang Filipino.
