When we talk about music, Mindanao music is characterized by a highly subtle organization of melody and rhythm. is mainly homophonic, using a clear melody line over a subordinate chordal accompaniment, but counterpoint was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period. Melisma singing, song phrases, narrow singing, fluid singing, tremolo, strained voice, nasal enunciation, these are some of the characteristics of Islamic music. We have the chants and lullabies under vocal music; the richness of his/her kulintang and bamboo ensemble, the popular solo instruments like the kudyapi, all of which are strongly influenced by Islam and its traditions. Then we have the traditions of the Christians, which now has a very wide range of ancient and modern Catholic/church music, and those non-Christians / non-Muslim’s groups’, the Lumad’s folk songs. 1.

'We deserve to be choosy'
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque was the subject of criticism again for his remarks
on Monday, telling the public in Filipino during a briefing: "It is true that we all have
the right to good health but we cannot afford to be picky because there are so
many Filipinos who need to be vaccinated." He added that the government will not
force inoculation on those unwilling to receive the jabs.
For Leachon, the right to health enshrined in the Charter means Filipinos have the
right to be critical of the vaccines acquired by the government.
"Well, that is a very unfair statement coming from the spokesperson. Because
to me, and it is [written) in the Constitution that health is a basic right...
We
deserve to be choosy because we need to find the right vaccines for us based
on efficacy and safety," the health advocate told ANC's "Matter of Fact" on
Tuesday.
"And almost all the surveys are saying right now that there's vaccine hesitancy
because of the safety concerns of the vaccine And when there's a safety concern, 1
think you need to heed the call of the customers," he added.

We are met on a greatbattle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a finalresting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It isaltogether fitting and proper that we should do thisBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground.

                                            Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny.

My name is Aprille Arrivado, your chairman for today’s panel discussion. It is an honor both to participate in this event with our guests and to welcome you all. As we all know, our new normal today is somewhat strange to our usual way of living. In fact, one of the most affected systems in this time of crisis is our educational system. Everyone did not expect things to happen like this especially doing classes online, for face-to-face learning is strongly prohibited now to stop the spread of the coronavirus. We have invited you today to inform everyone especially the learners and their parents as well as our educators about online classes- how to do it effectively as a new means of teaching and learning and throughout the discussion, theywill identify the advantages and disadvantages of using this new method of teaching and learning.Thought-provoking Questions:1. _______________________________________2. _______________________________________3. _______________________________________4. _______________________________________5. _______________________________________​</a>

I'm not going to make this all long and formal, but I just wanted to thank everyone who came today to celebrate today with me, it means a lot! 20 years old...wow sounds weird to hear myself say it because I don't feel much different than last year but 20 sounds like a grown up so I guess I must be one! I have known many of you for so long and even though a lot of us are all going to school in different places now and have separated over the years, it's great that my birthday got you all back together for this one day! I want to thank my (family, parents, brothers, sisters), for making this party possible, for helping me so much in all the preparations, couldn't have done it without you guys! You had such great ideas and it sounded like such a big deal to organize in the beginning, but we all did our parts and it came together really nicely! So, that's it from me and I hope that you all really enjoy (tonight today) as much as I do! Thank you 1. Pick out the words that are used to connect the sentences 2.

It has affected everything and everyone. It has taken lives and is continuouslyinfecting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, around the world. To date, scientistsand health experts are still working together to discover a vaccine as a means to cureand to stop the spread of the aforesaid virus. Currently, the best ways for people not tocontract the virus are to observe proper hygiene, frequent hand washing, and use ofmask and alcohol anytime, anywhere, and everywhere they go. Equally important, is tostrengthen one’s immune system by eating healthy and nutritious food, having enoughrest and sleep, as well as doing healthy exercises. Furthermore, staying at home andstrictly observing physical distancing are also some of the best measures in avoiding thecontraction of the virus.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME1.)____________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER2.)___________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE3.)___________========================It’s Adverb Harvest Time!Read the text below and pick all the adverbs you can see, and then put them inthe column where they belong in the table provided below.Man and FaithBy Eneri S. OgeinamBowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilienceare again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one isexempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying7loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also, on a lighter note,it came as a great global equalizer.This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and severaluniversal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary.Our life, our wealth, and all possessions we have, including our own skills andknowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even themost powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything isunpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation,we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go, and our social connectionsand interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations, and all things we hold dearly,with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftlybecomes volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA worldwhere all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change.And the very question is, “Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on thegovernment, family, and friends for help?As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More thanever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faithto a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps usgoing¢ and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and hugechanges in this “new normal”. We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, wecontinue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive always. We learn how to look at thebrighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, ourfaith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life’s challenges. Therefore, let us holdonto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble norfear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of virusessuch as this COVID-19.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME4.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE5.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER6.)______________</a>

We had reached the space station. We had so much to do every day on our ship. Now there would be more people to help us. We would be on a collaborative team. When we moved into the space station, I felt great. There was so much more space. We would have real beds to sleep in. We would have better food. The six astronauts on the space station were happy to see us. They said, “We have been waiting for you.” We were glad to see them, too. That first night on the space station was great. We had good food. We had a good dinner. Then we were going to sleep. But one of the astronauts said, “We need to give you a job. Each person has to take turns staying awake. Here is the schedule.” I saw I was first. I would have to stay awake tonight. I had been awake and working for 20 hours. I became an astronaut so that I could travel in space. Now I’m here.

He added that the government will not force inoculation on those unwilling to receive the jabs. For Leachon, the right to health enshrined in the Charter means Filipinos have the right to to be critical critical of the vaccines acquired by the government."Well, that is a very unfair statement coming from the spokesperson. Because to me, and it is [written] in the Constitution that health is a basic right... We deserve to be choosy because we need to find the right vaccines for us based on efficacy and safety," the health advocate told ANC's "Matter of Fact" on Tuesday."And almost all the surveys are saying right now that there's vaccine hesitancy because of the safety concerns of the vaccine. And when there's a safety concern, think you need to heed the call of the customers," he added.​</a>

When we talk about music, Mindanao music is characterized by a highly subtle organization of melody and rhythm. is mainly homophonic, using a clear melody line over a subordinate chordal accompaniment, but counterpoint was by no means forgotten, especially later in the period. Melisma singing, song phrases, narrow singing, fluid singing, tremolo, strained voice, nasal enunciation, these are some of the characteristics of Islamic music. We have the chants and lullabies under vocal music; the richness of his/her kulintang and bamboo ensemble, the popular solo instruments like the kudyapi, all of which are strongly influenced by Islam and its traditions. Then we have the traditions of the Christians, which now has a very wide range of ancient and modern Catholic/church music, and those non-Christians / non-Muslim’s groups’, the Lumad’s folk songs. 1.

Pretend that you are a blogger. Study the passage below and write your personal point
of view in the form of a blog on the topic.
'We deserve to be choosy'
Presidential spokesman Harry Roque was the subject of criticism again for his remarks
on Monday, telling the public in Filipino during a briefing: "It is true that we all have
the right to good health but we cannot afford to be picky because there are so
many Filipinos who need to be vaccinated." He added that the government will not
force inoculation on those unwilling to receive the jabs.
For Leachon, the right to health enshrined in the Charter means Filipinos have the
right to be critical of the vaccines acquired by the government.
"Well, that is a very unfair statement coming from the spokesperson. Because
to me, and it is [written) in the Constitution that health is a basic right...
We
deserve to be choosy because we need to find the right vaccines for us based
on efficacy and safety," the health advocate told ANC's "Matter of Fact" on
Tuesday.
"And almost all the surveys are saying right now that there's vaccine hesitancy
because of the safety concerns of the vaccine And when there's a safety concern, 1
think you need to heed the call of the customers," he added.

We are met on a greatbattle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a finalresting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live. It isaltogether fitting and proper that we should do thisBut, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate - we can not consecrate -- we cannot hallow -- this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, haveconsecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract. The world will little nate,nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. Itis for us the living, rather to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which theywho fought here have thus far so nobly advanced.

                            11. Trust thyself: every heart vibrates to that iron string. Accept the place the divine providence has found for you, the society of your contemporaries, the connection of events. Great men have always done so, and confided themselves childlike to the genius of their age, betraying their perception that the absolutely trustworthy was seated at their heart, working through their hands, predominating in all their being. And we are now men, and must accept in the highest mind the same transcendent destiny.

                        <p> This excerpt from 'Self-reliance' by Ralph Waldo Emerson encourages individuals to trust in themselves and accept the situations they find themselves in. Moreover, he emphasizes the importance of connecting with their age, their society, and the divine providence that governs all things. He suggest that greatness is achieved by those who have the courage to accept and trust in the truth that resides in their hearts, which guides the actions they take. In other words, Emerson expects people to have faith in themselves, to be open to the guidance of the divine influence that exists in the world, and to accept the circumstances they find themselves in, so they can achieve greatness in life.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice. Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksand of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood. "1. If social injustice had not existed, what would probably the experiences of his people? 2. What could possibly happen if their efforts to achieve democracy would generate physical violence in the process?" I say to you today, my friends, though, even though we face the difficulties of to- day and tomorrow, I still have a dream. It is a dream deeply rooted in the Ameri- can dream. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up, live out the true meaning of its creed. "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal." 3. If you were given the chance to talk to King after his speech, what would you tell or ask him? 4. If you were King, would you dream the same thing for your country? Why or why not?" When we allow freedom ring - when we let it ring from every city and every ham- let, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, we will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual,Free at last!

                        The African-American community would be able to exercise their rights and live lives that are not under discrimination and threat. They would be able to contribute greater to society because they are not being inhibited by hate and stigma from the community. The<strong> African - American culture </strong>would have an earlier role in shaping the American countryThen Dr. Kng’s speeches would have been considered a failure, because Dr. King <strong>envisioned</strong> a future where there are no prejudices, not only towards his own race but to all races. If this would result in violence then everything that he would have fought for would be for naught because enacting violence in the name of freedom would only further the cycle of hate that he wished to stop.I would like to ask him how he was able to do it to forego violence in exchange for a better way, a peaceful way of demonstration. I would ask him for advice and how he was able to be brave and stand up for what is right. I would ask for stories to inspire me and motivate me to become a better person in a world that is broken and hated. Given the chance and the background, yes I would dream the same dream. Knowing what the African - American community has been through and currently going thru, I think I would also dream of a better country for my people and all the other people residing in our country. I would dream of a society no longer gripped and overcome with hate and prejudice but a country of inclusion and equity.

I want to thank my (family, parents, brothers, sisters), for making this party possible, for helping me so much in all the preparations, couldn't have done it without you guys! You had such great ideas and it sounded like such a big deal to organize in the beginning, but we all did our parts and it came together really nicely!

It has affected everything and everyone. It has taken lives and is continuouslyinfecting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, around the world. To date, scientistsand health experts are still working together to discover a vaccine as a means to cureand to stop the spread of the aforesaid virus. Currently, the best ways for people not tocontract the virus are to observe proper hygiene, frequent hand washing, and use ofmask and alcohol anytime, anywhere, and everywhere they go. Equally important, is tostrengthen one’s immune system by eating healthy and nutritious food, having enoughrest and sleep, as well as doing healthy exercises. Furthermore, staying at home andstrictly observing physical distancing are also some of the best measures in avoiding thecontraction of the virus.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME1.)____________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER2.)___________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE3.)___________========================It’s Adverb Harvest Time!Read the text below and pick all the adverbs you can see, and then put them inthe column where they belong in the table provided below.Man and FaithBy Eneri S. OgeinamBowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilienceare again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one isexempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying7loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also, on a lighter note,it came as a great global equalizer.This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and severaluniversal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary.Our life, our wealth, and all possessions we have, including our own skills andknowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even themost powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything isunpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation,we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go, and our social connectionsand interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations, and all things we hold dearly,with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftlybecomes volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA worldwhere all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change.And the very question is, “Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on thegovernment, family, and friends for help?As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More thanever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faithto a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps usgoing¢ and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and hugechanges in this “new normal”. We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, wecontinue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive always. We learn how to look at thebrighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, ourfaith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life’s challenges. Therefore, let us holdonto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble norfear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of virusessuch as this COVID-19.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME4.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE5.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER6.)______________</h2><br />

The six astronauts on the space station were happy to see us. They said, “We have been waiting for you.” We were glad to see them, too. That first night on the space station was great. We had good food. We had a good dinner. Then we were going to sleep. But one of the astronauts said, “We need to give you a job. Each person has to take turns staying awake. Here is the schedule.” I saw I was first. I would have to stay awake tonight. I had been awake and working for 20 hours. I became an astronaut so that I could travel in space. Now I’m here. It is hard work. It’s even more challenging than I expected. 1.

                            30.  'We deserve to be choosy' Presidential spokesman Harry Roque was the subject of criticism again for his remarks on Monday, telling the public in Filipino during a briefing: "It is true that we all have the right to good health but we cannot afford to be picky because there are so many Filipinos who need to be vaccinated." He added that the government will not force inoculation on those unwilling to receive the jabs. For Leachon, the right to health enshrined in the Charter means Filipinos have the right to to be critical critical of the vaccines acquired by the government."Well, that is a very unfair statement coming from the spokesperson. Because to me, and it is [written] in the Constitution that health is a basic right... We deserve to be choosy because we need to find the right vaccines for us based on efficacy and safety," the health advocate told ANC's "Matter of Fact" on Tuesday."And almost all the surveys are saying right now that there's vaccine hesitancy because of the safety concerns of the vaccine. And when there's a safety concern, think you need to heed the call of the customers," he added.​</h2><br />
