                            5. who is keesh in the story of keesh</h2><br />
                        <p>Keesh was a thirteen-year-old boy who lived at the North Pole a long time ago. His father died of sruggling with a bear in order to keep the people in the village from starving. After that, Keesh lived alone with his mother. One council Keesh complained about unfair treatment, but other people laughed at him. Therefore, he decided to hunt by himself. Later on, Keesh used his brain to kill many bears and divided them fairly. In the end, Keesh rose to power and became the leader of his people. Keesh is the major character of this story. He appears throughout the story. He is a round character, we can prove that from the beginning of the story and the ending. At the beginning he is a young boy who is innocence, but at the end of the story he becomes a brave man who is respected by the others. He is protagonist character. He has an important role and he is the central figure in the story.</p><p>The Story of Keesh is about a man who "exercised headcraft and not witchcraft, and rose from the meanest IGLOO to be head man of his village." London's story was published in 1907.</p><p>An illustration for the story The Story of Keesh by the author Jack London</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>KEESH lived long ago on the rim of the polar sea, was head man of his village through many and prosperous years, and died full of honors with his name on the lips of men. So long ago did he live that only the old men remember his name, his name and the tale, which they got from the old men before them, and which the old men to come will tell to their children and their children's children down to the end of time. And the winter darkness, when the north gales make their long sweep across the ice-pack, and the air is filled with flying white, and no man may venture forth, is the chosen time for the telling of how Keesh, from the poorest IGLOO in the village, rose to power and place over them all.</p><p></p><p>He was a bright boy, so the tale runs, healthy and strong, and he had seen thirteen suns, in their way of reckoning time. For each winter the sun leaves the land in darkness, and the next year a new sun returns so that they may be warm again and look upon one another's faces. The father of Keesh had been a very brave man, but he had met his death in a time of famine, when he sought to save the lives of his people by taking the life of a great polar bear. In his eagerness he came to close grapples with the bear, and his bones were crushed; but the bear had much meat on him and the people were saved. Keesh was his only son, and after that Keesh lived alone with his mother. But the people are prone to forget, and they forgot the deed of his father; and he being but a boy, and his mother only a woman, they, too, were swiftly forgotten, and ere long came to live in the meanest of all the IGLOOS.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story of Keesh is a short story which was written by Jack London that was first published in January of 1904. Keesh was the son of a great huntsman, who was well known and respected in his tribe. Unfortunately, Keesh’s father died when Keesh was very young. As is often the case, the legendary exploits of Keesh’s father was forgotten with time. After many years, the child grows to be thirteen. Inspired by tales of his father’s skills as a hunter, and emboldened by his self-confidence and the lackluster amount of food being gathered by the tribe, he addressed the village elders in the Igloo of the tribe’s chief. A child addressing the tribal elders was seen as precocious. Keesh declared that he would honor his father’s memory and became a great hunter, and bring back a wealth of meat for his people. He was scorned, and they allowed him to go off on his own. Many never expected to hear from him again. Four days later Keesh returned, with an enormous burden of freshly-killed meat over his shoulders. He explained that an entire polar bear’s carcass laid a day’s travel from the village. The villagers were stunned by this boy having endured the elements and succeeded in his quest, became suspicious. After several more hunting excursions on Keesh’s part, all alone and all resulting in enormous amounts of meat for the tribe, the villagers begin whispering that Keesh is undoubtedly practicing witchcraft. However, they had no choice but to be loyal to this manchild, as he had begun to provide them all with bounteous food. Keesh had the appreciative villagers construct for him an enormous Igloo, rivaling that of the chief. After more speculation and Inuendo as to the source of Keesh’s hunting prowess, it was decided to send two scouts to follow him on a hunting exhibition. They returned several days later, having been successful in trailing Keesh to his kill, an enormous (and dangerous) polar bear. They told a tale that the tribal council simply couldn’t believe. Upon his return, the tribe gathered in Keesh’s igloo to accuse him of witchcraft. He answered their charges well. Keesh explained the source of his hunting success. He explained why the two scouts sent to follow him observed him striding up to the bear, enraging it, and convincing it to follow him. He explained why the scouts witnessed his leaving small round balls of food on the ice for the bear, and why the bear soon became ill, and deranged. He explained how he was then able to spear the bear without endangering himself.</p><p><strong>The story of Keesh is a short story which was written by Jack London that was first published in January of 1904.

                            17. does literary technique strengthen the story of keesh​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Yes, literary techniques can certainly strengthen the story of "Keesh". The short story "Keesh" by Jack London tells the tale of a young Eskimo boy who becomes a successful hunter and leader in his community through his intelligence and cunning.</p><p></p><p>One literary technique used in the story is foreshadowing. The opening paragraph of the story foreshadows Keesh's eventual success as a hunter and leader by describing how the other members of his tribe underestimate him and treat him poorly. This creates a sense of anticipation and sets up the reader to expect a surprising outcome.</p><p></p><p>Another literary technique used in the story is imagery. The descriptions of the harsh, frozen landscape of the Arctic create a vivid and atmospheric setting that adds to the story's overall impact.</p><p></p><p>The use of symbolism is also apparent in the story, such as the symbolism of the wolf pack, which Keesh observes and learns from in order to become a successful hunter and leader.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the author's use of dialogue, particularly in the exchanges between Keesh and his father, helps to develop the characters and the themes of the story.</p><p></p><p>All of these literary techniques work together to create a compelling and impactful story that highlights the power of intelligence and resourcefulness in the face of adversity.</p><br />

It showcases the importance of intelligence and problem-solving skills, and how they can help a person overcome even the most challenging situations.</p><p></p><p>Literary devices: The story employs various literary devices such as metaphor, personification, and foreshadowing. For example, the use of the metaphor "a spark of knowledge" to describe Keesh's intelligence highlights the importance of knowledge and learning.</p><p></p><p>Literary techniques: The use of foreshadowing and suspense builds tension and keeps the reader engaged throughout the story. It also helps to emphasize the central themes of the story and the challenges faced by the characters.</p><p></p><p>Ending of the story: The ending of the story is satisfying and brings closure to Keesh's journey. It highlights the importance of intelligence and cunning in overcoming challenges and making a difference in the world.

                        I think his motivation in the story was to prove his capabilities that he can hunt the ravish polar bears in their village and prove that despite being young , he has the strength to fight in par with the adults and elder hunters . He simply wants to follow the footsteps of his father which was long forgotten by the villagers . He wants to prove his worth as a hunter to the adults and elders who tried to ridicule him for having such a big goal for a young boy .<br />

                        The story of Keesh is A short story which was written by Jack London that was first published in January of 1904. Keesh was the son of a great huntsman, who was well known and respected in his tribe. Unfortunately, Keesh’s father died when Keesh was very young. As is often the case, the legendary exploits of Keesh’s father was forgotten with time. After many years, the child grows to be thirteen. Inspired by tales of his father’s skills as a hunter, and emboldened by his self-confidence and the lackluster amount of food being gathered by the tribe, he addressed the village elders in the Igloo of the tribe’s chief. A child addressing the tribal elders was seen as precocious. Keesh declared that he would honor his father’s memory and became a great hunter, and bring back a wealth of meat for his people. He was scorned, and they allowed him to go off on his own. Many never expected to hear from him again. Four days later Keesh returned, with an enormous burden of freshly-killed meat over his shoulders. He explained that an entire polar bear’s carcass laid a day’s travel from the village. The villagers were stunned by this boy having endured the elements and succeeded in his quest, became suspicious. After several more hunting excursions on Keesh’s part, all alone and all resulting in enormous amounts of meat for the tribe, the villagers begin whispering that Keesh is undoubtedly practicing witchcraft. However, they had no choice but to be loyal to this manchild, as he had begun to provide them all with bounteous food. Keesh had the appreciative villagers construct for him an enormous Igloo, rivaling that of the chief. After more speculation and Inuendo as to the source of Keesh’s hunting prowess, it was decided to send two scouts to follow him on a hunting exhibition. They returned several days later, having been successful in trailing Keesh to his kill, an enormous (and dangerous) polar bear. They told a tale that the tribal council simply couldn’t believe. Upon his return, the tribe gathered in Keesh’s igloo to accuse him of witchcraft. He answered their charges well. Keesh explained the source of his hunting success. He explained why the two scouts sent to follow him observed him striding up to the bear, enraging it, and convincing it to follow him. He explained why the scouts witnessed his leaving small round balls of food on the ice for the bear, and why the bear soon became ill, and deranged. He explained how he was then able to spear the bear without endangering himself.<br />
