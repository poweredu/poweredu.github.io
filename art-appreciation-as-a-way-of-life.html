                                            With the rise and prominence of the Shri-Visayan Empire in the 6th to the 13th centuries, political dominance by conquests and wars took place. By the series of wars , the men population was depleted. In the course of time, the women folks by necessity in the scarcity of available men, had to take the place of the men in the battlefield so that they came to develop the high art of warfare to preserve their political state.
About seven hundred years ago, when Pangasinan was a kingdom, there lived a famous woman ruler in that dominion. Young, beautiful and well-educated, Princess Urduja was reputed to be a good warrior who had personally led her soldiers to the battlefields. Her retinue consisted of women skilled in arms, in riding horses and with well-built and well-developed bodies, prodigious strengh and masculine physique dubbed as Kinalakian or Kalakian or Amazon.
To the Pangasinan court many a suitor came, seeking for the hand of fair Urduja. The Princess said to them, “I will marry only the man who can defeat me. My husband must be braver , stronger, and wiser than myself.” As no one qualified to her demands, she remained unmarried all her life. For no one wished to be beaten by a woman. When her mother died, she became the ruler of Pangasinan region. Her bravery and skill were known far and near. She ruled her people well and wisely. Like the famous Amazons of old, Princess Urduja was not only intelligent, beautiful, and dominant, but also the very personification of kindness and virtue. One of her policies was to introduce the best of other countries adapted to her own. She was a woman who was interested in foreign affairs for the good of her own kingdom. She liked to hear the tales about India, the Pepper Country.An Arab traveller, Ibn Batuta, on his way to china, stopped at her kingdom. According to her custom, she invited the ship’s crew to a banquet. The Arab refused to go because he could not eat their food since they were “infidels”. The princess was offended and summoned him. He was surprised at what his eyes witnessed and his ears heard. For the Princess was robed in her richest and best, decked with precious stones and surrounded by brave and loyal men and women. She talked to the visitor in Arabian. This alone proved that she was a Moslem, knew her Koran, and therefore knew Arabic, she told him: “You, Priest, I have had you brought here by my guards because, of all of your ship’s company, you alone scorned my invitation. You told your Captain that we, people of Northern Luzon are infidels, and that it would be against the prophets law for you, a holy man, to eat our food.”
“You behold about me, seated around my throne, the elderly ladies who are my counselors. Do their chairs of sandal-wood, does my silk canopied and gold plated throne, suggest the court of a barbarous people?”
“I greeted you with the usual salutations of courtesy in the Turkish tongue, and had one of my attendants fetch ink and paper so I could write for you in Arabic characters that you recognized as the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Are such tokens of culture common among barbarians?”
When my father Dalisay, the aged king by whose name you call his kingdom, was a much younger man, there visited here a priest of another faith from far distant Europe. But he did not shun novelty in food as you do. The sago trees that produce flour, interest him, he admired the sugar-giving buri palms, and liked our coconut wine. And I hope you will appreciate the cordial pickles and preserves which, with some other gifts for your acceptance in remembrance of the land of Dalisay, I have had sent to your ship.”

                                            Native Footsteps
Edilberto A. Ochea
Let the spirit fly on the old path trodden,
Talikala of yesterday patched footprints;
Footsteps that build personality,
Footsteps that gave color to our Filipinoness;
Rich cultural way of life has opened the eyes,
In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;
The brand of the native brown is the belief in the Creator,
Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;

                            7. With the rise and prominence of the Shri-Visayan Empire in the 6th to the 13th centuries, political dominance by conquests and wars took place. By the series of wars , the men population was depleted. In the course of time, the women folks by necessity in the scarcity of available men, had to take the place of the men in the battlefield so that they came to develop the high art of warfare to preserve their political state.
About seven hundred years ago, when Pangasinan was a kingdom, there lived a famous woman ruler in that dominion. Young, beautiful and well-educated, Princess Urduja was reputed to be a good warrior who had personally led her soldiers to the battlefields. Her retinue consisted of women skilled in arms, in riding horses and with well-built and well-developed bodies, prodigious strengh and masculine physique dubbed as Kinalakian or Kalakian or Amazon.
To the Pangasinan court many a suitor came, seeking for the hand of fair Urduja. The Princess said to them, “I will marry only the man who can defeat me. My husband must be braver , stronger, and wiser than myself.” As no one qualified to her demands, she remained unmarried all her life. For no one wished to be beaten by a woman. When her mother died, she became the ruler of Pangasinan region. Her bravery and skill were known far and near. She ruled her people well and wisely. Like the famous Amazons of old, Princess Urduja was not only intelligent, beautiful, and dominant, but also the very personification of kindness and virtue. One of her policies was to introduce the best of other countries adapted to her own. She was a woman who was interested in foreign affairs for the good of her own kingdom. She liked to hear the tales about India, the Pepper Country.An Arab traveller, Ibn Batuta, on his way to china, stopped at her kingdom. According to her custom, she invited the ship’s crew to a banquet. The Arab refused to go because he could not eat their food since they were “infidels”. The princess was offended and summoned him. He was surprised at what his eyes witnessed and his ears heard. For the Princess was robed in her richest and best, decked with precious stones and surrounded by brave and loyal men and women. She talked to the visitor in Arabian. This alone proved that she was a Moslem, knew her Koran, and therefore knew Arabic, she told him: “You, Priest, I have had you brought here by my guards because, of all of your ship’s company, you alone scorned my invitation. You told your Captain that we, people of Northern Luzon are infidels, and that it would be against the prophets law for you, a holy man, to eat our food.”
“You behold about me, seated around my throne, the elderly ladies who are my counselors. Do their chairs of sandal-wood, does my silk canopied and gold plated throne, suggest the court of a barbarous people?”
“I greeted you with the usual salutations of courtesy in the Turkish tongue, and had one of my attendants fetch ink and paper so I could write for you in Arabic characters that you recognized as the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Are such tokens of culture common among barbarians?”
When my father Dalisay, the aged king by whose name you call his kingdom, was a much younger man, there visited here a priest of another faith from far distant Europe. But he did not shun novelty in food as you do. The sago trees that produce flour, interest him, he admired the sugar-giving buri palms, and liked our coconut wine. And I hope you will appreciate the cordial pickles and preserves which, with some other gifts for your acceptance in remembrance of the land of Dalisay, I have had sent to your ship.”

In politics, the way of governing the native palms;
Rich in manners, dress and the body is decorated,
In governance and litigation is ‘the well-being of the elite race;

Respect for the spirits and souls in the environment roaming;
These and other parts of mother nature,
Besides only worshiped and danced;
Remains of the deceased are greatly appreciated,
Cleaning, dressing, and fertilizing;
They wore clothes woven with love and creative hands,
Adapted to the hot climate of the pearl land of the eastern homeland;
Lovers of the art of painting and decoration,
Indications of intellect, decency, and gentleness;
Called pintados by Spanish foreigners,
When the natives were seen tattooed all over the body;
Under the leadership of the datu in the branch,
Sultanates in the far south, sultanates guiding;
With management efficiency,
The elders are surrounded by wise and reliable elders;
Laws made for territorial order,
Patterns of justice and efficiency;
Unity is a trace in the way of interaction,
The friendship was confirmed by the ceremony of the covenant;
Violation of the law or any social wrongdoing,
In front of the public, the court presided over by the datu and wise men
old;
10
In the event that the decision is difficult for the judge,
Nature's trials will surely unfold;
Diving in a river infested with crocodiles is scary,
Or ‘taking a stone in boiling water’ is certainly terrifying;
But it must be passed in order to be saved from death,
In the belief that God will stand by and save the innocent but the culprit is
will be punished purely;
Rich culture and governance of the Filipino people,
Traces of the past precipitate in personality;
Footsteps on the shore of the chosen land,
Because Filipinoness is high when it is boasted;
