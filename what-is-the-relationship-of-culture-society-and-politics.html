                        <p>The relationship between a society and its politics is the same as that of a compass and a ship!</p><p>Let's understand what society is. To put simply, society is an organized group of persons associated together for religious, benevolent, cultural, scientific, political, patriotic, or other purposes. It is a body of individuals living as members of a community sharing a number of common interests, values and attitudes.</p><p>And politics is the play for power. Human beings in all societies reach out for some power, authority, prestige, recognition etc. This want for power and to be known results in mind games, diplomacy, smartness to acquire what humans desire. </p><p>Humans are by nature competitive and that gives rise to showcase ones worthiness to the rest of the fellows. This results in politics.</p><p>In today's time, where most societies are democracies, politics has risen allthemore. The person in power is considered to have more social backing which speaks for itself.</p><p>Apart from basic human tendencies there are other foundations of the relationship between society and politics. Each society is unique and represents certain ideas, affiliations and values. There is a constant need to enlarge these ideas for more popularity.</p><p>So our society and the politics we indulge in is a direct reflection of our religion, caste, class, upbringing, mentality etc.</p><p>The two are inseparable and can't be studied in isolation. </p><br />
