An interview with John Moe (writer, humorist,
and National Public Radio host ) on the
pandemic and mental health
The percentage of people reporting symptoms of
depression, and a disorder level of depression is way up,
John emphasizes, and this does not show signs of
decreasing anytime soon.
“There’s this concept I read about called the
bereavement multiplier, where for every person who dies
of COVID-19, there are on average nine people in their
immediate family who will be grieving. If you take that
number and multiply it times the number of people who
have died, you have millions of people feeling stuck,
missing work, and not functioning at their best.”
John thinks that trauma, which is “completely under-
recognized as a source for mental disorders” explains the
rapidly increasing numbers of people experiencing mental
illness during the pandemic. He believes this influx of new
cases will put a tremendous strain on a mental health
care system that is already ill-equipped to receive them
and tells us that “there are parts of the country where
there’s barely any health professionals for the number of
people who live there.”
Along with bringing much-needed awareness to this
problem, John feels that some sort of system needs to be
put into place to effectively treat the growing amount of
people experiencing mental illness. He feels this can only
happen when there is proper representation of mental
health professionals on the White House Council on
Coronavirus.

Case Study
 Maxwell Prime, a non-sectarian co-educational institution in Metro Manila is one of the top schools of choice in the Philippines. It is an educational institution known for providing quality education and creating an engaging learning environment. The institution has adapted to the environmental changes specifically the development of technology. Technological advancement has been maximized by the institution and used it as a leverage competing with other players in the education industry. Due to this, a lot of students became attracted to the Maxwell Prime which led the institution to record 6000 enrollees — the highest number of enrollees in 2016. This number became the standard of the institution which was consistently met in its years of operation. In the present environment, Maxwell Prime aims to meet the set number of enrollees.
 However, there is a 20% decrease in enrollees due to the pandemic. Potential students became afraid in engaging into a possible face-to-face class and had the need to self-isolate. There are also students that chose not to enroll because of the new learning set-up — Online Classes. All this happened due the public health crisis and have greatly affected the education industry.
 Due to lack of enrollees, Maxwell Prime needs to lay off teachers to keep the institution running. However, when the online class has started, the attrition rate of the employees increases too. Teachers are leaving because of different reasons such as lack of support, adjustment to the online environment, mental health concern, etc. This slowly causes a problem in the operations and productivity of the institution.</a>

This is where the speakers speaks from an outline that's researched and put together. 5. This one is a little bit like manuscript except from you literally memorized it word for word you. It is like manuscript without papers with you because you memorized it. 6. This is the most common type of delivery in college presentations. When speaking, you have meticulously researched, organized, and practiced your speech ahead of time but it SOUNDS TOTALLY NATURAL. 7. This type of speech according to delivery also has few drawbacks. Not the least of which is forgetting the speech altogether. This, also, is a type of delivery best left to professional and competitive public speakers. 8. This delivery has little or no preparation. This happens when you get called on to answer a question in a class, without the benefit of a lot of advanced planning. 9. This speech works to convince people to change in some way; they think, the way they do something, or to start doing something that they are not currently doing. 10.

He was just everywhere the tiny invisible beast he is that has devoured over 200,000 lives, bringing every breathing generation live in the new normal. After the World Health Organization announced the first case of the 2019 Coronavirus infectious Disease in December 2019, this nemesis only took three months in bringing crisis to the Philippines healthcare structure and paralyze various sectors of the country, and the humanity has no choice but conform to the norms that would save lives in this global pandemic.2. Physical distancing was one of the indorsed commands from the government where individuals have to maintain a distance of one meter from each other - a reason for the rise of digital learning through online classes i.. order to grant the students with the right education Understanding Digital Learning in the New Normal Through digital learning, education is brought to students' home. However, it is only considered to be amazingly great if one has good internet connection as only then a student can lax and do his tasks even in his pajamas. It is learning at any location in any time as long as the student has his own smart device.3. Diagnosing the Drawbacks in a state where learning follows no concrete schedule, digital learning seems to pose threats on the students' physical and mental health. Sleep deprivation. At most cases, online class requirements' submission deadline is usually due before 12 midnight and students are likely to get deprived of sleep, trying to finish the online tasks that they can just do in morning when under the traditional learning. Eyestrain. Reports from the WHO stated that spending an extended amount of time at a computer could cause eyestrain which involves eye, head and neck discomforts. Unhealthy lifestyle. There is minimal physical efforts during digital learning as gone are the days of walking in school and carrying piles of physical books. The Philippine Heart Center also mentioned that physical inactivity could cause high blood pressure. Muscle and joint injuries that is brought by excessive time spent sitting in front of the computer4. In the strong desire of flattening the curve, the humanity is being forced to embrace the new normal and go on with their lives. And as much as Filipino learners want to escape the type of learning that they are not used to, the only thing left for everyone is be responsible in these trying times. Today, COVID-19 is still unstoppable; and there was not yet a vaccine that was medically approved to tame it. It is just everywhere and it is the humanity's every move that will determine whether we are going to be successful in this battle against this tiny invisible beast.Source: Tiny Invisible BeastErika Jeigne Felipe, Jones Rural School Champion, NSPC 2020​</a>

An interview with John Moe (writer, humorist,
and National Public Radio host ) on the
pandemic and mental health
The percentage of people reporting symptoms of
depression, and a disorder level of depression is way up,
John emphasizes, and this does not show signs of
decreasing anytime soon.
“There’s this concept I read about called the
bereavement multiplier, where for every person who dies
of COVID-19, there are on average nine people in their
immediate family who will be grieving. If you take that
number and multiply it times the number of people who
have died, you have millions of people feeling stuck,
missing work, and not functioning at their best.”
John thinks that trauma, which is “completely under-
recognized as a source for mental disorders” explains the
rapidly increasing numbers of people experiencing mental
illness during the pandemic. He believes this influx of new
cases will put a tremendous strain on a mental health
care system that is already ill-equipped to receive them
and tells us that “there are parts of the country where
there’s barely any health professionals for the number of
people who live there.”
Along with bringing much-needed awareness to this
problem, John feels that some sort of system needs to be
put into place to effectively treat the growing amount of
people experiencing mental illness. He feels this can only
happen when there is proper representation of mental
health professionals on the White House Council on
Coronavirus.

Case Study
 Maxwell Prime, a non-sectarian co-educational institution in Metro Manila is one of the top schools of choice in the Philippines. It is an educational institution known for providing quality education and creating an engaging learning environment. The institution has adapted to the environmental changes specifically the development of technology. Technological advancement has been maximized by the institution and used it as a leverage competing with other players in the education industry. Due to this, a lot of students became attracted to the Maxwell Prime which led the institution to record 6000 enrollees — the highest number of enrollees in 2016. This number became the standard of the institution which was consistently met in its years of operation. In the present environment, Maxwell Prime aims to meet the set number of enrollees.
 However, there is a 20% decrease in enrollees due to the pandemic. Potential students became afraid in engaging into a possible face-to-face class and had the need to self-isolate. There are also students that chose not to enroll because of the new learning set-up — Online Classes. All this happened due the public health crisis and have greatly affected the education industry.
 Due to lack of enrollees, Maxwell Prime needs to lay off teachers to keep the institution running. However, when the online class has started, the attrition rate of the employees increases too. Teachers are leaving because of different reasons such as lack of support, adjustment to the online environment, mental health concern, etc. This slowly causes a problem in the operations and productivity of the institution.</h2><br />

This is the type of delivery used when you prepare your speech well in advance. It takes all of that research, organization, and outlining work and then uses it to WRITE OUT THE SPEECH. 2. This one is pretty straightforward. You write out your entire presentation and you read it. 3. This speech is recited from the memory. 4. This is where the speakers speaks from an outline that's researched and put together. 5. This one is a little bit like manuscript except from you literally memorized it word for word you. It is like manuscript without papers with you because you memorized it. 6. This is the most common type of delivery in college presentations. When speaking, you have meticulously researched, organized, and practiced your speech ahead of time but it SOUNDS TOTALLY NATURAL. 7. This type of speech according to delivery also has few drawbacks. Not the least of which is forgetting the speech altogether. This, also, is a type of delivery best left to professional and competitive public speakers. 8. This delivery has little or no preparation. This happens when you get called on to answer a question in a class, without the benefit of a lot of advanced planning. 9. This speech works to convince people to change in some way; they think, the way they do something, or to start doing something that they are not currently doing. 10.

He was just everywhere the tiny invisible beast he is that has devoured over 200,000 lives, bringing every breathing generation live in the new normal. After the World Health Organization announced the first case of the 2019 Coronavirus infectious Disease in December 2019, this nemesis only took three months in bringing crisis to the Philippines healthcare structure and paralyze various sectors of the country, and the humanity has no choice but conform to the norms that would save lives in this global pandemic.2. Physical distancing was one of the indorsed commands from the government where individuals have to maintain a distance of one meter from each other - a reason for the rise of digital learning through online classes i.. order to grant the students with the right education Understanding Digital Learning in the New Normal Through digital learning, education is brought to students' home. However, it is only considered to be amazingly great if one has good internet connection as only then a student can lax and do his tasks even in his pajamas. It is learning at any location in any time as long as the student has his own smart device.3. Diagnosing the Drawbacks in a state where learning follows no concrete schedule, digital learning seems to pose threats on the students' physical and mental health. Sleep deprivation. At most cases, online class requirements' submission deadline is usually due before 12 midnight and students are likely to get deprived of sleep, trying to finish the online tasks that they can just do in morning when under the traditional learning. Eyestrain. Reports from the WHO stated that spending an extended amount of time at a computer could cause eyestrain which involves eye, head and neck discomforts. Unhealthy lifestyle. There is minimal physical efforts during digital learning as gone are the days of walking in school and carrying piles of physical books. The Philippine Heart Center also mentioned that physical inactivity could cause high blood pressure. Muscle and joint injuries that is brought by excessive time spent sitting in front of the computer4. In the strong desire of flattening the curve, the humanity is being forced to embrace the new normal and go on with their lives. And as much as Filipino learners want to escape the type of learning that they are not used to, the only thing left for everyone is be responsible in these trying times. Today, COVID-19 is still unstoppable; and there was not yet a vaccine that was medically approved to tame it. It is just everywhere and it is the humanity's every move that will determine whether we are going to be successful in this battle against this tiny invisible beast.Source: Tiny Invisible BeastErika Jeigne Felipe, Jones Rural School Champion, NSPC 2020​</h2><br />
