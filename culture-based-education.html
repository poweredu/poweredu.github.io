                                            B Directions Compare and contrast how Cambodia and Myanmar preserve their respective cultures. Write your opinions consisting of an introduction, body, and conclusion similar with the text presented below. Cambodia and Myanmar both have rich cultures. However, due to globalization, it has become a challenge for both countries to preserve their cultures. This problem arose in Cambodia spectically after the Khmer Rouge. One way to bring the people back to their cultural roots is to revive the Cambodian arts, including their literature, music, and performing arts. Also, the state has established monuments and schools to educate the Cambodians on the field of arts. Myanmar also did the same in preserving their culture. However, the big challenge is preserving their cultural heritage. This is due to the fast urbanization of Myanmar. This is why the Myanmar government adapted the intang ble Cultural Heritage Convention of 2003 from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to preserve their cultural heritage such as monuments and cultural sites (Aspillaga 2013). Countries all over the world, including the Philippines have different ways in keeping their cultures alive. Culture serves as our identity as a nation. Therefore, it is of great importance that governments give priority to preserving one's culture. It is indeed the soul of a nation. 语 What is culture based on the given text? Why is culture considered as the soul of every nation? In the Philippines, can you name museums and local heritage sites that represent the culture of our country? As Filipinos, how should we preserve our culture like our Asian neighboring countries?​</a>

Do this activity on a separate one whole sheet of paper. There is a challenge posted to higher education. That is to attune its present educational goals, objectives, and mission-vision to the demands of a globalized world. Consequently, institutions, especially in the developing countries, have started to reconstruct their global dynamics of knowledge production through establishing linkage among institutions across nations. Generally, the common set of internalization of higher education highlights the importance of promoting cultural diversity and fostering intercultural understanding, respect, and tolerance among people (Turner and Robinson, 2007). These reiterations of what internationalization of higher education should emphasize are actually based on the profound belief that the cultural heritage of people is universal and humankind shares the bond off humanity and global citizenship in the process off advancement of knowledge (Wing, 2010)... Exploratory in nature, This paper aims to examine the key concepts on IHE. Specifically, this paper reviews articles which will shed light on the significant ideas, and proposes a preliminary framework of IHE in the Philippines. Source:Communica​</a>

                                            what is  There is a challenge posted to higher education. That is to attune its present educational goals, objectives, and mission-vision to the demands of a globalized world. Consequently, institutions, especially in the developing countries, have started to reconstruct their global dynamics of knowledge production through establishing linkage among institutions across nations. Generally, the common set of internalization of higher education highlights the importance of promoting cultural diversity and fostering intercultural understanding, respect, and tolerance among people (Turner and Robinson, 2007). These reiterations of what internationalization of higher education should emphasize are actually based on the profound belief that the cultural heritage of people is universal and humankind shares the bond off humanity and global citizenship in the process off advancement of knowledge (Wing, 2010)...

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Various Indigenous peoples’ education initiatives in the Philippines, including recent efforts of the Department of Education, bring to light the continuing need to develop mathematics lessons that are culturally relevant for Indigenous Filipino students. In general, teachers involved in Indigenous peoples’ education have difficulty in developing culturally relevant mathematics lessons, with the relative  exception of PAMANA KA, a school for Indigenous Mangyan in San Jose, Mindoro. My current involvement with this school as well as with the Gohang National High School in Banaue, Ifugao, shows how a modified framework for an ethnomathematical curriculum model admits a wider possibility for mathematical thinking and investigation based on cultural practice. Ethnomathematics may be a useful theoretical framework for the pursuit of culturally relevant mathematics education in the Philippines.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>No, with the educational system the Philippines have, it is only a few students have acquired quality, culture based and complete basic education. It is crucial for every student to learn more in school rather than practice cheating for a competition to class rankings. Most students only acquire lessons they are compelled to study with, and forget about it in the later time. Indeed, it is a privilege of the few as these few students are eagerly instilling the lessons that could help them in the future. In order for students to retain their lessons longer, it is important for a teacher to construct a strategy in order to hone the students' skills and abilities.</p><br />

Write your opinions consisting of an introduction, body, and conclusion similar with the text presented below. Cambodia and Myanmar both have rich cultures. However, due to globalization, it has become a challenge for both countries to preserve their cultures. This problem arose in Cambodia spectically after the Khmer Rouge. One way to bring the people back to their cultural roots is to revive the Cambodian arts, including their literature, music, and performing arts. Also, the state has established monuments and schools to educate the Cambodians on the field of arts. Myanmar also did the same in preserving their culture. However, the big challenge is preserving their cultural heritage. This is due to the fast urbanization of Myanmar. This is why the Myanmar government adapted the intang ble Cultural Heritage Convention of 2003 from the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) to preserve their cultural heritage such as monuments and cultural sites (Aspillaga 2013). Countries all over the world, including the Philippines have different ways in keeping their cultures alive. Culture serves as our identity as a nation. Therefore, it is of great importance that governments give priority to preserving one's culture. It is indeed the soul of a nation. 语 What is culture based on the given text? Why is culture considered as the soul of every nation? In the Philippines, can you name museums and local heritage sites that represent the culture of our country? As Filipinos, how should we preserve our culture like our Asian neighboring countries?​</h2><br />

Discuss the potential benefits and challenges of incorporating local culture into education.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The Constructivist Theory and traditional teaching approaches differ significantly in the context of teaching MTB-MLE. Traditional teaching methods emphasize the teacher as the primary source of knowledge and use a standardized curriculum, while Constructivist Theory emphasizes active learning and student-centered approaches. In MTB-MLE, Constructivist Theory supports the use of local languages as a medium of instruction, which enables students to connect their learning to their own culture and experiences. Traditional teaching methods, on the other hand, may not be as effective in supporting students' language development and cultural identity.</p><p></p><p>2.Implementing a Constructivist approach in MTB-MLE can be challenging because it requires a significant shift in teaching practices and the creation of culturally relevant materials. However, it can also provide opportunities for students to engage in active learning and develop critical thinking skills. The potential benefits of adopting a Constructivist approach include improved language development, increased engagement and motivation, and better academic performance. However, there may be drawbacks, such as the need for more resources and training for teachers. The effectiveness of a Constructivist approach in MTB-MLE may also depend on the specific context and community in which it is being taught.</p><p></p><p>3.Knowing the mother tongue is significant in education because it enables learners to connect their learning to their own culture and experiences. Using the mother tongue as a medium of instruction can also improve learners' language development and overall academic performance. Additionally, using the mother tongue can help preserve and promote local languages and cultures. However, the disadvantages of using the mother tongue include limited access to learning materials and limited opportunities for students to learn additional languages that may be necessary for future academic and professional endeavors.</p><p></p><p>4.Understanding the local culture is important in education because it allows teachers to create culturally relevant materials and practices that engage students and promote learning. Incorporating local culture into teaching practices can also promote cultural diversity and respect. Effective incorporation of local culture involves engaging with the community, identifying local resources and practices, and creating learning materials that reflect students' experiences and cultural backgrounds. The potential benefits of incorporating local culture into education include increased student engagement and motivation, improved academic performance, and the promotion of cultural diversity. However, challenges may include limited resources and the need for cultural sensitivity and understanding</p><br />

Do this activity on a separate one whole sheet of paper. There is a challenge posted to higher education. That is to attune its present educational goals, objectives, and mission-vision to the demands of a globalized world. Consequently, institutions, especially in the developing countries, have started to reconstruct their global dynamics of knowledge production through establishing linkage among institutions across nations. Generally, the common set of internalization of higher education highlights the importance of promoting cultural diversity and fostering intercultural understanding, respect, and tolerance among people (Turner and Robinson, 2007). These reiterations of what internationalization of higher education should emphasize are actually based on the profound belief that the cultural heritage of people is universal and humankind shares the bond off humanity and global citizenship in the process off advancement of knowledge (Wing, 2010)...
