Black, Brown, White By Nemah N. Hermosa (Adapted from a Philippine folktale) Once upon a time, there were no people. There was only the Earth and the god Kabunian. He said, "The earth is a beautiful place. But who will take care of it? I will make people." In the afternoon, Kabunian got some clay. He worked for a long time. When he finished making a man, it was night. The color of the night became the color of the man. "He is too dark," Kabunian said. The next morning, Kabunian woke up before sunrise. He got some clay. He made a man. When the sun came up, Kabunian saw the man. "He is too white," Kabunian said. So Kabunian got more clay. He made another man. It was noon. The hot sun made the man brown. "I like this brown man," said Kabunian. Kabunian sent the men to different parts of the Earth. That is why there are black people and white people. That is why Filipinos are brown. Questions: 1. Who made the men? 2. When was the brown man made? 3. Where did Kabunian send the men? 4. What is the color of the man made at night?5. Why did Kabunian create the men?​</a>

Can you go to the store and buy some?” “Ok!”, said Ella. She got some money from her mother and left. Ella took her bicycle to the store. She bought the eggs, but when she was about to leave, the store manager stopped her. “Wait, young lady,” he said. “You forgot your change!” “Thank you so much!” replied Ella. As she left the store, Ella saw her friend Max. They walked home together. It was a fun day!Story 2 	Once upon a time, Princess Ella woke up in her castle and jumped out of the bed. “Good morning, Mr. Whiskers!” she said to her cat. “Good morning, Ella!” Mr. Whiskers answered. Then Ella went downstairs for breakfast. “Ella,” her evil stepmother said, “we’re out of golden eggs. Go to the store and buy some right now!” “Ok!”, said Ella. She had no money, so she took the magic beans her fairy godmother had given her to trade and left. Princess Ella took her magical broom and flew to the store. She traded the magic beans for the golden eggs, but when she was about to leave, a fire-breathing dragon stopped her at the door. “Wait, young lady,” he said. “You must defeat me first, or I will eat you!” “Oh no!” replied Ella. Just then, Prince Max rode in on his white horse and slayed the dragon. They rode off together to the castle. And they lived happily ever after! ​</a>

He had a lovely daughter whom he lovingly named Marigold. Although King Midas had immense wealth in his kingdom’s treasury, he was always dissatisfied and unhappy. He was always greedy for more wealth and wished he had more gold in his treasure. One day as he was counting gold coins and admiring his treasure rooms, a wise Greek God appeared before him who offered the king a wish for some of his good deeds. Without wasting any time, King Midas quickly wished that everything that he touched should turn into gold. The Greek God granted his wish promptly and disappeared. King Midas was delighted about his wish being granted, he went and touched an apple tree in his garden. To his excitement, the tree turned into gold instantly. He was so thrilled that he went on touching random things all around him, which turned into gold immediately. His joy knew no bounds and he was overwhelmed with excitement. Soon he was hungry and he returned to his palace to eat some food. However, though he was starving, he was disappointed that he could not eat anything as whatever he touched turned into gold instantly. Seeing him frustrated and troubled, Marigold came running and threw her arms around her father to comfort him. But to his dismay, even his daughter turned into gold as he touched her. King Midas’ face turned pale and his heart sank with unbearable pain and grief. He was horrified upon seeing his daughter turn into a golden statue. He cried in anguish and regretted his wish of the golden touch. In no time, he realized his greed was his biggest ever mistake and begged the Greek God to take back his wish. Soon the Greek God appeared before him and felt pity for his condition and took back the golden touch wish from him. Further, the wise God instructed King Midas to take a dip in the pond of his palace and sprinkle that water to all those things which he wanted to change back to the previous condition. He blindly followed the instructions and soon his daughter, Marigold was back to normal when he sprinkled the water on her. Thereafter, he was elated to get back his beloved daughter and promised to stop being greedy henceforth. 6-8. Who were the characters in the story? 9-10. Where is the setting of the story?

Black, Brown, White By Nemah N. Hermosa (Adapted from a Philippine folktale) Once upon a time, there were no people. There was only the Earth and the god Kabunian. He said, "The earth is a beautiful place. But who will take care of it? I will make people." In the afternoon, Kabunian got some clay. He worked for a long time. When he finished making a man, it was night. The color of the night became the color of the man. "He is too dark," Kabunian said. The next morning, Kabunian woke up before sunrise. He got some clay. He made a man. When the sun came up, Kabunian saw the man. "He is too white," Kabunian said. So Kabunian got more clay. He made another man. It was noon. The hot sun made the man brown. "I like this brown man," said Kabunian. Kabunian sent the men to different parts of the Earth. That is why there are black people and white people. That is why Filipinos are brown. Questions: 1. Who made the men? 2. When was the brown man made? 3. Where did Kabunian send the men? 4. What is the color of the man made at night?5. Why did Kabunian create the men?​</h2><br />

He had a lovely daughter whom he lovingly named Marigold. Although King Midas had immense wealth in his kingdom’s treasury, he was always dissatisfied and unhappy. He was always greedy for more wealth and wished he had more gold in his treasure. One day as he was counting gold coins and admiring his treasure rooms, a wise Greek God appeared before him who offered the king a wish for some of his good deeds. Without wasting any time, King Midas quickly wished that everything that he touched should turn into gold. The Greek God granted his wish promptly and disappeared. King Midas was delighted about his wish being granted, he went and touched an apple tree in his garden. To his excitement, the tree turned into gold instantly. He was so thrilled that he went on touching random things all around him, which turned into gold immediately. His joy knew no bounds and he was overwhelmed with excitement. Soon he was hungry and he returned to his palace to eat some food. However, though he was starving, he was disappointed that he could not eat anything as whatever he touched turned into gold instantly. Seeing him frustrated and troubled, Marigold came running and threw her arms around her father to comfort him. But to his dismay, even his daughter turned into gold as he touched her. King Midas’ face turned pale and his heart sank with unbearable pain and grief. He was horrified upon seeing his daughter turn into a golden statue. He cried in anguish and regretted his wish of the golden touch. In no time, he realized his greed was his biggest ever mistake and begged the Greek God to take back his wish. Soon the Greek God appeared before him and felt pity for his condition and took back the golden touch wish from him. Further, the wise God instructed King Midas to take a dip in the pond of his palace and sprinkle that water to all those things which he wanted to change back to the previous condition. He blindly followed the instructions and soon his daughter, Marigold was back to normal when he sprinkled the water on her. Thereafter, he was elated to get back his beloved daughter and promised to stop being greedy henceforth. 6-8. Who were the characters in the story? 9-10. Where is the setting of the story?
