Modular Distance Learning features individualized instruction that allows learners to self-learning modules (SLMs) in print or digital format/electronic copy, whichever is applicable to the learner. Usually, teachers will have to deliver appropriate learning materials. Modular teaching is more effective in teaching learning process as compared to ordinary teaching methods. Because in this modular approach the students learn at their own pace. You need to find a time that allows you to be alone to study. Chances of distraction high: With no teacher around for face-to-face interaction and no classmates who can help with constant reminders about pending assignments, the chances of getting distracted and losing track of deadlines are high.

                                            Chickering and Zelda (1991) identified five principles of online learning. The first principle is to establish regular effective contact which requires a specific time for instruction and progress monitoring. The second principle is to create opportunities for student-centered learning – a task that took most of the time of the teachers' planning. There are instances when teachers become the center of interaction in the online environment, given the number of MELCs that they need to cover. The third principle is to create practical, real world applications that provide authentic tasks for students despite the remote learning scenario. The fourth principle is to provide support for student-learning and autonomy.Teachers should provide aid for learners to maximize skills development. The last principle is to ensure all course content is readily and easily accessible to all students – an area that teachers tried to compensate by uploading materials on a weekly or semi-weekly basis. 1.

                                            Assess the credibility of the article below using the checklist. DepEd clarifies blended, distance learning modalities for SY 2020-2021 QUEZON CITY, July 3 (PIA) - The Department of Education (DepEd) clarifies blended and distance learning modality to be implemented this school year, as the agency prepares for a "new method of transmitting learning." In view of the recent information circulating online, DepEd is quick to clarify that online is not the only delivery modality of teaching and learning the department is devising. "Ang pag-aaral ngayong school year ay HINDI LAMANG gagawin online. Inihanda ng DepEd ang iba't ibang paraan ng pag-aaral na aakma sa lahat ng uri ng pamumuhay sa komunidad. Ang self-learning modules (SLM) ay ang pangunahing gagamitin sa pagtuturo," DepEd statement said. Although some parents have been worried for the continued education of their children amid pandemic, DepEd assured that different Education Learning Continuity Plan will be implemented depending on learners' access to technology and the situation they are in. "Some of the lessons will be transmitted through different platforms and some activities will be done at home," Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said in a virtual press briefing. To avoid face-to-face interactions, DepEd offers blended and distance learning modalities by using printed or digital modules, online learning resources, and radio and TV-based instructions. Distance learning refers to a learning delivery modality where leaming takes place between the teacher and the learners who are geographically remote from each other during instruction.It has three learning modalities: (1) modular distance learning uses self-learning modules that are printed or in digital format; (2) online distance learning uses the Internet in downloading learning materials and uploading homeworks; and (3) Radio/TV based instructions to those who have no Internet connectivity. Meanwhile, blended learning refers to a mix of online distance learning, modular distance learning, and TV/Radio-based Instruction. Homeschooling option is learning in a home-based environment to be facilitated by qualified parents, guardians or tutors who have undergone relevant training. "We need to prepare not only the schools, learners, administrators, and teaching and non-teaching personnel, but also the parents and guardians of the learners," Briones said. These alternative learning methods depend "very heavily on parents and community support to make its Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) successful. "Education becomes more and more a shared activity, and we ask the parents and the community and experts and to join us on our effort," Briones said (MTQ/PIA-IDPD).Can this article be considered credible?

Modular Distance Learning features individualized instruction that allows learners to self-learning modules (SLMs) in print or digital format/electronic copy, whichever is applicable to the learner. Usually, teachers will have to deliver appropriate learning materials. Modular teaching is more effective in teaching learning process as compared to ordinary teaching methods. Because in this modular approach the students learn at their own pace. You need to find a time that allows you to be alone to study. Chances of distraction high: With no teacher around for face-to-face interaction and no classmates who can help with constant reminders about pending assignments, the chances of getting distracted and losing track of deadlines are high.

Majority of the islands in the Philippine Archipelago are considered as part of the Philippines mobile belt. 4. The Southern edge of the Philippines sea plates are considered as part of island arcs.5. In the Philippines, the highland sections of the Sundaland block of the Eurasian plate includes Palawan, Mindoro and Zamboanga Peninsula.6.

Pandemic is a theory which suggest that Earth's crust is made up of plates that interact in various ways, thus producing earthquakes, mountains, and volcanoes. 12. Developmental volcanic arc are mountains formed as part of igneous activity associated with subduction of oceanic lithosphere beneath a continent. 13. Centennial crust is the thick part of the Earth's crust, not located under the ocean. 14. Trench Crust is the thin part of the Earth's crust located under the ocean. 15.

                                            INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

                                            For learners to acquire language, meaningful communicative opportunities fornegotiation and interaction are needed (Beckett, 1999; Swain, 1995; Kern&amp; Warschauer, 2000). Likewise, the integration of instructional materials (IMs)augments the stimulation of ideas for classroom activities (Cunnigsworth, 1995;Dudley-Evans &amp; St.John, 1998). Hence, this paper aimed to reboot the ESLClassroom via technology-based instructional materials (TBIMs). Specifically, itsought answers to the following objectives: (1) identify the TBIMs in ESL classrooms;(2) determine the problems encountered on TBIMs; (3) present the implications ofTBIMs; and (4) propose augmentation on TBIMs. The descriptive type of research andthe stratified random sampling technique were employed. Respondents were drawnfrom the senior high school students of Grade 11 enrolled in English for Academicand Professional Purposes (EAPP) during first semester of school year 2017-2018,and five (5) English Language Teachers at San Francisco B National High School,Lopez, Quezon. The collection of data was accomplished through: (1) administrationof a modified questionnaire on TBIMs and (2) conduct of a follow-up interview on theencountered problems and implications of TBIMs. The findings revealed thatrespondents have an unenthusiastic perception on the feasibility/effectiveness ofTBIMs to supplement the teaching and learning of the language. Nevertheless, thefindings showed more affirmative viewpoints that TBIMs had somehow increasedtheir level of interest in English and boot up the ESL classroom as well. Even thoughTBIMs remained insufficient and usually unavailable, the researcher still consideredthe returns of being equipped with knowledge and gadgets. But still, in order toemploy TBIMs in supplementing the English language teaching and learning,auxiliary and in-depth discussions and scrutiny about the applicability of TBIMshave to be made. A very short course or workshop (technology-based teaching andlearning camp) is suggested to ESL teachers in order to help them increaseknowledge in TBIMs and to create a link between the virtual world and the real worldamong the students.1.what issue or concept is presented in the text​</a>

                            7. Chickering and Zelda (1991) identified five principles of online learning. The first principle is to establish regular effective contact which requires a specific time for instruction and progress monitoring. The second principle is to create opportunities for student-centered learning – a task that took most of the time of the teachers' planning. There are instances when teachers become the center of interaction in the online environment, given the number of MELCs that they need to cover. The third principle is to create practical, real world applications that provide authentic tasks for students despite the remote learning scenario. The fourth principle is to provide support for student-learning and autonomy.Teachers should provide aid for learners to maximize skills development. The last principle is to ensure all course content is readily and easily accessible to all students – an area that teachers tried to compensate by uploading materials on a weekly or semi-weekly basis. 1.

                            11. INTRODUCTION:RefractionIt refers to the bending of light as it passes through different materials.ReflectionIt refers to the bouncing back of light when it hits an object. Some objects withflat surfaces like mirrors, reflect light in a straight, predictable way. Some objects withuneven surfaces like rocks, reflect light in a scattered way.AbsorptionIt refers to materials taking in light but not reflecting it back.TransmissionIt refers to the passing of light through some materials.SITUATIONIn this activity , you will create a journal that records how the light absorb, reflect, refract and transmit.INSTRUCTION:1. Look around your room to find examples of items (mediums) that transmit,reflect, refract, and absorb. Write it down in your supposed journal (paper)2. After you visit and interact with those materials, they can add another item inthe house.3. Go over how lights behaves with each item.4. Write all your observations through a paper.Guided Questions:1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. In the water cycle, evaporation occurs when sunlight warms the surface of the water. The heat from the sun makes the water molecules move faster and faster, until they move so fast they escape as a gas. Once evaporated, a molecule of water vapor spends about ten days in the air.</p><p>2.Light refracts whenever it travels at an angle into a substance with a different refractive index (optical density). This change of direction is caused by a change in speed. For example, when light travels from air into water, it slows down, causing it to continue to travel at a different angle or direction.</p><p>3.The effect when the glass was held at different heights and angles is called refraction. Refraction is the bending of light as it passes from one transparent medium into another. It can also happens with sound, water and other waves.</p><p>4. When light that is traveling through the air hits water, some of the light is reflected off the water. The rest of the light passes through the water but it bends (or refracts) as it enters the water. The same thing happens when light hits glass or any other transparent material.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>there.</p><br />

DepEd clarifies blended, distance learning modalities for SY 2020-2021 QUEZON CITY, July 3 (PIA) - The Department of Education (DepEd) clarifies blended and distance learning modality to be implemented this school year, as the agency prepares for a "new method of transmitting learning." In view of the recent information circulating online, DepEd is quick to clarify that online is not the only delivery modality of teaching and learning the department is devising. "Ang pag-aaral ngayong school year ay HINDI LAMANG gagawin online. Inihanda ng DepEd ang iba't ibang paraan ng pag-aaral na aakma sa lahat ng uri ng pamumuhay sa komunidad. Ang self-learning modules (SLM) ay ang pangunahing gagamitin sa pagtuturo," DepEd statement said. Although some parents have been worried for the continued education of their children amid pandemic, DepEd assured that different Education Learning Continuity Plan will be implemented depending on learners' access to technology and the situation they are in. "Some of the lessons will be transmitted through different platforms and some activities will be done at home," Education Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones said in a virtual press briefing. To avoid face-to-face interactions, DepEd offers blended and distance learning modalities by using printed or digital modules, online learning resources, and radio and TV-based instructions. Distance learning refers to a learning delivery modality where leaming takes place between the teacher and the learners who are geographically remote from each other during instruction.It has three learning modalities: (1) modular distance learning uses self-learning modules that are printed or in digital format; (2) online distance learning uses the Internet in downloading learning materials and uploading homeworks; and (3) Radio/TV based instructions to those who have no Internet connectivity. Meanwhile, blended learning refers to a mix of online distance learning, modular distance learning, and TV/Radio-based Instruction. Homeschooling option is learning in a home-based environment to be facilitated by qualified parents, guardians or tutors who have undergone relevant training. "We need to prepare not only the schools, learners, administrators, and teaching and non-teaching personnel, but also the parents and guardians of the learners," Briones said. These alternative learning methods depend "very heavily on parents and community support to make its Basic Education Learning Continuity Plan (BE-LCP) successful. "Education becomes more and more a shared activity, and we ask the parents and the community and experts and to join us on our effort," Briones said (MTQ/PIA-IDPD).Can this article be considered credible?

                            22. INTERACTIVE SLIDE DECK IN ENGLISH FOR GRADE VI LEARNERS OF ILOILO CENTRAL ELEMENTARY SCHOOL
Teachers use a wide variety of tools to foster learning while having fun. Instructional Materials are used in educational lessons which include active learning and assessment that can support students in their academic performance. The technology will allow teachers to bridge these learning experiences more naturally and seamlessly. As more digital tools become available and accessible that facilitate learning in multiple modalities, just as effective teachers in the 21e century will continue to maximize and seek avenues to improve student learning. Interactive lessons and activities prompt students to engage with content rather than passively absorb it. Gamified activities involving internet connections and laptops through PowerPoint presentations are fun ways to review their understanding of the learning content. They are more focused, attentive, and participative in class discussions. Deep learning occurs through experiential, authentic, and collaborative Instructional processes. The pursuit for higher Mean Percentage Score from First to Fourth Grading Periodic Tests had challenged the subject teachers to come up with a teacher-made learning material that pushes students to Internalize and support learning in a creative way. Instead, more professional learning time should be spent helping teachers plan, develop materials and practice delivering the strategies with colleague support Addressing this problem can have a very real positive effect on student performance, A slide deck presentation is an exposition of a series of slides or images in an electronic device or in a projection screen. It is a collection of slides put together in the same presentation, and it is essential for teachers to have a well-structured presentation With this, an Interactive Slide Deck in English for Grade V Learners was materialized to help the English Grade VI teachers to lessen the burden of finding resource materials that include all the learning competencies from First to Fourth Quarter. This learning material contains 545 slides classified according to competencies and objectives aligned to the Grade VI English curriculum guide. This was utilized by the Grade 1 English Teachers among 379 Grade VI pupils of Iloilo Central Elementary School for the school year 2018-2019. In our quest to improve our children's overall performance in support to L&amp;D program implementation, preparation of learner's materials and resource package development is our topmost priority. The findings call for a more teacher and students' friendly approach in monitoring and assessing the academic performance in the English content area and quality of students' analysis, which this instructional material will address. May this learning material facilitate learners' acquisition of knowledge, skills and attitude to create a 21st century learning environment by blending physical and digital arrangements inside the classroom.

                            26. For learners to acquire language, meaningful communicative opportunities fornegotiation and interaction are needed (Beckett, 1999; Swain, 1995; Kern&amp; Warschauer, 2000). Likewise, the integration of instructional materials (IMs)augments the stimulation of ideas for classroom activities (Cunnigsworth, 1995;Dudley-Evans &amp; St.John, 1998). Hence, this paper aimed to reboot the ESLClassroom via technology-based instructional materials (TBIMs). Specifically, itsought answers to the following objectives: (1) identify the TBIMs in ESL classrooms;(2) determine the problems encountered on TBIMs; (3) present the implications ofTBIMs; and (4) propose augmentation on TBIMs. The descriptive type of research andthe stratified random sampling technique were employed. Respondents were drawnfrom the senior high school students of Grade 11 enrolled in English for Academicand Professional Purposes (EAPP) during first semester of school year 2017-2018,and five (5) English Language Teachers at San Francisco B National High School,Lopez, Quezon. The collection of data was accomplished through: (1) administrationof a modified questionnaire on TBIMs and (2) conduct of a follow-up interview on theencountered problems and implications of TBIMs. The findings revealed thatrespondents have an unenthusiastic perception on the feasibility/effectiveness ofTBIMs to supplement the teaching and learning of the language. Nevertheless, thefindings showed more affirmative viewpoints that TBIMs had somehow increasedtheir level of interest in English and boot up the ESL classroom as well. Even thoughTBIMs remained insufficient and usually unavailable, the researcher still consideredthe returns of being equipped with knowledge and gadgets. But still, in order toemploy TBIMs in supplementing the English language teaching and learning,auxiliary and in-depth discussions and scrutiny about the applicability of TBIMshave to be made. A very short course or workshop (technology-based teaching andlearning camp) is suggested to ESL teachers in order to help them increaseknowledge in TBIMs and to create a link between the virtual world and the real worldamong the students.1.what issue or concept is presented in the text​</h2><br />

Communication also has different elemer which was already cited and defined in your previous module. To test your learnings in the previous 3 modules which centers on the Function, Nature and Proc of Communication your task is to create a "Model of Communication" INSTRUCTIONS: 1. In order to create your "Model of Communication" you really need first to decide which functio of Communication you really want to give emphasis it could be control, social Interaction, Motivation, Emotional expression and Information Dissemination. 2. The Elements of Communication must be present in your model (Sender, Message, Receiver, Feedback and Channel) 3. The Model of Communication is presented in 3 dimensional not in painting or drawing. 4. For your materials, you can use recycled materials such as used 1/8 cardboards/illustration boards, cartoon, papers, cans, plastics, and any other. 5. The submission of your output will be during the Module Distribution and Retrieval and directly submit to your subject teacher Sir Khim. 6. Your output will be Rated according to the Rubric.​</h2><br />
