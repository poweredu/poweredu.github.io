                                            Analyze and comprehend the given interview transcription. Use codes in order to identify patterns and themes. Q1: What has motivated you to share, with so many people watching, all the personal parts of your life? A: My intention was never to become a tabloid. So when things kind of happened that way, it got out of control. And then I was like, “Wait, none of this is true.” The way the media has sometimes tried to explain things has made it sound really bad, when in reality there's nothing wrong with the fact that I needed to go away or that I fell in love. I had to start opening up because people were taking away my narrative and it was killing me. I'm so young and I'm going to keep changing, and no one has the right to tell me how my life's going.​​plss pa answer po​</a>

Q1: What has motivated you to share, with so many people watching, all the personal parts of your life? A: My intention was never to become a tabloid. So when things kind of happened that way, it got out of control. And then I was like, “Wait, none of this is true.” The way the media has sometimes tried to explain things has made it sound really bad, when in reality there's nothing wrong with the fact that I needed to go away or that I fell in love. I had to start opening up because people were taking away my narrative and it was killing me. I'm so young and I'm going to keep changing, and no one has the right to tell me how my life's going.​</a>

The year 2020 was one of my most awaited years because I had a lot of plans for this year and this decade, My friends and I had planned to visit several cities before the year ended. I had also planned to visit several relatives and to work more this year with the kids from church. However, this has turned out to be a historical year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the virus started in China, no one would have imagined that it would cross borders and would hit the world like it has today. Worse of all , I would never have imagined that I would see the most deaths from a virus in such a short time. Though everything seems tough at this moment, I have also witnessed some positives, and one of them is that the pandemic has forced me to spend time with my family and appreciate life and other basics such as food and shelter, which I always took for granted. My resilience level has also gone high because I have become tough from the situations around me. For example, I can now cope with being indoors the whole day. I also find myself being even more creative with my family.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>1. Too much social media can negatively affect users of all ages. "When people use social media more, their body dissatisfaction increases," Winton said. "They're more likely to be in a negative mood. They're more likely to view the thin ideal as something they want to aspire to."2.Without social media sites, there would be more mystery and you would have to form your own opinion of them from your experiences. Prior to social media sites, your friends were actually your friends, people you would see, spend time with, laugh and cry with and most importantly have a real-life relationship with.3.Social media can be a useful tool for businesses, bringing advantages such as engaging with your audience and boosting website traffic. However there can also be disadvantages, including the resources required and negative feedback.4.How to Use Social Media Responsibly:
Be Friends with Your Parents, Consider the “Front Yard Test”

                            6. Analyze and comprehend the given interview transcription. Use codes in order to identify patterns and themes. Q1: What has motivated you to share, with so many people watching, all the personal parts of your life? A: My intention was never to become a tabloid. So when things kind of happened that way, it got out of control. And then I was like, “Wait, none of this is true.” The way the media has sometimes tried to explain things has made it sound really bad, when in reality there's nothing wrong with the fact that I needed to go away or that I fell in love. I had to start opening up because people were taking away my narrative and it was killing me. I'm so young and I'm going to keep changing, and no one has the right to tell me how my life's going.​​plss pa answer po​</h2><br />

While social media can have many positive effects, it also has some negative effects that should be considered.</p><p></p><p>One of the most obvious effects of social media is its ability to connect people from different parts of the world. Social media platforms allow people to connect with friends and family members who live far away, as well as to connect with people who share similar interests. This can help to build strong, supportive communities and to foster a sense of belonging.</p><p></p><p>Another effect of social media is its ability to influence our behavior.

The year 2020 was one of my most awaited years because I had a lot of plans for this year and this decade, My friends and I had planned to visit several cities before the year ended. I had also planned to visit several relatives and to work more this year with the kids from church. However, this has turned out to be a historical year because of the COVID-19 pandemic. When the virus started in China, no one would have imagined that it would cross borders and would hit the world like it has today. Worse of all , I would never have imagined that I would see the most deaths from a virus in such a short time. Though everything seems tough at this moment, I have also witnessed some positives, and one of them is that the pandemic has forced me to spend time with my family and appreciate life and other basics such as food and shelter, which I always took for granted. My resilience level has also gone high because I have become tough from the situations around me. For example, I can now cope with being indoors the whole day. I also find myself being even more creative with my family.
