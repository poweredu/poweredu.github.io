Cultural relativism is not really a vital tool in Anthropology.2.Behavior cannot be compared to the culture and environment, showing how mores and taboos came to be without judging those ethics.3.According to plato,man is the measure of all things of the things which are, that they are not.4.The concept of cultural relativism as we know and use it today was establish as an analytic tool by German-American antrophologist France Boas in the early 20th century.5.Cultural relativism warns as, quit rightly, about the danger of assuming that all of our practices are based on some absolute rational standard.6.Culturalrealtivism begins with the insight that many of our practices are like this-they are only cultural products.7.Cultural relativism wrongly claims that each culture has it's  own district but equally valid mode of perception, thought and choice.8.There is sometimes a strange notion that there are no commonalities between cultures.9.The English term "relativism" came into usage only in the 18th century.10.Cultural relativism, the opposite of the idea that moral truth is universal and objective,contends there is no such things as absolute right and wrong.Sana po ay matulungan Niyo ako​</a>

It has affected everything and everyone. It has taken lives and is continuouslyinfecting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, around the world. To date, scientistsand health experts are still working together to discover a vaccine as a means to cureand to stop the spread of the aforesaid virus. Currently, the best ways for people not tocontract the virus are to observe proper hygiene, frequent hand washing, and use ofmask and alcohol anytime, anywhere, and everywhere they go. Equally important, is tostrengthen one’s immune system by eating healthy and nutritious food, having enoughrest and sleep, as well as doing healthy exercises. Furthermore, staying at home andstrictly observing physical distancing are also some of the best measures in avoiding thecontraction of the virus.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME1.)____________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER2.)___________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE3.)___________========================It’s Adverb Harvest Time!Read the text below and pick all the adverbs you can see, and then put them inthe column where they belong in the table provided below.Man and FaithBy Eneri S. OgeinamBowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilienceare again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one isexempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying7loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also, on a lighter note,it came as a great global equalizer.This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and severaluniversal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary.Our life, our wealth, and all possessions we have, including our own skills andknowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even themost powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything isunpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation,we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go, and our social connectionsand interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations, and all things we hold dearly,with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftlybecomes volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA worldwhere all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change.And the very question is, “Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on thegovernment, family, and friends for help?As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More thanever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faithto a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps usgoing¢ and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and hugechanges in this “new normal”. We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, wecontinue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive always. We learn how to look at thebrighter side of life and choose to be optimistic amid the negativity around. Hence, ourfaith spells the big difference in facing all forms of life’s challenges. Therefore, let us holdonto our faith strongly and dearly for as long as we believe we will never tremble norfear the unseen. Remember, God is greatest and strongest above all forms of virusessuch as this COVID-19.WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF TIME4.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF PLACE5.)______________WRITE HERE ALL THE ADVERBS OF MANNER6.)______________</a>

                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p></p>Save This Word! A statement by the ancient Greek philosopher Protagoras. It is usually interpreted to mean that the individual human being, rather than a god or an unchanging moral law, is the ultimate source of value.<p></p>Explanation:<p></p>Protagoras of Abdera (l.c. 485-415 BCE) is most famous for his claim that "Of all things the measure is Man, of the things that are, that they are, and of the things that are not, that they are not" (DK 80B1) usually rendered simply as "Man is the Measure of All Things". Along these same lines, he also maintained that, if there were gods - as the Greeks, of course, believed - there was no way of knowing what they were like or what they might want from humanity by way of service and worship. <p></p>In maintaining this stance he pre-figures the existential relativism of writers like the 20th century CE Italian playwright, author, and philosopher Luigi Pirandello (l. 1867-1936 CE) best known for his works Henry IV, Six Characters in Search of an Author, and It is so, If you think so, by some two thousand plus years as well as every other relativist author between his time and Pirandello's.<p></p>Protagoras lived and worked in ancient Athens as a sophist, a highly paid teacher of the upper class youth of the city, who instructed his pupils in how to speak well and, especially, how to win court cases. Athens was particularly litigious and law suits were common; knowing how to turn a jury to side with one's claims was a highly prized skill and, it seems, Protagoras was very good at this.<p></p>At the same time, however, and in spite of how highly the Athenians valued his services, the cultural values of the Greeks during this time was informed by their religion and criticism of the gods was not welcome nor encouraged, much less denying their existence or claiming that, if they existed, one could not know what they were like. It is curious to consider, then, how a man who claimed that what was true to each individual was, in fact, true - regardless of any cultural values to the contrary -could come to be the most highly paid sophist in ancient Greece.<p></p>HOPE IT HELPS ❣️<p></p>#CARRYONLEARNING❣️#STUDYHARD❣️<br />

                        it means for me that a man is like example someone is kind yes it;s true, but he or she cpould be never that kind of a human being who can do thing better than what he or she is showing to everyone.<br /><br />hope it helps  <br /><br />-ninah ;)According to Protagoras, everything is relative. By relative, it means that what something is depends solely on how man perceives it. Regardless of its truth value, something is something because that is how man chooses to see it. And this perception is often influenced by the situation he is in and by his experiences.<br />

To date, scientistsand health experts are still working together to discover a vaccine as a means to cureand to stop the spread of the aforesaid virus. Currently, the best ways for people not tocontract the virus are to observe proper hygiene, frequent hand washing, and use ofmask and alcohol anytime, anywhere, and everywhere they go. Equally important, is tostrengthen one’s immune system by eating healthy and nutritious food, having enoughrest and sleep, as well as doing healthy exercises.

OgeinamBowed by the weight of this global pandemic, our human character and resilienceare again tested. Whether rich or poor, weak or strong, famous or not, no one isexempted by this COVID-19 virus. Since time immemorial, many have been crying7loudly and eagerly for equality. Suddenly, this cry was answered differently. Yes, COVID-19 came not just to cause havoc on humanity and economy; but also, on a lighter note,it came as a great global equalizer.This global pandemic opens doors towards various realizations and severaluniversal truths as points of reflection. Indeed, everything in life is but just temporary.Our life, our wealth, and all possessions we have, including our own skills andknowledge, they become limited, at times become meaningless and uncertain. Even themost powerful people and countries suddenly become powerless. Everything isunpredictable. We have no control of our time here on earth, for in this current situation,we all have nothing to behold. Our friends may come and go, and our social connectionsand interactions gradually cease. Dreams, aspirations, and all things we hold dearly,with a wink of an eye they slowly disappear like bubbles. Everything in this world swiftlybecomes volatile, uncertain, complex, and ambiguous. Indeed, we live in a VUCA worldwhere all of us need to swim by. Nothing is certain and the only constant now is change.And the very question is, “Who do we run to? Can we fully and truly rely on thegovernment, family, and friends for help?As we battle this global pandemic, all we need is a positive mindset. More thanever, it is a time indeed of awakening, rekindling, and strengthening our FAITH. Faithto a supreme being, our God Almighty is primarily the source of our hope that keeps usgoing¢ and enables us to conquer our fears and anxieties amid the gaps and hugechanges in this “new normal”. We all are caught off-guard, but with our faith, wecontinue to fight, to be proactive and to be positive always.
