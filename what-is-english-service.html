(An excerpt) Japanese believe that Filipinos are extremely hard-working. This is very easy to see, considering the wide variety of industries Filipinos work in and the number of hours they put in each day. You can see Filipinos working in healthcare, hospitality, electronics, food services, teaching, and construction among other industries. In fact, 100,000 Filipino workers might come to Japan as it looks to hire many foreign nationals. As a result, Filipinos have earned a high regard, continuing to enjoy a great reputation among Japanese. Moreover, they consider Filipinos good at speaking English. This is one of the reasons many Japanese tend to go to the Philippines to study English. Considering a flight between Tokyo and Manila lasts less than five​</a>

There are ups and downs that challenges us every day. But we see those challenges as a motivation to still continue the business. In a year we already have 35 regular costumers this is not bad because we are just only starting in this kind of business. Ever month we have new costumer who caters Exam tutorial. We also have 15 regular costumers for major subject tutorial. When it comes to profit? All I can say is that profit is not that enough but already good to continue the business running. Maybe two to three years from now we are still in the track, we are still continuing our services that provides follow up home schooling that helps the students to develop their attitudes in schooling. We also see that more parents will be open in this kind of tutorial set up. So, I think next year will be a more fruitful year for us more students for tutorial. We are also planning to add more alternative tutorial services that will help elementary and SHS students. One of the new services that we are planning is to have a college tutorial as well. All we need to do is to be positive and more dedicated on the business that we have right now. UPS and DOWNS are part of success.​</a>

Give three specific merchants where you can pay your bill.<p></p><p>With continual reminders to keep safe at home, it may appear that paying bills is a concern—when, in fact, it is the polar opposite. Paying bills is becoming increasingly simple, thanks to the advent of apps and websites that allow us to do so without leaving our homes. For example, Glo be allows you to pay your payments online in a variety of ways. There's an online payment app for your favorite Glo be products and services, whether you're a prepaid or postpaid customer.</p>Glo be Online Bills Payment at www.globe.com.ph/paybillGC ash app  ECPay/7-11/Sho pee
<p></p>2. You are assigned to search for several topics in your English subject. What search engine will you use and why? <p></p><p>I will use Go ogle as my search engine. The number of pages and links referring back to the original site can be used by Goo gle to determine a site's relevance. Go ogle's success has resulted in it being the most used search engine in the US, handling over 3 billion pages each day.</p><p>Go ogle's reputation has grown over time as a result of:</p>Their search algorithms are updated on a regular basis (technology and process for collecting relevant information)Putting the user, their goals, and their satisfaction first<p></p>3. Your task is to create an advertising campaign for your new business. What advertising platform will you use and why?<p>Small businesses can use advertising platforms provided by a number of major internet companies. According to Words tream, one well-known example is Go ogle's AdSense and AdWords campaigns. Online publishers – website owners, forum administrators, bloggers, and others — utilize Goo gle's AdSense to commercialize their sites by placing adverts on them. The platform that hosts and displays the adverts is AdSense. Goo gle uses bids from advertisers on specific keywords to choose which advertisements to show.</p><p>This is when AdWords from Goo gle comes in. Go ogle AdSense is for publishers, whereas Go ogle AdWords is for advertising, according to Go ogle. Advertisers who bid on keywords relating to their product or company, such as "non-oily hand cream" for a skincare company, are featured higher in search results and have their adverts displayed on connected websites with AdWords.</p>4. In your opinion, which is the best communication service provider? Give your reason.<p>It all depends on the availability of the network in your area. In my case, it is Smart Telecommunications. Smart Communications, Inc. (Smart) is PLDT's wholly-owned subsidiary and the Philippines' top wireless service provider, with 68.9 million cellular and broadband subscribers as of the end of 2015.</p><p>Smart has a reputation for being a trailblazer in the wireless industry, having created world-first cellular services like Smart Money, Smart Load, Smart Padala, and the Netphone. Smart delivers 3G, HSPA+, and LTE services, as well as communications to the global maritime industry through its Smart Satellite service.</p><p></p>5. Which social media best fits your lifestyle? Why?​<p>Since I love photography and videography, I choose Insta gram. Instagram is a mobile app that allows users to edit and upload photographs and short videos. Users can add a caption to each of their posts, and hashtags and location-based geotags can be used to index and search these posts within the app. When a user tags their posts with hashtags or geotags, they display in their followers' Instagram feeds and can also be accessed by the general public. Users can also make their profiles private, allowing only their followers to see their posts. </p><p></p><p></p><p>To know more about communication, click here</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/19076144</p><p>Hope this helps! :)</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYFAST</strong></p><br />

There are ups and downs that challenges us every day. But we see those challenges as a motivation to still continue the business. In a year we already have 35 regular costumers this is not bad because we are just only starting in this kind of business. Ever month we have new costumer who caters Exam tutorial. We also have 15 regular costumers for major subject tutorial. When it comes to profit? All I can say is that profit is not that enough but already good to continue the business running. Maybe two to three years from now we are still in the track, we are still continuing our services that provides follow up home schooling that helps the students to develop their attitudes in schooling. We also see that more parents will be open in this kind of tutorial set up. So, I think next year will be a more fruitful year for us more students for tutorial. We are also planning to add more alternative tutorial services that will help elementary and SHS students. One of the new services that we are planning is to have a college tutorial as well. All we need to do is to be positive and more dedicated on the business that we have right now. UPS and DOWNS are part of success.​</h2><br />
