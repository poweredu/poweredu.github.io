                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>“Ang kabataan ang pag-asa ng bayan”, these were the words said by the National Filipino Hero Jose Rizal. During his lifetime, he was devoted to the belief that what would make a country prosper are its own children. His beliefs may have been caused by the great show of bravery and courage in the Filipino youth of his time. He believed that the future will be better sooner or later. But has he expected too much? Decades have pass since his time and we can say that the Philippines has improved but to what extent? Yes, children of the past have indeed grown up and become great people in our country. As the years go by, a new generation of Filipinos has emerged. Sadly, with time comes change. </p><br />
