                                            Try to reflect on these... It is difficult for us to realize that once upon a time there were no symbols or names for numbers. In the early days, primitive man showed how many animals he owned by placing an equal number of stones in a pile, or sticks in a row. Truly our number system underwent the process of development for hundreds of centuries. 2. why do you think he needed names or words to tell "how many"?​</a>

                                            “The Lion and the Cows”
Once upon a time there
lived four cows in the forest.
Everyday they used to
graze together in a
particular spot. They were
all friends. One day a lion
saw the cows grazing
together.
The lion wanted to eat
them so he went to catch
them. When the cows
saw the lion, all of them
fought with him. The lion
had to run away.
A few day passed and the
cow quarreled between
themselves and started
grazing separately. One by
one the lion killed all of
them.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>that asking for forgiveness to someone can help you in the future and it is good to repay others who save your live in the past. And thanking someone even it is a small deed is a very heart wrenching moment. </p><br />

                            7. Try to reflect on these... It is difficult for us to realize that once upon a time there were no symbols or names for numbers. In the early days, primitive man showed how many animals he owned by placing an equal number of stones in a pile, or sticks in a row. Truly our number system underwent the process of development for hundreds of centuries. 2. why do you think he needed names or words to tell "how many"?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is likely that primitive man needed names or words for numbers in order to communicate effectively with others about quantities. Without a system of symbols or words to represent numbers, it would have been difficult for people to accurately convey information about the quantities of objects they had, such as the number of animals they owned or the amount of resources they had available. By developing a system of symbols or words to represent numbers, people were able to communicate more effectively with one another and make more accurate decisions about how to allocate resources and manage their possessions.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
