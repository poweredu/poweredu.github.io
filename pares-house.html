Tropical Fruits
By Veedol Dayata
Once you break its sturdy spiky shell
Then pare to partake the milk golden
If you can just ignore the odor of hell
Then you can taste a piece of heaven.
These red hairy suits coat the sweets
Lithe back ants save from fat aphids,
Rip them bare to bite of pulpy meats
Succulent, so tender without the pips.
A grenade sure to blast off your sense
Deep dark berries bomb their surprise
Thick creamy flesh stuns and deafens
Silent, juicy sugar slices all your prize.
Most fragrant of hearts in yellow ripe
Mouth-watering, sharp sour of green;
They whisper through their skin, tight
, pride even

Tropical Fruits
By Veedol Dayata
Once you break its sturdy spiky shell
Then pare to partake the milk golden
If you can just ignore the odor of hell
Then you can taste a piece of heaven.
These red hairy suits coat the sweets
Lithe back ants save from fat aphids,
Rip them bare to bite of pulpy meats
Succulent, so tender without the pips.
A grenade sure to blast off your sense
Deep dark berries bomb their surprise
Thick creamy flesh stuns and deafens
Silent, juicy sugar slices all your prize.
Most fragrant of hearts in yellow ripe
Mouth-watering, sharp sour of green;
They whisper through their skin, tight
, pride even
