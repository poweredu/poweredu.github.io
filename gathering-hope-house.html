                                            Read this article and write a critique using an appropriate approach and the appropriate format. Stop the Stigma Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel are literally putting themselves in harm’s way to protect the greater Filipino population against COVID-19. And yet, in an alarming twist, an increasing number of them, instead of being accorded the hero’s treatment they deserve, are being subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence, mainly due to unfounded COVID-19 fears. Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision, said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the driver’s explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital front liners. Days before this, a mob ganged up on and threw bleach all over the face of a front liner on his way to report for duty at a hospital in Tacurong City in Sultan Kudarat, while a medical technologist in Cagayan de Oro claimed that some public vehicles declined to let her board. Also last week in Cebu, two nurses were barred from entering the condominium where they were staying after they identified themselves as nurses. It has become a common experience shared by many of their colleagues across the country; health workers have found themselves evicted from eateries in Iloilo, turned away from their dormitories in Baguio, refused transport by tricycles in Cabanatuan City and Quezon City, and so on. Patients, too, are targeted. In a barangay in Tondo, a resident who tested positive was blocked from returning to his rented apartment. The health department’s order was for him to self-quarantine at home since he was asymptomatic, but the barangay’s residents barricaded the street and refused to let the ambulance through, despite a Manila councilor coming over to try to resolve the impasse. The patient, unable to return home to his parents who were elderly and thus at high-risk of contracting the disease, was forced to find temporary shelter in a hospital. Sometimes, all it takes is wild suspicion, and anyone can become an object of hostility and rejection. As GMA News reported last Monday, “A supermarket security guard lost both her rented apartment and her job after she went home one day and seemed to have been running a fever.” When a thermal scan showed her temperature to be above 36 degrees Celsius, she was told to go the hospital first and have herself checked. The hospital determined she had no fever, but when she got back to her apartment, she “found that her things had been gathered and placed in a garbage bag. She could no longer get inside.” The woman had to spend the night in a waiting shed.These are appalling and infuriating stories, showing the worst impulses that fear, panic, and ignorance can engender in ordinary people. It’s a welcome relief to hear that the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases has called on local government units to pass ordinances that will penalize acts of discrimination against COVID-19 front liners and patients, specifically following reports that the family of a patient in Iloilo who had died of COVID-19 was being harassed, their house pelted with stones by neighbors.“The IATF condemns these kinds of incidents and we are sternly issuing a warning that we will file cases against those who will commit acts of discrimination. I hope that the LGUs will respond by issuing an executive order or ordinance penalizing these,” said Cabinet Secretary and IATF-EID spokesperson Karlo Nograles.LGUs across the country can take their cue from city governments that have taken a stand for health workers and patients.The City of Manila, for example, passed on April 2 the Anti COVID-19 Discrimination Ordinance of 2020, which punishes persons who discriminate against patients infected with COVID-19 as well as health workers and emergency workers fighting the virus. Under the ordinance, it is unlawful for any person “to cause stigma, disgrace, shame, humiliation, harassment or otherwise discriminate against a person infected, under monitoring or investigation due to COVID-19, health worker or front liner,” and imposes on violators a fine of P5,000 or imprisonment of up to six months.The Cebu City government, meanwhile, has vowed to investigate acts of discrimination against health workers, beginning with the case of the two nurses refused entry into the condominium where they were temporarily staying.The contagion is bad enough; the lack of humanity and compassion toward front liners and patients makes it shamefully worse. That’s a far more lethal sickness that has to be  purged forthwith.​</a>

The Legend of Rice
Long ago, people did not plant crops or raise animals for food. The relied only on nature and their surroundings. They would live in places where they could find food. Some stayed in caves and lived on fruits and animal meat. Some stayed by riverbank and the sea so they could fish for their food. They would stay in a place until food got scarce and then move to another place where food was bountiful. The couple Banag and Danas belonged to a group who used to live near the sea. They were looking for a new place. A fierce storm had destroyed their houses near the sea. They feared the coming of another storm. “Why do we always move our home?” Banag asked Danas.” I am tired of this kind of life. We cannot even have children because we keep moving.” Banag wanted to separate from the rest of the group and stay behind in a pleasant place. “I want to bear our child there.” Danas gave in to his wife’s request. They chose a nice place in the mountains and built a simple house there. Their new home was tranquil, and food was bountiful. Nearby was a clear stream where Danas caught many fish. But then came a drought. For a long time, no rain fell, and the earth dried up. Plants and trees died, and birds and animals disappeared. Fish perished in the dried stream. Danas travelled far to look for food. But the drought was merciless. He traveled until he reached the next mountain. Still, he could not find food. Exhaustion caught up with Danas in the middle of the vast field. He lay among the grasses and fell asleep. Suddenly, the wind blew, and the grasses
danced and sang, Danas woke up surprised. Danas listened to the song of the grasses. “We are the hope of the people, Danas, gather our grains, our grains are good food.” Danas noticed the head of the grasses. Each head was full of golden grains. He picked a grain and bit it. “Pound our grains to remove their golden covers. “Sang the grasses.” Cook the white kernels inside the grains to soften them. It is good food. Danas gathered the grains until his bag was full and then hurriedly went home to Banag. “Now we have food,” he happily told Banag. He removed the golden covers of the grains, as the grasses had instructed him, cooked the grains and eat them. The next morning, Danas returned to the field, plant our grains “sang the grasses.” Plant them on land softened by rain. They will grow, and you will take care of them. When you harvest, save some grains to plant again. Learn to plant and take care of plants. Planting will become your source of livelihood.

                                            BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</a>

                            4. Read this article and write a critique using an appropriate approach and the appropriate format. Stop the Stigma Doctors, nurses, and other medical personnel are literally putting themselves in harm’s way to protect the greater Filipino population against COVID-19. And yet, in an alarming twist, an increasing number of them, instead of being accorded the hero’s treatment they deserve, are being subjected to discrimination, harassment, and violence, mainly due to unfounded COVID-19 fears. Last week, an ambulance driver was shot at inside a subdivision in Candelaria, Quezon. The suspect, who lived in the subdivision, said he thought the driver was transporting COVID-19 patients who may compromise the health of village residents, despite the driver’s explanation that he was transporting not patients but hospital front liners. Days before this, a mob ganged up on and threw bleach all over the face of a front liner on his way to report for duty at a hospital in Tacurong City in Sultan Kudarat, while a medical technologist in Cagayan de Oro claimed that some public vehicles declined to let her board. Also last week in Cebu, two nurses were barred from entering the condominium where they were staying after they identified themselves as nurses. It has become a common experience shared by many of their colleagues across the country; health workers have found themselves evicted from eateries in Iloilo, turned away from their dormitories in Baguio, refused transport by tricycles in Cabanatuan City and Quezon City, and so on. Patients, too, are targeted. In a barangay in Tondo, a resident who tested positive was blocked from returning to his rented apartment. The health department’s order was for him to self-quarantine at home since he was asymptomatic, but the barangay’s residents barricaded the street and refused to let the ambulance through, despite a Manila councilor coming over to try to resolve the impasse. The patient, unable to return home to his parents who were elderly and thus at high-risk of contracting the disease, was forced to find temporary shelter in a hospital. Sometimes, all it takes is wild suspicion, and anyone can become an object of hostility and rejection. As GMA News reported last Monday, “A supermarket security guard lost both her rented apartment and her job after she went home one day and seemed to have been running a fever.” When a thermal scan showed her temperature to be above 36 degrees Celsius, she was told to go the hospital first and have herself checked. The hospital determined she had no fever, but when she got back to her apartment, she “found that her things had been gathered and placed in a garbage bag. She could no longer get inside.” The woman had to spend the night in a waiting shed.These are appalling and infuriating stories, showing the worst impulses that fear, panic, and ignorance can engender in ordinary people. It’s a welcome relief to hear that the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF) for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases has called on local government units to pass ordinances that will penalize acts of discrimination against COVID-19 front liners and patients, specifically following reports that the family of a patient in Iloilo who had died of COVID-19 was being harassed, their house pelted with stones by neighbors.“The IATF condemns these kinds of incidents and we are sternly issuing a warning that we will file cases against those who will commit acts of discrimination. I hope that the LGUs will respond by issuing an executive order or ordinance penalizing these,” said Cabinet Secretary and IATF-EID spokesperson Karlo Nograles.LGUs across the country can take their cue from city governments that have taken a stand for health workers and patients.The City of Manila, for example, passed on April 2 the Anti COVID-19 Discrimination Ordinance of 2020, which punishes persons who discriminate against patients infected with COVID-19 as well as health workers and emergency workers fighting the virus. Under the ordinance, it is unlawful for any person “to cause stigma, disgrace, shame, humiliation, harassment or otherwise discriminate against a person infected, under monitoring or investigation due to COVID-19, health worker or front liner,” and imposes on violators a fine of P5,000 or imprisonment of up to six months.The Cebu City government, meanwhile, has vowed to investigate acts of discrimination against health workers, beginning with the case of the two nurses refused entry into the condominium where they were temporarily staying.The contagion is bad enough; the lack of humanity and compassion toward front liners and patients makes it shamefully worse. That’s a far more lethal sickness that has to be  purged forthwith.​</h2><br />

The Legend of Rice
Long ago, people did not plant crops or raise animals for food. The relied only on nature and their surroundings. They would live in places where they could find food. Some stayed in caves and lived on fruits and animal meat. Some stayed by riverbank and the sea so they could fish for their food. They would stay in a place until food got scarce and then move to another place where food was bountiful. The couple Banag and Danas belonged to a group who used to live near the sea. They were looking for a new place. A fierce storm had destroyed their houses near the sea. They feared the coming of another storm. “Why do we always move our home?” Banag asked Danas.” I am tired of this kind of life. We cannot even have children because we keep moving.” Banag wanted to separate from the rest of the group and stay behind in a pleasant place. “I want to bear our child there.” Danas gave in to his wife’s request. They chose a nice place in the mountains and built a simple house there. Their new home was tranquil, and food was bountiful. Nearby was a clear stream where Danas caught many fish. But then came a drought. For a long time, no rain fell, and the earth dried up. Plants and trees died, and birds and animals disappeared. Fish perished in the dried stream. Danas travelled far to look for food. But the drought was merciless. He traveled until he reached the next mountain. Still, he could not find food. Exhaustion caught up with Danas in the middle of the vast field. He lay among the grasses and fell asleep. Suddenly, the wind blew, and the grasses
danced and sang, Danas woke up surprised. Danas listened to the song of the grasses. “We are the hope of the people, Danas, gather our grains, our grains are good food.” Danas noticed the head of the grasses. Each head was full of golden grains. He picked a grain and bit it. “Pound our grains to remove their golden covers. “Sang the grasses.” Cook the white kernels inside the grains to soften them. It is good food. Danas gathered the grains until his bag was full and then hurriedly went home to Banag. “Now we have food,” he happily told Banag. He removed the golden covers of the grains, as the grasses had instructed him, cooked the grains and eat them. The next morning, Danas returned to the field, plant our grains “sang the grasses.” Plant them on land softened by rain. They will grow, and you will take care of them. When you harvest, save some grains to plant again. Learn to plant and take care of plants. Planting will become your source of livelihood.

Hetraveled until he reached the next mountain. Still he could not find food.Exhaustion caught up Danas in the middle of a vast field. He lay among the grasses and fell asleep.

Out grains are good food!" Danas noticed the head o the gains of the grasses. Each head was full of golden grains. He picked a grain and bit it." Pound our grains to remove their golden covers," sang the grasses, "cook the white kernels inside the grains to soften them. It is good food.Danas gathered the grains until his bag was full and the hurriedly went home to Banag "Now we have food," he happily told Banag. He removed the golden covers of the grains, the grasses had instructed him, cooked the grains, and then ate them.The next morning. Danas returned to the field, "plant our grains," sang the grasses. "Plant them on land softened by rain. They will grow, and will take care of them. When you harvest, save some grains to plant again, Learn to plant and take care of plants, Planting will become your source of livelihood,"Dances suddenly felt raindrops.

                            8. BUYER BEHAVIOUR AND RELATIONSHIP DEVELOPMENT RESEARCH COMPANY TRIES TO SHOW THAT YOU CAN ONLY UNDERSTAND CONSUMER BEHAVIOUR BY LIVING WITH THEIR BEHAVIOUR How can any marketer get inside your mind to understand how you actually make purchase decisions? Structured questionnaire surveys may have a role for collecting large scale factual data, but they have major weaknesses when it comes to understanding individuals' attitudes. Qualitative approaches, such as focus groups can get closer to the truth, but participants often still find themselves inhibited from telling the full story. Many marketing managers, especially those without large research budgets, inevitably end up relying on their own personal experiences to understand how consumers behave. This may be easy for target markets which are in the 20-40 age range (the age of typical marketers), but how do you get inside the mind of teenagers, or elderly people? Ethnographic approaches are becoming increasingly popular among marketers as a means of getting closer to the truth about consumer behaviour. Ethnographic research is nothing new, having been used by anthropologists in their study of the rituals of tribal people. Marketers have been relatively recent converts to the techniques of ethnography. The advertising agency BMP DDB has taken on board the techniques of ethnography in its "Project Keyhole" in a manner which is reminiscent of anthropologists' practice of living with tribes in order to understand them. Its consumer researchers live with a family for several days in order to record their every move. The project is designed to meet the needs of client companies who are looking for more than the data gathered using traditional quantitative and qualitative research techniques. Participants record their views and actions on a digital video camera, in the presence of a researcher who stays with them from 8am until 10pm for a few days.A normal project would last four or five days and the client may be invited along for part of the time. Participants are paid £100 for their troubles. What did they do with the direct mail when it came through the letter box? Did they use the coupon offer which it contained? Who drinks the fresh orange juice in the house? How long do they spend cooking dinner? How do they actually cook the ready-prepared meals they bought earlier? Does the family eat together? These are examples of the vital information that sponsoring companies hope to get hold of in order to position their products more effectively. According to the company, the advantage of this method over conventional research is that it picks up inconsistencies between what people say they are doing and what they actually do. Following them throughout the day allows the researcher to see why a person's habits might change according to random factors such as their mood, the time of day or the weather. Crucially it reveals the quirks in our behaviour that marketers are desperate to gain an insight into. For example, a person's store-card data might tell you that they buy bread and margarine, but it doesn't tell whether they eat the bread fresh, or toast it first before putting margarine on it. In 1998, the magazine Marketing put this novel research method to the test with a guinea pig family called the Jones's. It then compared the results of this approach with more traditional methods of profiling customers. In short, established systems such as CACI, Claritas and Experian might say one thing about the buying behaviour of a family, using lifestyle and electoral roll data, but did they bear any relation to reality? The information that the researcher gathered in a short space of time told a lot about the Jones family. By contrast, the database information about the Joneses, although detailed and often accurate, could not capture the quirks and details that make up the personality of the family. For example, it transpired that the Joneses had a keener than average eye on value for money. Although information on them from the four database companies correctly suggested that they enjoy luxuries like good food and foreign holidays, it didn't say anything about the real life factors that influence their purchasing decisions. The most noticeable of these was that although they like good food, Mrs Jones mixed her shopping between the supermarket and a local discount store which sells cut-price brands. This means that she only bought at Tesco or Sainsbury's what she could not get cheaper elsewhere. She showed the researcher a can of branded plum tomatoes which she got for 10p at the discount store as an example, explaining that it would have cost 26p in the supermarket. Mrs Jones prided herself on being able to hunt down bargains like this and occasionally rewarded herself by buying "something luxurious", such as smoked salmon from Marks &amp; Spencer. ​</h2><br />
