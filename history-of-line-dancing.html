Still I Rise Poem by Maya Angelou You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries? Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own backyard. You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. Raise your Flag Sung by KZ Tandingan What do you wanna be? Will you believe me if I tell you You can be anything you want? Where do you wanna go? Will you believe me if I tell you That you'll see the silver lining with your dreams? 'Cause when they say we can't, we have to be braver Together we'll reach for the impossible Even when you think that it's crazy The longest journey begins with a single step from you and me Raise your flag For the ones who think they can't get somewhere Raise your flag For the ones who think no one believes in them Raise your flag For the ones who already feel like giving up I stand here, not as one For we're all in this together Reach high and raise your flag Raise your flag Raise your flag, oh oh Raise your flag Don't ever let them put you down You're a fighter Never saying never And learn to lift each other up We'll be stronger If we get together, we'll be soaring even higherpls pasagot ng tamareport nonesense.​</a>

                                            DIRECTIONS: Read the paragraph carefully, observing context clues. Then, answer the questions which follow.1. Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities. Other amenities include an aero-circle (for Zumba and other group exercises), relaxing garden, children's playground, zoological corner, giant chess, elegant gazebo, seniors corner, and most of all sufficient and well-maintained restrooms. Which among the following statement does not support the above paragraph? ChooseThe People's Park has complete amenities for Valenzuelanos to spend their leisure time.School and community activities has a cultural stage for public viewing in the park.It has limited space and does not have state of the art attractions of modern parks other cities have.The Park reflects social awareness on the importance of nature and fun activities with the family.2. Based on the facts shared in those passages about the City's history and current LGU's performance and continued country wide recognition, an appreciative Valenzuela City resident normal response must be the following, less one which is: ChoosePromote the welfare of the City by being adherent to its call for responsible community living.Protect and conserve its historical and natural landmarks, as well as areas which are natural habitat for wildlife, like the endangered fowls/birds- bakaw-gabi.Promote and patronize the services and products made in Valenzuela.Draw graffiti on the walls of public places and destroy government properties where no CCTV's are installed.3.

The park which lies on the historical old town square of Polo, is adorned with hundred-year-old luscious trees, fountain, memorial marker commemorating war veterans and statues of Pio Valenzuela and Jose Rizal. The park signifies not only a place for relaxation but also marks the historical identity of the city. Creating greener spaces in sentence 1 means: ChooseHaving a unified green color paints on fences along city roadsSupporting local artists' graffiti art on public wallsPlanting and growing trees on city parks and officesCultivating garden vegetable4. Dubbed as Valenzuela City's "Best-kept Secret" , the Tagalag Fishing Village lies beside a1.3 kilometer boardwalk in Barangay Tagalag.

Still I Rise Poem by Maya Angelou You may write me down in history With your bitter, twisted lies, You may trod me in the very dirt But still, like dust, I'll rise. Does my sassiness upset you? Why are you beset with gloom? 'Cause I walk like I've got oil wells Pumping in my living room. Just like moons and like suns, With the certainty of tides, Just like hopes springing high, Still I'll rise. Did you want to see me broken? Bowed head and lowered eyes? Shoulders falling down like teardrops, Weakened by my soulful cries? Does my haughtiness offend you? Don't you take it awful hard 'Cause I laugh like I've got gold mines Diggin' in my own backyard. You may shoot me with your words, You may cut me with your eyes, You may kill me with your hatefulness, But still, like air, I'll rise. Does my sexiness upset you? Does it come as a surprise That I dance like I've got diamonds At the meeting of my thighs? Out of the huts of history's shame I rise Up from a past that's rooted in pain I rise I'm a black ocean, leaping and wide, Welling and swelling I bear in the tide. Leaving behind nights of terror and fear I rise Into a daybreak that's wondrously clear I rise Bringing the gifts that my ancestors gave. Raise your Flag Sung by KZ Tandingan What do you wanna be? Will you believe me if I tell you You can be anything you want? Where do you wanna go? Will you believe me if I tell you That you'll see the silver lining with your dreams? 'Cause when they say we can't, we have to be braver Together we'll reach for the impossible Even when you think that it's crazy The longest journey begins with a single step from you and me Raise your flag For the ones who think they can't get somewhere Raise your flag For the ones who think no one believes in them Raise your flag For the ones who already feel like giving up I stand here, not as one For we're all in this together Reach high and raise your flag Raise your flag Raise your flag, oh oh Raise your flag Don't ever let them put you down You're a fighter Never saying never And learn to lift each other up We'll be stronger If we get together, we'll be soaring even higherpls pasagot ng tamareport nonesense.​</h2><br />

The term pansori is derived from the Korean words pan and sori, the latter of which means "sound." However, pan has multiple meanings, and scholars disagree on the intended meaning when the term is coined.</p>Khon<p>Khon is a dance drama genre from Thailand. Khon has been performed since the Ayutthaya Kingdom. It is traditionally performed solely in the royal court by men in masks accompanied by narrators and a traditional piphat ensemble. A variation of this genre with female performers is called khon phu ying.</p>Sanskrit Theatre<p>Sanskrit Theatre is part of Sanskrit literature, the classical literature of India, which flourished from about 1500 BC to about AD 1100. The earliest extant critical work on Sanskrit drama is attributed to Bharata, the legendary formulator of dramatic art in India.</p>Khayal Al-zill<p>The name Khayal al-zill was an intentionally metaphorical term whose meaning is best translated as "shadows of the imagination" or "shadows of fancy," with implications that reinforced the allegorical nature of the stories.</p><br />

Valenzuela City People's Park is an urban park located in a 1.3 hectare lot beside the city hall in Barangay Karuhatan. An electronically controlled dancing fountain is an awesome, Instagramable sight at the park entrance. It prides of its 400-seater amphitheater, venue for a wide range of cultural activities.
