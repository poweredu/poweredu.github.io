                                            Atlantis—A Lost SonnetEavan Boland - 1944-2020How on earth did it happen, I used to wonderthat a whole city—arches, pillars, colonnades, not to mention vehicles and animals—had all one fine day gone under?I mean, I said to myself, the world was small then.Surely a great city must have been missed?I miss our old city —white pepper, white pudding, you and I meeting under fanlights and low skies to go home in it. Maybe what really happened is this: the old fable-makers searched hard for a wordto convey that what is gone is gone forever and never found it. And so, in the best traditions of where we come from, they gave their sorrow a nameand drowned it.Activity #: 1 1. Analyze the poem and explain the meaning per stanza. 2.

"Locked Away"
by R. City feat. Adam Levine
If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
Right about now.
If a judge for life me,
Would you stay by my side?
Or is ya gonna say good-bye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life,
Shorty, would it be alright?
Come and show me that you are down
(ah-ha)
Now tell me would you really ride for me?
(would you really ride for me?)
Baby, tell me would you die for me?
(tell me would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me?
(what's up?)
Would you be there to always hold me down?
Tell me would you really cry for me?
(would you really cry for me?)
Baby, don't lie to me.
(baby, don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything,
(what's up?)
I wanna know would you stick around?
If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?

When I say that, I mean by emotionally, spiritually and much it has nothing to do with you? A true friend is like a mirror. Do you know why ? its when more. a true the same way you're feeling too. People nowadays, in this modern life have lost sight of what have similarities but they also have their differences. The key to opening up the world of friendship and love is. Friends do not have to be exactly the same, I mean, friends do friendship is not just to focus on the similarities but to accept each other's faults because true friends do not judge each other. Friends love unconditionally. They do have their little angry long moments from time find but once you've found them, don't let them go because not everyone has true friends even friends because it's wonderful to be with such amazing friends. if they're popular and famous. I hope all of you as my audience get the true meaning of friends because it's wonderful to be with such amazing friends ​</a>

Maybe what really happened is this: the old fable-makers searched hard for a wordto convey that what is gone is gone forever and never found it. And so, in the best traditions of where we come from, they gave their sorrow a nameand drowned it.Activity #: 1 1. Analyze the poem and explain the meaning per stanza. 2.

                            13. plsss do answer analyse the inferential meanings deducible from the pieces of discourse below: Indicate the linguistic and contextual cues that warrant such inferences.a).Kemi:I was in courtship with him for two years. i quit when i get him of his true character.   Bimpe: Are you saying I shouldn't marry       him?   Kemi: Why should I say that?b).Segun: i am the best footballer in my team.     Akin: isn't that obvious with the penalty kick you lost last night?c)." I saw her dash across the road, fear written all over her. I was about approaching her when i saw him at the balcony with a big stick. Oh!they are at it again!"​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>A) Inference:Linguistic Cues: In the first piece of discourse, Kemi's use of the phrase "true character" implies that the person she was in courtship with was not behaving in a way that was expected of him. In the second piece of discourse, Segun's use of the phrase "best footballer" and Akin's response can be interpreted as Segun making an overconfident claim that is contradicted by the results of his performance. In the third piece of discourse, the narrator's description of "fear written all over her" and the sight of the person with a "big stick" implies that the woman is in danger.Contextual Cues: The contextual cues for the first piece of discourse are the conversation between Kemi and Bimpe, which suggests that Bimpe is considering marriage and is asking Kemi for advice. The contextual cues for the second piece of discourse are the mention of a penalty kick and the results of Segun's performance, which suggests that Segun is boasting about his skills despite his failure in the penalty kick. The contextual cues for the third piece of discourse are the narrator's observation of the woman running in fear and the person with a big stick, which suggests that the woman is in an abusive relationship.<strong>a</strong>) Kemi is implying that Bimpe should not marry the person Kemi was in a relationship with because Kemi knows their true character. This is inferred from Kemi's statement about quitting the relationship because of the person's true character and Bimpe's response asking if Kemi is saying she shouldn't marry the person.<strong>b</strong>) Akin is implying that Segun is not the best footballer in the team because of the penalty kick he lost last night. This is inferred from Segun's statement about being the best footballer and Akin's response mentioning the penalty kick.<strong>c</strong>) The speaker is implying that the person they saw running across the road is in danger because the speaker saw fear on their face and someone else with a weapon on the balcony. This is inferred from the description of the person running across the road with fear and the mention of someone else with a weapon on the balcony.___________________________<p><strong>Have </strong><strong>a </strong><strong>great </strong><strong>day</strong><strong>!</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

"Locked Away"
by R. City feat. Adam Levine
If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
Right about now.
If a judge for life me,
Would you stay by my side?
Or is ya gonna say good-bye?
Can you tell me right now?
If I couldn't buy you the fancy things in life,
Shorty, would it be alright?
Come and show me that you are down
(ah-ha)
Now tell me would you really ride for me?
(would you really ride for me?)
Baby, tell me would you die for me?
(tell me would you die for me?)
Would you spend your whole life with me?

Would you be there to always hold me down?
Tell me would you really cry for me?
(would you really cry for me?)
Baby, don't lie to me.
(baby, don't lie to me)
If I didn't have anything,
(what's up?)
I wanna know would you stick around?
If I got locked away,
And we lost it all today,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
If I showed you my flaws,
If I couldn't be strong,
Tell me honestly,
Would you still love me the same?
