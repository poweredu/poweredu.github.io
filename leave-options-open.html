                                            The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</a>

                                            X was the disbursing officer of the Ternate Beach Project of the Philippine Tourism in Cavite. In the morning of July 1, 2018, a Friday, he went to Manila to encash a check covering the wages of the employees. However, the processing of the check was delayed and was completed at about 3 p.m. Nevertheless, he decided to encash the check because the employees would be waiting for their pay the following day; otherwise, the workers would have to wait until july 5, the earliest time, when the main office would open. At that time, he had two choices: (1) return to Ternate, Cavite that same afternoon and arrive early evening; or (2) take the money with him to his house in Marilao, Bulacan, spend the night there, and leave for Ternate the following day. He chose the second option, thinking it was the safer one. Thus, at past 3 p.m., he took a passenger jeep bound for Bulacan. While the jeep was on EDSA, the jeep was held up and the money kept by X was taken. X chased the robbers and caught up with one robber who was subsequently charged with robbery and pleaded guilty. The other robber who held the stolen money escaped. The Commission on Audit found X negligent because he had not brought the cash proceeds of the check to his office in Ternate, Cavite for safekeeping, which is the normal procedure in the handling of funds. Is X liable? Why? State briefly the rule or reason for your answer.

                            10. The World is an Apple by Alberto S. Florentino Posted on November 18, 2011 by nicksiemouse The World is an Apple is a clear example of a Marxist literature. We can see different ideologies and class systems that affect human behavior. Classicism is distinctly seen in the text, when Gloria emphasized to Mario that he should've not tried to bring home an apple because they are not rich. Gloria has this belief that since they are poor they should not be aspiring for better things. She believed that they could only have things that are allotted for the poor (eg. Lugaw). Injustice is also evident in the text, just by stealing a single apple, Mario was fired out of his work. This points me to Economic Power. The company where Mario worked was just waiting for him to make mistakes. In this way they can throw men out without any reason and replace them with whom they know or whom they want. This shows how status and power works in our society. Mario can't even complain because whatever he does these people who have the authority will always win. Religion is also reflected in the text. Gloria has this belief that God will provide for them if they only believe and pray. She even pointed out that the financial crisis they are experiencing at the moment is only a challenge by God. And that God will never leave them. Rugged individualism is seen in the character of Pablo, wherein he lures Mario to steal for a living. Pablo doesn't think of what might happen to Mario if he comes with him. Economic conditions and material circumstances mostly are reasons why the poor are easily lured to commit illegal acts. That is how Pablo or the wealthy people manipulate the poor. Pablo even said to Gloria to take the money as a gift, since they cannot afford to pay for it. Pablo is showing not what his money can do for Tita but what social status he is in. Consumerism is also seen in the text when Pablo flaunts his money. He brags at Gloria that before, Mario can do many things. He experienced a life of wealth. Poverty is the main reason why Mario considers stealing as an option to make money. Manipulation of Pablo is also a factor that affects Mario's decisions. The text somehow invites us to condemn and criticize socio- economic forces. It tries to open our eyes in the reality that the poor have nothing to say because they are forced to be submissive with those who are in power. The text also shows how poor people, who only believe that God will help them, struggle in their everyday living. How little food they eat, malnutrition happens, and above all unemployment rates increase. Their only hope is religion- God. They still cling to the belief that God will provide for them and that they should be contented with what they have. In my opinion, there is a conflict in the function of religion in the text. Religion is the ideology that states that people should be satisfied. Religion is revealed in the text but it is used to persuade Mario not to commit illegal acts. Religion in the text also gives us the lesson that problems cannot be solved in a bad way. Aside from religion there are no other conflicts that I saw in the text. The World is an Apple evidently shows how the poor struggle in order to survive their everyday living and yet suffer for the injustices in our society.help me with this pls need introduction, summary, critical, and conclusion ​</h2><br />

                            14. X was the disbursing officer of the Ternate Beach Project of the Philippine Tourism in Cavite. In the morning of July 1, 2018, a Friday, he went to Manila to encash a check covering the wages of the employees. However, the processing of the check was delayed and was completed at about 3 p.m. Nevertheless, he decided to encash the check because the employees would be waiting for their pay the following day; otherwise, the workers would have to wait until july 5, the earliest time, when the main office would open. At that time, he had two choices: (1) return to Ternate, Cavite that same afternoon and arrive early evening; or (2) take the money with him to his house in Marilao, Bulacan, spend the night there, and leave for Ternate the following day. He chose the second option, thinking it was the safer one. Thus, at past 3 p.m., he took a passenger jeep bound for Bulacan. While the jeep was on EDSA, the jeep was held up and the money kept by X was taken. X chased the robbers and caught up with one robber who was subsequently charged with robbery and pleaded guilty. The other robber who held the stolen money escaped. The Commission on Audit found X negligent because he had not brought the cash proceeds of the check to his office in Ternate, Cavite for safekeeping, which is the normal procedure in the handling of funds. Is X liable? Why? State briefly the rule or reason for your answer.
