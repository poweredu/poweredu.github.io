                                            Write True if the statement is correct, if it is false write the correct answer 1. One of the most salient skill needed in critical reading is to identify explicit and implicit information in a text to evaluate the claims of the author 2. With explicit information, the text is directly stated, written and explained so that the reader will not be disoriented 3. Implicit information is understood suggested and implied indirectly 4. in Implicit information you have to read between the lines first and look for clues or hints to make an inference 5. Whenever you read something you have to examine the writer's stand or position regarding the chosen topic 6. Claims are not questions 7. Claims are usually found in the introduction or in the first few paragraphs of the text 8. An apple a day keeps the doctor away is an example of claim 9. 4 out of 5 dentists recommend Trident is an example of claim 10. Claims usually fall into one of these three types: claims of fact, claims of value, and claims of policy​</a>

                            4. Part C – Write foreign policy proposal.
Write your report to the government of Karmin in the form of a three-paragraph essay. Use this rubric to guide your response. Be sure to answer the following questions:
1. What do you think your country's foreign policy goals should be? Do you want to gain power and influence overseas or simply protect your sovereignty? Explain why you think these goals are appropriate, using historical examples.
2. Should the country align itself with NATO, the Warsaw Pact, or the Unaligned Movement? Explain your answer, using historical examples.
3. However the country chooses to align itself, what type of foreign policy should it have toward the rest of the world? Should it be more aggressive or more diplomatic? Explain your answer, using historical examples.
pls answer asap</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>As a country, Karmin's foreign policy goals should primarily focus on protecting its sovereignty and security while also promoting economic growth and stability. This can be achieved through a combination of diplomatic and military means, as well as through economic and trade agreements. Historically, countries that have prioritized their own security and economic prosperity have been able to maintain stability and prosperity for their citizens.In terms of alliances, Karmin should align itself with the Unaligned Movement. This will allow the country to maintain its independence and autonomy in decision-making while also allowing it to form partnerships and alliances on a case-by-case basis. Historically, non-aligned countries have been able to navigate the complexities of international relations more effectively as they are not bound by the constraints of a specific alliance.In terms of foreign policy towards the rest of the world, Karmin should adopt a balanced approach that combines elements of both diplomacy and assertiveness. This approach will enable the country to engage with other nations on a wide range of issues, from trade and economic cooperation to security and defense. However, it is important for the country to be prepared to defend its interests when necessary. This type of foreign policy has been shown to be effective in the past, as demonstrated by countries that have been able to maintain good relations with other nations while also effectively defending their own interests.<p></p><br />

One of the most salient skill needed in critical reading is to identify explicit and implicit information in a text to evaluate the claims of the author 2. With explicit information, the text is directly stated, written and explained so that the reader will not be disoriented 3. Implicit information is understood suggested and implied indirectly 4. in Implicit information you have to read between the lines first and look for clues or hints to make an inference 5. Whenever you read something you have to examine the writer's stand or position regarding the chosen topic 6. Claims are not questions 7. Claims are usually found in the introduction or in the first few paragraphs of the text 8. An apple a day keeps the doctor away is an example of claim 9. 4 out of 5 dentists recommend Trident is an example of claim 10.
