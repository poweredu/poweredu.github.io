I remember that I signed for the package that was delivered at exactly 3:23 pm. I was distraught! I decided to search the kitchen for clues to find out who stole my scrumptious cookie.

I continued to search further and found a tennis ball, just around the corner. It had chocolate chip cookie Crumbs on it! Who would have dropped short brown hairs on the floor and left Crumbs on a tennis ball? There was a trail of crumbs leading toward the back door, which was open. The crumbs led down the back stairs and onto the grass. As I followed the trail.

I continued to search further and found a tennis ball, just around the corner. It had chocolate chip cookie Crumbs on it! Who would have dropped short brown hairs on the floor and left Crumbs on a tennis ball? There was a trail of crumbs leading toward the back door, which was open.
