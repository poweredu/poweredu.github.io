Pro forma statements can give you this information. Trends can also be used to calculate estimated earnings. Regression analysis can be used to estimate earnings by examining historical trends. <strong>Estimated earnings </strong>can also be determined via scenario analysis. To avoid drawing general conclusions, scenario analysis examines a variety of potential outcomes, from the worst case to the best case scenario. Estimate computations should take into account the situation of the entire economy. Giving weight to the general economy is one of several elements that can be included in scenario analysis.</p><p>Estimated earnings with profit margin formula:</p><p>[tex]Estimated Earnings= Projected sales x Projected Net Profit Margin[/tex]</p><p>     Since net profit margin equals net income divided by sales, the formula of predicted sales multiplied by projected net profit margin can be utilized.
