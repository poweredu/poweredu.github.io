                                            • In cosmological philosophies introduced by the pre-Socratic philosophers, man is conceived to be part of the physical world. In this physical world, there is natural cosmological laws functioning as to how the physical elements change from within. Within the change, everything is determined consequently. If the case is such so, is man still conceived as “free” being able to take and make change according to his will, rather than passively subjected into the natural dynamics of this physical world?

Everything on Earth is influenced by gravity.2 The gravitational pull that each body feels gets stronger the closer they are to each other.3 Gravity and gravitation are the same.4. We can easily survive without gravity5 Gravity causes any two objects in the universe to be drawn to each other.6. Gravitation is a natural phenomenon by which all objects attract each other7. The sun's gravity has a greater effect on Earth tides than the moon's.8. Gravity greatly affects the convection process on Earth9. Objects always fall to the ground at the same time regardless of their mass and weight.10. When a person is in outer space, his weight changes​</h2><br />

                            30. Chapter 2 In life, nothing happens randomly or without a reason. Even those events that you consider tiny are all fully dependent on the laws of nature. Everything happens for a reason, and according to firm laws, do not allow randomness to dominate the universe. Boyle was so rich that he did all his research at his own expense. Despite his achievements in physics, his favorite subject was chemistry. He discovered that when the pressure changes on a certain amount of gas, its size is inversely proportional to the pressure, provided that the temperature is constant. As a student, what do you think should be constant in you in order to respond on the laws of nature?​</h2><br />
