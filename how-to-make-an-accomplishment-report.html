                                            Case Study 1A lady by the name of Diwata has been working in an insurance company for the last 5 years, joins a fast moving consumer goods company. She is a very bright prospect and does outstandingly well in her training period of one year and her colleagues during that period also vouch for that fact. After one year of training, she is given charge of a small territory in which she does very well and is again praised by her colleagues and supervisors alike. She is then given charge of a much larger territory after a few months. Her supervisor after a time complains to the senior management that Diwata has not been good at her job and is finding it difficult to handle her customers. Even the person in charge of overseeing Diwata's training personally, reports that she is not performing well. Diwata in turn complains that her job is going on perfectly well and if there are any complaints it's because she is being victimized in the male dominated atmosphere. The matter is then reported to the head office. REQUIRED: WHAT SHOULD HEAD OFFICE DO?Case Study 2Hughes Distributing Company, a southwestern distributor of health and beauty supplies is faced with a housekeeping problem in their receiving areas. On several visits to these departments, the plant engineer has found them cluttered with trash and empty cardboard shipping cartons. An examination of the receiving operations indicates that when a large shipment of material is received the items are removed from their shipping cartons and placed on racks. The empty cartons and packing materials are left on the floor. Periodically, or when the order unpackers cannot move, someone flattens and stacks these refuse materials.REQUIRED: SUGGEST A METHOD FOR REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THIS HOUSEKEEPING PROBLEMCase Study 3The Double Rite Bottling Company delivers soda to vending machines throughout the northern section of Rhode Island. The Company takes pride in the fact that all the beverages are sold in returnable bottles. The president of Double Rite feels it is his civic duty to help decrease the roadside trash that is often attributable to disposable beverage cans. The returned empty bottles are stored on the roof of the truck when the driver is making his deliveries. Upon returning to the warehouse after deliveries are made, a helper passes the empty cases from the roof of the truck to the driver standing on the ground. The driver then places the cases onto a conveyor. REQUIRED: HOW CAN THE HANDLING OF EMPTY CASES FROM THE ROOF OF THE TRUCK BE ACCOMPLISHED IN A MORE ECONOMICAL MANNER?l​</a>

                                            The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</a>

She is a very bright prospect and does outstandingly well in her training period of one year and her colleagues during that period also vouch for that fact. After one year of training, she is given charge of a small territory in which she does very well and is again praised by her colleagues and supervisors alike. She is then given charge of a much larger territory after a few months. Her supervisor after a time complains to the senior management that Diwata has not been good at her job and is finding it difficult to handle her customers. Even the person in charge of overseeing Diwata's training personally, reports that she is not performing well. Diwata in turn complains that her job is going on perfectly well and if there are any complaints it's because she is being victimized in the male dominated atmosphere. The matter is then reported to the head office. REQUIRED: WHAT SHOULD HEAD OFFICE DO?Case Study 2Hughes Distributing Company, a southwestern distributor of health and beauty supplies is faced with a housekeeping problem in their receiving areas. On several visits to these departments, the plant engineer has found them cluttered with trash and empty cardboard shipping cartons. An examination of the receiving operations indicates that when a large shipment of material is received the items are removed from their shipping cartons and placed on racks. The empty cartons and packing materials are left on the floor. Periodically, or when the order unpackers cannot move, someone flattens and stacks these refuse materials.REQUIRED: SUGGEST A METHOD FOR REDUCING OR ELIMINATING THIS HOUSEKEEPING PROBLEMCase Study 3The Double Rite Bottling Company delivers soda to vending machines throughout the northern section of Rhode Island. The Company takes pride in the fact that all the beverages are sold in returnable bottles.

                            23. The Law of Choice
Marian Leanna dela Cruz
1
”Cross my heart and hope to die!”
2
If you were an elementary school-age kid at any point in your life, you’d be familiar with the phrase above. These words get thrown around on playgrounds, school corridors, and street curbs more often than a Chinese jackstone or a basketball. You probably swore your own death several times as a child, just so you can prove a point to your playmate.
3
The fulfillment of morbid oaths aside, children instinctively know the relevance of keeping one’s promises. See little Juana going on at length about the Chickenjoy that her mother said she could have, if only she behaved during grocery shopping. See Junior hunched over a piece of bond paper, coloring materials spread around, finishing a drawing he said he will show his teacher the next day. Children hold promises dear, and thankfully, so do older people. Why must you do this, though.
4
One reason why people should fulfill promises is because it makes everyone involved feel good. You gain faith in your own ability to accomplish something, and others see you as a reliable person. For example, your shelves need arranging, and your mother pointed this out to you. If you tell her you’ll fix your shelves in an hour, actually accomplishing this will make both you and your mother happy. Not only because your shelves are tidier but because you were true to your word. Put this in contrast to the awful feeling of having nothing to show after the allocated time. Indeed, keeping your word will help you build your confidence and self-respect. When you are able to keep your promise, you convince yourself that you are able to handle a similar situation, should it come in the future.
5
Also, a promise can be seen as on-the-job training. Later in life, keeping promises will help you be professional at work. Most jobs have deadlines and project termination dates. If you are good at keeping promises, you would be able to come up with a service or a product before the deadline. Your employment relies heavily upon your performance, and meeting deadlines is just the start of it.
6
It must be said that a promise is, first and foremost, a choice. It is a personal decision to fulfill a promise, and as such, it is also a personal decision to break it. The reason why people fail to keep their promises sometimes is rooted here. According to psychologist and writer Farouk Radwan, you should consider three things when you are about to make a promise:
7
The first is self-understanding. You should be able to tell what things you are likely to enjoy doing, which ones are chores for you, and those which you absolutely cannot abide. “For example,” he writes, “If you don’t know that working under pressure is the last thing you would want to do in life you might promise your manager to finish all of your work in few hours, [then you might start feeling the pressure].” According to Radwan, if you understand how you work, you
will not make promises you cannot keep.
8
Related to the first is Ability If you do not know your own limitations, you might take on projects that you are not able to finish. For instance, if you offer to have all 3000 pages of your report photocopied, and you find that you’re exhausted at the 1500-paper mark, then you have just discovered your personal photocopying limit (to the detriment of your group).
9
Finally, there is practicality Some things just cannot be accomplished, given the time frame. No matter how much you like doing something, or how proficient you are at it, if the external conditions (like time and place) are not right, you will not be able to fulfill your promise. For example, you would want to cash a check for your company, but you found out that the bank is closed. It doesn’t matter if you enjoy what you’re doing; fact is, no one will be able to attend to you
10
Choosing to make promises is a rewarding thing, if you are able to keep them. When you keep a promise, you are building not only others’ trust in you but your trust in your own capabilities. And when you keep a promise, in effect, you are telling the other person that they are important to you. As writer John Green said in The Fault in Our Stars, “Some people don’t understand the promises they’re making when they make them [...] but [they] keep the promise anyway. That’s what love is. Love is keeping the promise anyway.”</h2><br />

As a student how would you help your classmate understand the importance and functions of these multimedia resources to cope with the new learning environment?2. Which among these multimedia resources do you find the least functional and why? How would you change or improve it to serve your needs as a student in this new learning environment?3. A foreigner friend of your family wants to visit the Philippines after the pandemic. He wants to know the country's famous tourist spots like Boracay, the islands in Palawan etc. Choose an appropriate multimedia presentation that will make the foreigner visit the country. Show your output through the multimedia resource you chose.​​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>As a student, I can help my classmate to understand and be more knowledgeable about multimedia resources through providing my own knowledge and understanding about the resources that are needed in order to cope with the new learning environment. For example, educational websites. Only few students has access to it because these sites are still remain to be undiscovered. I can help my fellow students by giving them access to it through providing the knowledge about the importance, functions, and advantages of using these websites. To add, multimedia resources are very helpful when it comes to delivering lessons to the students especially in this new learning set-up. Thus, with my own understanding about multimedia resources, I can help my classmates to have an extended knowledge regarding the functions of these multimedia access.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
