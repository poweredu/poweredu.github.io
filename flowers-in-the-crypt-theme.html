                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>FLOWERS IN THE CRYPT</p><p>by Catherine Garcia Dario</p><p></p><p>(Part 4)</p><p></p><p>On April 19, 2008, I held Lolo for the last time. I remember standing above his pale, stiff cadaver as the man wiped his face with an acrid-smelling ointment. My mother insisted that the morgue was too heavy for a young girl like me, but I insisted on going. I wanted to know what it was like to look at a dead person enveloped inside a cold casket. I expected Lolo to open his eyes, sit up, stretch his arms and say, “That was a good nap!” while ambling out of the coffin with a glow on his face. It was a scary, bizarre idea and when I touched the icy coldness of his skin, I could not believe that I wanted it to happen. </p><p></p><p>My family told me to give him a eulogy. I declined. After watching Lola break down during the wake, I was afraid that the same thing would happen to me. I listened to my titos and titas recite speeches, quote poetry or movies that Lolo liked. Friends of his would come up to the podium and repeat themselves with: “Exequiel was a remarkable man” over and over again. I went home with the words generous and loving glued to my brain. My chest tightened as I thought about them.</p><p></p><p>The post-funeral events kept my family busy. Distant relatives would appear out of nowhere, carrying baskets of wine or fruit and sending in cards that read: “We offer our deepest comforts.” So many people came to the house to comfort my heartsick Lola, and I could not count the number of masses we attended; how many candles we lit; how many friends that told me that my Lolo was in a better place. I wondered if Lolo really went to heaven. When I saw the flowers hanging on the knob of his crypt, I knew that he did. </p><p></p><p>I was alone when I saw it. There hung a humble bouquet of baby’s breath that was so small and plain that it disappeared behind the extravagant flower arrangements that spelled out Lolo’s name. What drew me to it was the small card attached to the thin ribbon that held the flowers together. There were names written on it—the names of Lolo’s other children. Below theirs was Remedios’ signature. Remedios—the woman who did not come to Lolo’s funeral, the woman wom he had four children with, the woman Lolo loved. </p><p></p><p>In that moment, I could see Remedios pacing restlessly by her phone, waiting for somebody to call the moment Lolo got his stroke. I could imagine her hysterical in the arms of her children, begging to see him as his brain engorged its memories away. And I could imagine her sneaking timidly into the crypt; attaching the flowers to the knob and slipping away before anybody could see her. Remedios mourned alone. </p><p>I could have pulled out the flower, torn them up like her cocktail dress and her letters and her pictures. But I could only think of Lolo, how he carried his other children the way he carried me as I balanced gingerly on his shoulders when he walked me down the shore. How he pointed out the horizon, teased me for being scared, and said, “You can try to swim so far and never touch the sun,”—I realized that it was not because Lolo did not know how to love, but it was because he loved too much. I left the flowers there, retreating back to the pew as my family lit more candles and prayed. I thought of his father walking out the door, the Japanese soldiers tugging at his sisters’ hair; his nonchalant mother smoking on the porch. It was then when I stood up, joined my family and prayed.</p><br />

                            27. what is the experience of the author of the story of the" flowers in the crypt"</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:Tales from the Crypt was an American bi-monthly horror comic anthology series published by EC Comics from 1950 to 1955, producing 27 issues (the first issue with the title was #20, previously having been International Comics (#1-#5); International Crime Patrol (#6); Crime Patrol (#7-#16) and The Crypt of Terror (#17-#19) for a total of 46 issues in the series). Along with its sister titles, The Haunt of Fear and The Vault of Horror, Tales from the Crypt was popular, but in the late 1940s and early 1950s comic books came under attack from parents, clergymen, schoolteachers and others who believed the books contributed to illiteracy and juvenile delinquency. In April and June 1954, highly publicized congressional subcommittee hearings on the effects of comic books upon children left the industry shaken. With the subsequent imposition of a highly restrictive Comics Code, EC Comics publisher Bill Gaines cancelled Tales from the Crypt and its two companion horror titles, along with the company's remaining crime and science fiction series in September 1954. All EC titles have been reprinted at various times since their demise, and stories from the horror series have been adapted for television and film. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:this is the story of Exequiel Garcia. At his very young age, his mother had an affair that caused the fightings of his parents. Sadly, he got to see the fightings every time. As time passed by, Exequiel had a chance to study in Manila and he became a businessman and settled down(got married).</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            30. An analysis of the story "flowers in the crypt" by Catherina Garcia Darion</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>"FLOWER IN THE CRYPT" BY CATHERINE GARCIA DARIO</strong></p><p><strong>Settings</strong></p><p><strong>WHAT</strong> - The Story discusses the life from his youth up to the time he got married.</p><p><strong>WHEN</strong> - "Sixty years ago On April 19, 2008"</p><p><strong>WHERE</strong> - House in Antipolo, Home in Bataan, University.</p><p></p><p><strong>Plot </strong></p><p><strong>INTRODUCTION </strong>- The author's grandfather is named Exequiel Garcia. He grew up watching very frequent fights between his parents. It is because there was an affair with his mother. He went to study in Manila. He wrote poems and sold them to his classmates who were interested in impressing their prospects. Exequiel became an entrepreneur and got married.</p><p><strong>RISING ACTION</strong><strong> </strong>- They had three children which included Catherine Garcia Dario's mother. His grandfather Exequiel Garcia, however, had a longstanding affair with his secretary Remedios. Because of that, Catherine Garcia Dario despised her grandfather.</p><p><strong>CLIMAX</strong><strong> </strong>- I was eleven years old when he got a stroke. The phone call at two in the morning informed us that Lolo had collapsed in his apartment and suffered multiple seizures. The CT scan showed that his brain had several distensions and swelled up his skull like a balloon. I did not shed the lightest tear, not even after he slipped into a coma. When the drugs had seeped in and he finally opened his eyes, he was no longer Lolo. He was a vegetable. He lived for two more years.</p><p><strong>FALLING ACTION</strong><strong> </strong>- After months in Medical City, we transferred him back to his apartment in Makati. My mother converted his bedroom into a hospital ward, and soon the curtains smelled like antiseptic, and the drone of the lifeline monitor filled our ears. I hated visiting him, and I fabricated stories so that I wouldn't have to go:</p><p>piles of homework, a migraine, "Sorry, I think I have practice for the school play." I grew numb to the weeping of my family. Lolo was a shell, and so was I. Exequiel Garcia died on April 19, 2008.</p><p><strong>RESOLUTION</strong> - Remedios never visited him in the hospital. However, on his grandfather's crypt, she saw flowers with a card sent by Remedios.</p><p><strong>POINT OF VIEW</strong> - The POV of the story is 3rd person because of the pronouns, “he, “she”, “it”, or "they". For example, in the story "SHE was not there when they wrapped up his body and wheeled him to the morgue, nor was SHE at his wake when each of us bent to kiss the cold,</p><p>pallid, forehead."</p><p><strong>THEME</strong> - The theme of the story is about forgiveness. The protagonist felt some kind of resentment towards his grandfather because of his love affair with another woman, named Remedios, as described and seen in the story. But as the plot progressed, we can see the character growth of the protagonist - how she came to recognize the side of Remedios by putting herself in her shoes.</p><br />
