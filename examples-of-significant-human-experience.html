                                            Heads of state and global health leaders today made an unprecedented commitment to work together to accelerate the development and production of new vaccines, tests and treatments for COVID-19 and assure equitable access worldwide.The COVID-19 pandemic has already affected more than 2.4 million people, killing over 160,000. It is taking a huge toll on families, societies, health systems and economies around the world, and for as long as this virus threatens any country, the entire world is at risk. There is an urgent need, therefore, while following existing measures to keep people physically distanced and to test and track all contacts of people who test positive, for innovative COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.“We will only halt COVID-19 through solidarity,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Countries, health partners, manufacturers, and the private sector must act together and ensure that the fruits of science and research can benefit everybody.”Work has already started. Since January, WHO has been working with researchers from hundreds of institutions to develop and test vaccines, standardize assays and standardize regulatory approaches on innovative trial designs and define criteria to prioritize vaccine candidates.  The Organization has prequalified diagnostics that are being used all over the world, and more are in the pipeline. And it is coordinating a global trial to assess the safety and efficacy of four therapeutics against COVID-19.The challenge is to speed up and harmonize processes to ensure that once products are deemed safe and effective, they can be brought to the billions of people in the world who need them. Past experience, in the early days of HIV treatment, for example, and in the deployment of vaccines against the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, shows that even when tools are available, they have not been equally available to all.So today leaders came together at a virtual event, co-hosted by the World Health Organization, the President of France, the President of the European Commission, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The event was joined by the UN Secretary General, the AU Commission Chairperson, the G20 President, heads of state of France, South Africa, Germany, Vietnam, Costa Rica, Italy, Rwanda, Norway, Spain, Malaysia and the UK (represented by the First Secretary of State).Health leaders from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), GAVI-the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund, UNITAID, the Wellcome Trust, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IFRC), the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA), the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers’ Network (DCVMN), and the International Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (IGBA) committed to come together, guided by a common vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of COVID-19, to launch this groundbreaking collaboration. They are joined by two Special Envoys:  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Gavi Board Chair and Sir Andrew Witty, former CEO of GlaxoSmithKline.They pledged to work towards equitable global access based on an unprecedented level of partnership. They agreed to create a strong unified voice, to build on past experience and to be accountable to the world, to communities and to one another.“Our shared commitment is to ensure all people have access to all the tools to prevent, detect, treat and defeat COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros. “No country and no organization can do this alone. The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator brings together the combined power of several organizations to work with speed and scale.”Health leaders called on the global community and political leaders to support this landmark collaboration and for donors to provide the necessary resources to accelerate achievement of its objectives, capitalizing on the opportunity provided by a forthcoming pledging initiative that starts on 4 May 2020. This initiative, spearheaded by the European Union, aims to mobilize the significant resources needed to accelerate the work towards protecting the world from COVID-19when was it published?​</a>

Your song!Direction: Read the statements below and compose a song which the lyrics are literally, discussing what you understand."The actualization of human being in all his/her learning is what we called culture. This idea is the overall concept about the new topic. As the lesson presented, it will give you the meaning of culture like the following:1. Culture refers to a group or community which shares common experiences that shape the way its members understand the world. It includes groups that we are born into, such as race, national origin,16gender, class, or religion. It can also include a group we join orbecome part of.2. Culture is a strong part of people's lives. It influences their views, values, humor, hopes, loyalties, worries and fears. It helps to have some perspective and understanding of their cultures.3. Culture and society defined, culture consists of the beliefs, behaviors,objects, and other characteristics common to the members of aparticular group or society.4. Through culture, people and groups define themselves, conform tosociety's shared values, and contribute to society.5. The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values,and artifacts.a. A symbol is anything that is used to stand for something else. People who share a culture often attach a specific meaning to an object, gesture, sound, or image. For example, a cross is a significant symbol to Christians.

                                            The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</a>

                            4. Heads of state and global health leaders today made an unprecedented commitment to work together to accelerate the development and production of new vaccines, tests and treatments for COVID-19 and assure equitable access worldwide.The COVID-19 pandemic has already affected more than 2.4 million people, killing over 160,000. It is taking a huge toll on families, societies, health systems and economies around the world, and for as long as this virus threatens any country, the entire world is at risk. There is an urgent need, therefore, while following existing measures to keep people physically distanced and to test and track all contacts of people who test positive, for innovative COVID-19 vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.“We will only halt COVID-19 through solidarity,” said Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. “Countries, health partners, manufacturers, and the private sector must act together and ensure that the fruits of science and research can benefit everybody.”Work has already started. Since January, WHO has been working with researchers from hundreds of institutions to develop and test vaccines, standardize assays and standardize regulatory approaches on innovative trial designs and define criteria to prioritize vaccine candidates.  The Organization has prequalified diagnostics that are being used all over the world, and more are in the pipeline. And it is coordinating a global trial to assess the safety and efficacy of four therapeutics against COVID-19.The challenge is to speed up and harmonize processes to ensure that once products are deemed safe and effective, they can be brought to the billions of people in the world who need them. Past experience, in the early days of HIV treatment, for example, and in the deployment of vaccines against the H1N1 outbreak in 2009, shows that even when tools are available, they have not been equally available to all.So today leaders came together at a virtual event, co-hosted by the World Health Organization, the President of France, the President of the European Commission, and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. The event was joined by the UN Secretary General, the AU Commission Chairperson, the G20 President, heads of state of France, South Africa, Germany, Vietnam, Costa Rica, Italy, Rwanda, Norway, Spain, Malaysia and the UK (represented by the First Secretary of State).Health leaders from the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), GAVI-the Vaccine Alliance, the Global Fund, UNITAID, the Wellcome Trust, the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement (IFRC), the International Federation of Pharmaceutical Manufacturers (IFPMA), the Developing Countries Vaccine Manufacturers’ Network (DCVMN), and the International Generic and Biosimilar Medicines Association (IGBA) committed to come together, guided by a common vision of a planet protected from human suffering and the devastating social and economic consequences of COVID-19, to launch this groundbreaking collaboration. They are joined by two Special Envoys:  Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala, Gavi Board Chair and Sir Andrew Witty, former CEO of GlaxoSmithKline.They pledged to work towards equitable global access based on an unprecedented level of partnership. They agreed to create a strong unified voice, to build on past experience and to be accountable to the world, to communities and to one another.“Our shared commitment is to ensure all people have access to all the tools to prevent, detect, treat and defeat COVID-19,” said Dr Tedros. “No country and no organization can do this alone. The Access to COVID-19 Tools Accelerator brings together the combined power of several organizations to work with speed and scale.”Health leaders called on the global community and political leaders to support this landmark collaboration and for donors to provide the necessary resources to accelerate achievement of its objectives, capitalizing on the opportunity provided by a forthcoming pledging initiative that starts on 4 May 2020. This initiative, spearheaded by the European Union, aims to mobilize the significant resources needed to accelerate the work towards protecting the world from COVID-19when was it published?​</h2><br />

Culture refers to a group or community which shares common experiences that shape the way its members understand the world. It includes groups that we are born into, such as race, national origin,16gender, class, or religion. It can also include a group we join orbecome part of.2.

Culture and society defined, culture consists of the beliefs, behaviors,objects, and other characteristics common to the members of aparticular group or society.4. Through culture, people and groups define themselves, conform tosociety's shared values, and contribute to society.5. The major elements of culture are symbols, language, norms, values,and artifacts.a. A symbol is anything that is used to stand for something else. People who share a culture often attach a specific meaning to an object, gesture, sound, or image. For example, a cross is a significant symbol to Christians. It is not simply two pieces of wood attached to each other, nor is it just an old object of torture and execution. To Christians, it represents the basis of their entire religion, and they have great reverence for the symbol.b. Language is a system of words and symbols used to communicate with other people. This includes full languages as we usually think of them, such as English, Spanish, French, etc. but, it also includes body language, slang, and common phrases that are unique to certain groups of people.C. Systems of values are culturally defined standards for what is good or desirable. Members of the culture use the shared system of values to decide what is good and what is bad."​</h2><br />

                            18. The beliefs, values and ideas of religious traditions have made, and continue to make, significant contributions to the development of human societies and cultures. Religious belief systems articulate responses to questions relating to human nature, identity and purpose, and urge believers to embrace the imperative to live ethical lives. In essence, religions provide a frame of reference for understanding the world and for guiding personal and communal action. This course investigates what religion is and what role religion plays in the lives of individuals in society; how religious traditions respond to the human search for meaning, the place of religion in Australian society including indigenous spirituality before and after European settlement; what citizenship is and what the rights and responsibilities are for all citizens; and develops an appreciation for forms of religious expression. In a world where global travel and work is a real possibility, learners will gain knowledge and understanding of how religious traditions affect cultural values and practices, social, political and economic institutions, as well as an understanding of how religious traditions find expression in the arts, theatre, cinema, media, and literature. The perspective of lived faith is also examined. In this way, learners will identify and understand the worldviews of followers of religious traditions. The study of Religion in Society provides an avenue for learners to develop an appreciation of the way that religion influences our lives as members of a particular society and provides them with the skills to be informed and critical thinking members of their society. It values and promotes open inquiry and respect and tolerance for all religious traditions and draws on personal and collective stories and experiences as examples of authentic and lived religion. write an reaction about this article​</h2><br />

It is in fact, important to preserve religion, and it signifies the strength of faith and devotion that people have had throughout the past years. Religion has been around for decades in the human race but that doesn't mean it will end sooner or later because it plays an important role in the development of early civilization. </p><br />
