DISCUSSION
Opinions about many things could lead to a lot of fallacies. Highly opinionated superstar could
influence a lot of people. Sometimes this movie stars promote illegal drugs which could make a lot of young
people follow their idol. Like the use of Marijuana for example, some people promote them but authorities in
many countries that its negative effect out weight the positive effect. So to say that Marijuana is good for the
health this remains an opinion.

                                            For conventional drawing or painting, artists have always been concerned with creating the impression of room or depth on a flat surface. They use the effects of a single point of view and/or light and shadow to create this illusion— or they can deliberately distort these elements to make abstractions, as in the Cubist style. In conventional sculpture, space is explored in terms of both positive and negative space. The next element of art is the so – called Space. What is space by the way? How is space used for sculpture? Why is the room depicted in painting? Why is space different from space in life in art?Many contemporary artists deal with space by concentrating on real space— the dimensions of a house, the spaces that we travel through in the city or in the natural world, the boundless spaces of the sky or the virtual space of the Internet. We work with fine-art or industrial materials— from wood and stone to steel and plastic— to frame space or to create space-filling work. Materials such as electrical lighting, film, video, or digital media can also transform, document, or create space. Viewers may be surrounded by art, or they can contribute to a concentrated experience or a perception of a real space. When an artist creates a piece of work for a room or a specific space, it is called installation art. Most installations are temporary and often require multiple senses, such as sight, sound and smell.​</a>

This study examined the relationship of book and e-book, this paper tends to identify in 1 affects reading comprehension. Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant. The best way for use of concept maps is teacher-generated concept maps with texts.pahelp plesss ​</a>

DISCUSSION
Opinions about many things could lead to a lot of fallacies. Highly opinionated superstar could
influence a lot of people. Sometimes this movie stars promote illegal drugs which could make a lot of young
people follow their idol. Like the use of Marijuana for example, some people promote them but authorities in
many countries that its negative effect out weight the positive effect. So to say that Marijuana is good for the
health this remains an opinion.

                            9. For conventional drawing or painting, artists have always been concerned with creating the impression of room or depth on a flat surface. They use the effects of a single point of view and/or light and shadow to create this illusion— or they can deliberately distort these elements to make abstractions, as in the Cubist style. In conventional sculpture, space is explored in terms of both positive and negative space. The next element of art is the so – called Space. What is space by the way? How is space used for sculpture? Why is the room depicted in painting? Why is space different from space in life in art?Many contemporary artists deal with space by concentrating on real space— the dimensions of a house, the spaces that we travel through in the city or in the natural world, the boundless spaces of the sky or the virtual space of the Internet. We work with fine-art or industrial materials— from wood and stone to steel and plastic— to frame space or to create space-filling work. Materials such as electrical lighting, film, video, or digital media can also transform, document, or create space. Viewers may be surrounded by art, or they can contribute to a concentrated experience or a perception of a real space. When an artist creates a piece of work for a room or a specific space, it is called installation art. Most installations are temporary and often require multiple senses, such as sight, sound and smell.​</h2><br />

Two-thirds of these parents say that parenting today is harder than it was 20 years ago for most parents.

Older parents are more likely to say that raising children has grown more difficult, with 71% of parents 50 and older saying parenting is harder, compared with smaller shares of parents ages 18 to 49 (65%).</p><p></p><p>The survey also asked parents to explain, in their own words, why they believe parenting is easier or harder today for most parents than it was 20 years ago.</p><p></p><p>Among respondents who believe that parenting is harder today, 26% cite technology. Many of these responses mention the increased use of technology and the rapid changes in technology that can be hard for parents to keep up with.

This study examined the relationship of book and e-book, this paper tends to identify in 1 affects reading comprehension. Three out of ten students in the Philippines are more hooked to reading materials published online. This paper's objectives aim to find the centre problem of the respondents when it comes to understanding complex material. 2. The physical "brick and mortar" classroom is starting to lose its monopoly as the place of learning. The Internet has made online learning possible, and many researchers and educators are interested in online learning to enhance and improve student learning outcomes while combating the reduction in resources, particularly in higher education. It is only three percent of the population worldwide compared to traditional face-to-face format and the factors that influence the effectiveness of online courses. This study examines the evidence of the effectiveness of online learning by organizing and summarizing the findings and challenges of online learning into positive, negative, mixed, and null findings. 3. The purpose of this study was comparing effectiveness of methods of presentation of concept maps and methods of concept mapping on reading comprehension. The subjects of this study consisted of sixty-six third-year high school students (thirty-three female, thirty-three male), that were selected randomly by multistage sampling method. Participants were randomly assigned to three treatment groups and 1 control group. The research instruments were: 1) experimental texts, 2) comprehension test, and 3) Camp Tools software, and 4) Teacher-generated concept maps. Treatment groups included computer-based concept mapping, paper-pencils concept mapping, and reading text with prepared concept maps. The control group for the study did not receive any concept map. The results of this study indicated that presentation of per-prepared concept maps significantly improved comprehension, compared to the map generation and control group. But paper- pencil and computer-based concept mapping compared to the control groups were not statistically significant.
