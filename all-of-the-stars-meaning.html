Many of these constellations have names that can be traced back to early Babylonians and Greek civilizations, but nearly all cultures have different names for the constellations. For example, the Greeks called the large constellation Orion, which means hunter and is prominent in the night sky all over the world during winter. Early Filipinos visualized the same group of stars as Balatik, a trap used in hunting wild pigs. Christian Filipinos named the three stars (Orion’s belt) Tatlong Maria or Tres Marias. Procedure: ▪ Given a plain map of stars, draw any pattern, name it, and tell a story about your figure. Write your bases for coming up with your figure.​</a>

 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>To create my pattern in the sky, I decided to focus on the constellation Cassiopeia, which is visible in the northern hemisphere during autumn and winter. Cassiopeia is easily recognizable as a "W" shape in the sky, and it is named after a queen from Greek mythology who was punished for her vanity.</p><p></p><p>Using my markers, I drew the "W" shape of Cassiopeia on my map of stars, and then I added some additional stars around it to create a larger figure. I named this pattern "Cassiopeia's Throne," and I imagined it as a majestic seat made of stars that the queen herself might have sat upon.</p><p></p><p>As for my bases for coming up with this figure, I was inspired by the shape of Cassiopeia itself and its association with royalty. I wanted to create a larger pattern that would reflect this sense of grandeur and power, so I added some extra stars to make it look more like a throne. Finally, I decided to name it after Cassiopeia to tie it back to the original constellation and its mythology.</p><p></p><p>In my story about Cassiopeia's Throne, I imagined that the queen herself had created this pattern in the sky as a way to symbolize her power and authority. Whenever her subjects looked up at the night sky and saw her throne shining brightly, they would be reminded of her strength and leadership. Over time, the pattern became associated with Cassiopeia's legacy, and it continued to shine in the sky for generations to come.</p><br />

The bright star Polaris, also known as the North Star, has been used for navigation by sailors and travelers for centuries, as its position in the sky relative to the Earth's axis remains relatively constant. Although many cultures have different names and interpretations of constellations, the study of these celestial objects has been a universal human interest throughout history.</p><br />

                            19. Which three pieces of evidence support the idea that the people do not know what the star is?
 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</h2><br />

<p>
</p><p>
</p><strong>It means that the one who is well regarded and does it in the right way, and  who is down to earth, has been given ample praise by his people and other high-ranking personnel.
</strong><p>
</p>To control the people by laws, to maintain order among them by chastisement, and to flee from you, and to lose all self-respect. For my view, moral strength is pleasant. Those who rule by  wisdom and kindness will be respected and cared for by those who aid, direct and support, therefore those who aid with their hearts will be answered by kindness by the people whom they help.

                            30. markers Procedure: Given a plain map of stars, draw any pattern, name it, and tell a story about your figure. Write your bases for coming up with your figure. Figure 6.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>I drew a pattern that resembles a dragon, and I named it "The Dragon of the Sky." To come up with this figure, I connected some of the brightest stars in the map using imaginary lines and added some curved lines to create the shape of a dragon. The head of the dragon is formed by three stars that are aligned horizontally, while its body is made up of a series of stars that curve and loop around.</p><p></p><p>According to my story, the Dragon of the Sky is a legendary creature that guards the heavens. It is said that the dragon was once a fierce warrior who was so brave that the gods decided to elevate it to the skies as a constellation. The dragon's mission is to protect the stars and ensure that they remain in their rightful place. The Dragon of the Sky is also said to bring good luck to those who spot it in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>Overall, I came up with this figure by looking for stars that were in close proximity to each other and connecting them to create a shape that resembled a dragon. I chose the dragon because it is a common mythological creature that appears in many cultures around the world, and it adds a sense of mystery and intrigue to the night sky.</p><br />
