                                            Instructions: Read the example of an argumentative essay below.  
Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                                            Imagine that the manager of a designer clothing store believes that certain types of
people are more likely to visit their store and purchase their clothing than others.
To decipher which segment groups are most likely to be their customers, the
manager could design a survey for anyone who has been a visitor. This survey
could include closed-ended questions on gender, age, employment status, and any
other demographic information they'd like to know. Then, it would be followed by
questions on how often they visit the store and the amount of money they spend
annually. Since all the questions are closed-ended, the store manager could easily
quantify the responses and determine the profile of their typical customer. In this
case, the manager may learn that her most frequent customers are female
students, ages 18-25. This knowledge would allow her to move forward with an
action plan on how to cater to this niche better or break into other target
demographics. Make a sample questionnaire out of this situation. Use the rubrics
in What's New to assess your questionnaire.</a>

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable. The decaying process takes place with the help of bacteria and fungi, which are known as decomposers. Materials that do not decay are known as nonbiodegradable. These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

With the advancement in technology, try to discover by yourself what else youcan use to make everything better than today, then share it for the benefits of otherpeople.Word processors, though a common tool in the workplace can be quite cunning at timeespecially if you are typing a letter or making simple invitations. By doing so, theamount of time you utilize, particularly in Microsoft Word application is onlysuperficial. Imagine working in a company, you host an event like product launchingwhere you will invite 100 customers. The management of the company assigned you tolead the task. How are you going to accomplish this task using the knowledge, yougained in this module? What will be your plan to complete it so your immediate superiorwill recognize your effort?Furthermore, this module discussed another advanced feature of Microsoft Wordwhich is integration of images and other external materials. It tackled how images andother materials are placed within the document and how to manipulate them by usinga layout option specifically, text wrapping. Knowing these features can save you timefrom figuring out how and where to put the image. Now, since it was already discussedto you in this module, do you think that mail merge and image integration can becombined to complete a task, what would that task be? Can you think of reasons for acompany to lessen their expenditures of using it to communicate with customers?You can now take those questions above and share your thoughts using the spaceprovided below.​</a>

                                            Imagine that the manager of a designer clothing store believes that certain types of people are more likely to visit their store and purchase their clothing than others. To decipher which segment groups are most likely to be their customers, the manager could design a survey for anyone who has been a visitor. This survey could include closed-ended questions on gender, age, employment status, and any other demographic information they'd like to know. Then, it would be followed by questions on how often they visit the store and the amount of money they spend annually. Since all the questions are closed-ended, the store manager could easily quantify the responses and determine the profile of their typical customer. In this case, the manager may learn that her most frequent customers are female students, ages 18-25. This knowledge would allow her to move forward with an action plan on how to cater to this niche better or break into other target demographics.

Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2. Materials can be grouped into biodegradable and nonbiodegradable. Materials that rot and decay are known as biodegradable.

These materials can clog drainage and can cause water and land pollution._______3. One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower.

Students Who Study Abroad Achieve Greater Success
Much of our learning takes place outside the classroom. We learn how to maintain budgets forge  friendships, develop business relationships, and more. Imagine extending those skills on a global level.  We would immediately cease to believe the world only contains the people and things we can see but,  rather, a wide variety of opinions, customs, beliefs, and ethics. This is why every college-level student  must study abroad during their undergraduate years. They will learn more in that semester abroad than  in any other academic year.  
According to IES Abroad, a company that encourages students to become international leaders, students  who study abroad are more likely to be accepted into the graduate degree program of their choice. In  fact, 90% of students who studied abroad with IES are admitted to their first or second choice for graduate  school.  
Imagine walking into an interview and being able to discuss preparing the most popular dish in India or  organizing the best route to take from Sydney, Australia to Perth. Not only does this strike up a memorable  conversation, but it also demonstrates a student's fierce independence and determination. All this makes  someone who has studied abroad a more desirable candidate for their dream job. As if IES Abroad's  statistic above was not astounding enough, it has been proven that 97% of students who study abroad  find employment within 12 months of graduation (Smith, 2019, p. 17).Beyond college, students who study  abroad will be better equipped to succeed in the workplace. Their broadened worldview will help them  relate to their co-workers, especially in a worldwide organization. This increased scope of knowledge  allows 25% of students who study abroad to receive higher starting salaries. That is clear evidence that  their experiences and views are valued by employers.  
Despite all these benefits, some parents simply will not allow their children to study abroad. A portion will  argue that it is not safe. Others will argue that studying abroad costs too much money. In these cases, it  is important to look at one semester's financial aid statement. How much does it cost to be a student at  a local university? When tuition, housing, textbooks, transportation, and meal plans are considered, it  becomes difficult to argue that there is a stark difference in the cost of a semester at home versus a  semester abroad.  
Studying abroad will have long-lasting, positive implications on a student's future as an academic and a  professional. New windows of opportunity will be flung open the moment an undergraduate board a  plane. Why not make an appointment with the study abroad center at your university? You have nothing  to lose by starting a conversation today.

                            5. Imagine that the manager of a designer clothing store believes that certain types of
people are more likely to visit their store and purchase their clothing than others.
To decipher which segment groups are most likely to be their customers, the
manager could design a survey for anyone who has been a visitor. This survey
could include closed-ended questions on gender, age, employment status, and any
other demographic information they'd like to know. Then, it would be followed by
questions on how often they visit the store and the amount of money they spend
annually. Since all the questions are closed-ended, the store manager could easily
quantify the responses and determine the profile of their typical customer. In this
case, the manager may learn that her most frequent customers are female
students, ages 18-25. This knowledge would allow her to move forward with an
action plan on how to cater to this niche better or break into other target
demographics. Make a sample questionnaire out of this situation. Use the rubrics
in What's New to assess your questionnaire.</h2><br />

One afternoon, Emmanuel’s class adviser handed him a letter sealed in a small envelope and told him to give it to his parents. The boy went home and gave the envelope to his mother. His mother read the letter. Emmanuel was qualified for a full scholarship next school year in one of the prestigious schools in their town. His mother’s eyes welled up with tears of joy._________4. The Hertzsprung – Russel Diagram shows the three different types of stars. The first type is called the Main Sequence, which includes the sun. The stars are fueled by nuclear fusion, converting hydrogen into helium. The hotter they are, the brighter they become. They last for about five billion years. The second type includes the super giants. As they reach old age, they deplete their hydrogen supply. Their core contracts as their outer layers expand. Eventually, they will explode, becoming nebula or supernova, then white dwarfs, neutron stars, or black holes. The third type, smaller stars, consequently become white dwarfs, shrinking and depleting their nuclear fuels, finally becoming cold, dark, black dwarfs._________5. Pollination is the process by which pollen grains are transferred from one anther to the stigma of a flower. Pollination is classified self-pollination and cross-pollination. Self-pollination happens if the transfer of pollen grains occurs in the same flower. Cross-pollination occurs if the transfer is from the anther of one flower to the stigma of another flower of the same kind.II. A.

                            7. 3VALUINGAbraham Maslow said, "If the only tool you have is a hammer, every problem looks likea nail." With the advancement in technology, try to discover by yourself what else youcan use to make everything better than today, then share it for the benefits of otherpeople.Word processors, though a common tool in the workplace can be quite cunning at timeespecially if you are typing a letter or making simple invitations. By doing so, theamount of time you utilize, particularly in Microsoft Word application is onlysuperficial. Imagine working in a company, you host an event like product launchingwhere you will invite 100 customers. The management of the company assigned you tolead the task. How are you going to accomplish this task using the knowledge, yougained in this module? What will be your plan to complete it so your immediate superiorwill recognize your effort?Furthermore, this module discussed another advanced feature of Microsoft Wordwhich is integration of images and other external materials. It tackled how images andother materials are placed within the document and how to manipulate them by usinga layout option specifically, text wrapping. Knowing these features can save you timefrom figuring out how and where to put the image. Now, since it was already discussedto you in this module, do you think that mail merge and image integration can becombined to complete a task, what would that task be? Can you think of reasons for acompany to lessen their expenditures of using it to communicate with customers?You can now take those questions above and share your thoughts using the spaceprovided below.​</h2><br />

                            10. Imagine that the manager of a designer clothing store believes that certain types of people are more likely to visit their store and purchase their clothing than others. To decipher which segment groups are most likely to be their customers, the manager could design a survey for anyone who has been a visitor. This survey could include closed-ended questions on gender, age, employment status, and any other demographic information they'd like to know. Then, it would be followed by questions on how often they visit the store and the amount of money they spend annually. Since all the questions are closed-ended, the store manager could easily quantify the responses and determine the profile of their typical customer. In this case, the manager may learn that her most frequent customers are female students, ages 18-25. This knowledge would allow her to move forward with an action plan on how to cater to this niche better or break into other target demographics. Make a sample questionnaire out of this situation.​</h2><br />

The building up of gases in the Earth’s atmosphere causes the greenhouse effect. With so much gas in the atmosphere, the Earth becomes like a greenhouse because heat from the surface cannot easily escape into outer space. Global warming occurs because of the gases that block the heat from escaping to outer space. Hence, the temperature of the Earth rises. --------2.
