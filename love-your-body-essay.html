                                            Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

Lyubomirsky (2005) cited eight happiness ideas that we can do to be happy. Do kind things. This does not only bring happiness to the people you helped, but also to you. Remember good things in your life. Revisit a happy childhood memory or recall a time you made someone happy. Be grateful by saying “thank you” to the people who helped you. Being grateful helps us have a healthy heart! Spend time with your loved ones. We get happy chemicals when we bond with our family and friends. Forgive those people who hurt you. This helps you relieve the stress and burden your heart brings! Take time to exercise. Our body needs physical movement for a good blood flow. See the good things around you.

Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4. "Patchwork Girl" is a work of electronic literature by American Author, Shelley Jackson. I was written in Storyspace and published by Eastgate Systems in 1995, and tells the story through illustrations of parts of a female body that are stitched together through text and image.

                                            Activity 4 Write an opinion essay on this topic "climate change " Use opinion expressions to emphasize your point. In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</a>

                            6. Activity 4 Read to Write What to do: writing. Respect Begets Respect by Aruna Ladva, BK Publications London It's so easy to give respect to those who are worthy of it in your eyes, but how about giving respect to those who don't quite measure up! To give respect to all and not just those you like is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect says a lot more about us than it does about the one in front of us. Sometimes we believe we should only exercise this quality of respect towards those who have demonstrated that they are deserving of it. Yet, it is possible to have regard for all human beings, despite their actions in the moment. In fact, when we don't give regard to all, we deprive ourselves. How so? Because, in spiritual terms, to give is to receive. Therefore, waiting for others to become deserving, or withholding our respect until we feel they are worthy, deprives us of feeling and exercising this quality which is in reality a valuable treasure. Read thoroughly the essay below. Be sure to figure out the ideas of the author as reflected in her Respect, as a by-product of love, is one of our innate qualities. So, in truth, we should not really need to make effort to give it. Everybody is worthy of respect simply because they exist, because they are there in front of you. You may not approve of a person's behavior, but do not condemn the soul. They are soul beings and our brothers. It is when we don't realize that we are beings of love, that we go seeking love, approval, or regard from others. We only need something when we feel empty. When we are in our self-respect that automatically attracts respect from others and also helps them to engender respect for themselves. The opposite is true also. If we don't have something, then how can we give it? We need self-respect in order to be able to give respect to others. Only when we have self-respect, can we even begin to think of giving anything to others. When one has self-respect, then one need not compare or compete with another. That one can be assured that whatever is meant to come their way will do so, and in its right time. A person with self-respect understands that to compare is futile, and to compete is nonsensical. By contrast, comparing and competing are both symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum. Although some think they are the same, they are definitely not. Ego is always looking outward to what others are doing, wondering whether I am 'better than..., or 'worse than... and always. causes pain. Self-esteem is about building our sense of self from the inside, and cannot bring pain. Self-esteem is about self-love. When I really love myself, I will not cause harm to myself by becoming a traitor to my virtues. I will always take the side of virtue and face the enemy of the vices with insight and pure pride. In this way I will inevitably earn respect from others. If we have love and respect for ourselves and when we can see our own beauty, only then can we see the beauty and specialties of others. Then it will be very easy to give respect and create harmony. Always remember that each one of us came onto the earth to share a particular quality with the world. So if you can't see it, then look a little harder, for it will surely be there. It's Time... to stay in your self-respect and to exercise and multiply your quality of respect by giving it to another. In this way you will naturally earn respect from others. Remember respect begets respect. Directions: Write an essay citing the key ideas of the author.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p></p>Introduction:<p>In her essay "Respect Begets Respect", Aruna Ladva emphasizes the importance of giving respect to all individuals, regardless of their actions, because every person is worthy of respect simply because they exist.</p><p></p>Body:<p>The author argues that respect is an innate quality that we possess, and we should not have to make an effort to give it. However, it is crucial to have self-respect before giving respect to others. Self-respect helps us avoid comparing ourselves to others and to build our sense of self from the inside. The author also notes that when we love and respect ourselves, we can see the beauty and specialties of others, making it easier to give respect and create harmony.</p><p></p>Idea 1:<p>According to the author, respect is not only for those who deserve it but for everyone. To give respect to all individuals, even those who do not measure up to our standards, is the true meaning of giving respect. Not being able to show respect reflects more on us than the person in front of us. Waiting for others to become deserving or withholding respect until we feel they are worthy deprives us of exercising this quality, which is a valuable treasure.</p><p></p>Idea 2:<p>The author suggests that we are beings of love and that we should not seek love, approval, or regard from others because we already possess it within ourselves. Self-respect is the foundation for giving respect to others. A person with self-respect understands that comparing or competing with others is futile and nonsensical. Comparing and competing are symptoms of a fragile, inflated ego, and ego and esteem are at opposite ends of the spectrum.</p><p></p>Idea 3:<p>Lastly, the author believes that each one of us came onto this earth to share a particular quality with the world.

Self-respect is crucial because it forms the foundation for giving respect to others. Comparing and competing with others are futile and nonsensical, and they stem from a fragile, inflated ego. It is essential to look for the beauty and specialties in others to exercise and multiply our quality of respect, which will earn us respect from others naturally.</p><p></p><p></p><strong>#</strong><strong>CarryOnLearning</strong><strong>#</strong><strong>B</strong><strong>r</strong><strong>a</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>s</strong><strong>t</strong><br />

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

As stated in John 3:16 “For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son, that whosoever believes in him should not perish but have everlasting eternal life.” God love is so strong for his saints that he made sacrifices for us be a part of this world that he created. Christians should love the environment and its preservation and anyone who doesn’t the love of the father is not in him.

Tress may be cut down to build houses or to make a fire for heat. Everything that God created is resourceful and it’s for a purpose however, we should limit ourselves to what God provided in order to protect the environment. Most worldviews and religions have made the environment not a big enough issue and do not get involved. Not taking over the environment is a way of letting the enemy win and get what he came to destroy</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>kau na bahala magpili kung hanngang saan yung kaya nyong sagutan</p><br />

Why are schools still not ready to accept students?</p><p></p><p>The COVID-19 crisis has surprisingly changed the way people live and work.

Although the subtitle has been dropped from most modern editions, the allusive qualities of Frankenstein; or, the Modern Prometheus, is a horror novel by Mary Shelley, still remain. The reference here to the Titan Prometheus relies on centuries of interpretation through Greek myth and drama. Often seen as symbolizing the danger present when human knowledge oversteps its boundaries, Prometheus and what he represents are reflected in the product of Victor Frankenstein's ghastly experiments.2. Gregory Maguire's novel Wicked. The novel was inspired by L. Frank Baum's 1939 novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz. Inspired by the omitted story of how the Wicked Witch came to be wicked, Maguire created a story which defined the Wicked Witch's beginning 3. The Maenads Dionysus presided over fertility both for the vineyards and for women's wombs. His followers, predominantly female, were known as Maenads -meaning "raving ones". These women shared their god's love of wine and raucous behaviour, and he encouraged them to indulge in both. Marauding bands of Maenads terrorized the Theban countryside so much that Pentheus, the King of Thebes, banned the cult of Dionysus. The king's decree was angrily rejected by many women - including the king's own mother - who went out into the countryside to praise the wine-god in one last, climactic rite. Dionysus convinced Pentheus to climb a tree to enjoy the view of the final orgy. Dressed in women's clothes, the king went to watch, but was seen by the ecstatic Maenads. Mistaking him for a wild animal, they tore him limb from limb. See also: The Olympian gods. The many affairs of Zeus. Vesta and Priapus A complex god 4.

                            21. Activity 4 Write an opinion essay on this topic "climate change " Use opinion expressions to emphasize your point. In writing your essay, you may use the following structure. Paragraph 1 - Write an introduction to your essay. State your main idea or the point you are trying to prove and give two reasons for your stand. Example: In my opinion, Covid-19 forced us to take a break from our normal activities and continue living in the comfort of our own homes. Because of this pandemic, many kinds of hero stepped forward to save lives and protect the vulnerable. On the other hand, a lot of workers lost their jobs while some decided to commit crimes to answer the call of a rumbling stomach. Paragraph 2 and 3 Write the body of your essay. Explain in detail the reasons you have stated in your first paragraph. Develop a paragraph for each reason you have cited. Example: Front liners took their oath seriously to save lives no matter what is at stake. They left behind their worrying families to combat an invisible enemy. Good Samaritans readily offered their resources to feed both the front liners and the hungry. Good Samaritans offered a portion of their wealth to help put a stop to this viral outbreak. The more people were encouraged to apply social distancing, the more they got closer to their loved ones. On the contrary, we have witnessed how some took advantage of the situation to satisfy their personal interests. We have seen how oppression happened just because the victims were helpless. We had a glimpse of the wolves hiding behind sheep's clothing. ragraph 4-Write your conclusion. Sum up your position by restating your in idea and finishing with a "call to action."​</h2><br />

Through believing on what our country can do, to support, recognize and be proud of our ethnicity and culture that represents our country, Philippines. I was born and raised in the Philippines and throughout the years, I have seen the changes in the attitudes, practices, culture, and beliefs of the Filipinos.

                        <p><strong>Three Things you need to remember during debate</strong></p><p>Debate competition may be tricky for some reasons. Sometimes we feel certain motions can be undebatable since we are not in the favour side of the house and it makes us less engage to the debate. Somehow, the debaters need to be actively engaged during the debate so the adjudicator can credit them more. These three things will help you win the debate even when you are not really knowing how the motion supposedly works.</p><p>During the debate, first, make sure that you and your team fulfill the speakers’ role. In Asian Parliamentary debate, there are 3 speakers which have various crucial responsibilities which need to be fulfilled. As the first speaker, we really need to settle the definition of the motion by contextualizing the real problem of the motion. Defining motion based on a dictionary won’t help the adjudicator know what your team’s stance on the debate is. As a second speaker, giving rebuttal will help the team a lot because it means your team can engage actively in the debate. Third speaker will need more cases or examples of the case to extend the whole team argument. Second of all, giving responses through POI (Point of Information) actively will make the adjudicator think that your team can contribute actively to the debate. Last but not least, construct your argument based on AREL (Assertion, Reasoning, Evidence, Linkback) structure. By having a clear segment on the argument, it makes it easier in delivering the argument, on the other hand it will help the adjudicator to write down your argument easily.</p><p>Fulfilling the speaker's role, actively engaging the debate through POI, and constructing arguments with AREL structure are basic things for debaters which shouldn’t be ignored in every debate round. Winning or losing may happen in a competition, but if you remember these three things during debate it will help increase the winning probability. </p><p></p><p><strong>Further Explanation:<br /></strong>A. First Paragraph must be the <strong>introduction</strong> paragraph. We can start it by write the background or the basic problem of things that we want to write in the essay which usually called as a hook. Hook can be something compelling such as a question, a powerful quote, or an interesting fact. After that, we need to put the thesis statements which usually located at the end of the first paragraph. <br /><br /><strong>Hook:</strong> Debate competition may be tricky for some reasons.</p><p><strong>Background Points:</strong></p><p>- In what way we can say that debate is tricky<br />- What is the harm</p><p><strong>Thesis Statement:</strong> These three things will help you win the debate even when you are not really knowing how the motion supposedly works.</p><p><br />B. Second paragraph is the <strong>body</strong>. Create a topic sentence for this body paragraph that communicates this and also transitions from the introduction into the body. Since the thesis statements mentioning about three things, we need to make sure every single things marked by word or phrases like first, second, finally, last but not least, etc. It makes the reader easier in identifying the point of the essay. Make sure each point has their own supporting sentences.<br /><br />C. As with most <strong>conclusion</strong> paragraphs, this paragraph ought to restate the thesis in different words.<br /><br /><strong>Learn more about short essay</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/26062292</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/65542</p><p><strong> <br />#SPJ1</strong></p><p></p><br />
