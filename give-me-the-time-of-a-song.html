                                            The chosen song is "Scars To Your Beautiful" by Alessia Cara
Explanation:
Title: Who I am
The song Scars to Your Beautiful by Alessia Cara is all about self-acceptance. It gives you the motivation that you do not need to undergo several surgeries and physical changes to be accepted by society. This is one of the songs in my gallery that I can relate to. It is not based on love stories like most of the emerging pop songs and rap anthems.
One of the lines that greatly hit me is "She craves, attention she praises, an image , She prays to be". I admit that sometimes I tend to get insecure with myself. Sometimes, I get jealous of individuals who are so physically attractive. I tend to be insecure and want to be more than who I am today. I want to achieve glowing skin, healthy and pearly white teeth, a clear face, and attractive eyelashes.
Even if this song will be out of the most popular songs in the market, it will still be one of my favorites because it helped me understand how to appreciate myself for who I really am. I know I am not the only one who can relate to this because in our present time, most people will see what is on the outside more than what is on the inside.</a>

                        <p></p><p>       While reading the poem Africa's plea, I discovered the value of love and respect for humanity. The poem discussed how it feels when someone humiliate you as you are and being judged by them. Those stanzas suggested that no one can create another person who is exactly like him, and that we must all recognize this and learn to value others. It also helps us realize that you are unique on your own way and that we must all recognize this and learn to value others. So there's no need for us to compare ourselves to one another or compel others to behave, communicate, or think the way we do. What matters is that we understand how to treat others as we respect ourselves.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                            18. The chosen song is "Scars To Your Beautiful" by Alessia Cara
Explanation:
Title: Who I am
The song Scars to Your Beautiful by Alessia Cara is all about self-acceptance. It gives you the motivation that you do not need to undergo several surgeries and physical changes to be accepted by society. This is one of the songs in my gallery that I can relate to. It is not based on love stories like most of the emerging pop songs and rap anthems.
One of the lines that greatly hit me is "She craves, attention she praises, an image , She prays to be". I admit that sometimes I tend to get insecure with myself. Sometimes, I get jealous of individuals who are so physically attractive. I tend to be insecure and want to be more than who I am today. I want to achieve glowing skin, healthy and pearly white teeth, a clear face, and attractive eyelashes.
Even if this song will be out of the most popular songs in the market, it will still be one of my favorites because it helped me understand how to appreciate myself for who I really am. I know I am not the only one who can relate to this because in our present time, most people will see what is on the outside more than what is on the inside.</h2><br />
