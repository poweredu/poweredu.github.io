                                            *The Tale of the White Squash*There once lived a couple who had a squash plant that gave them food to eat every day. Despite being childless both were happy for they liked nothing so much as boiled squash for dinner.One day they discovered that they had eaten their last squash. They waited patiently but no new fruit came. Oh God? They prayed, if you please give us some more squash fruit. Not long after, a white squash appeared. They were astonished for it was the first white squash they had ever seen. The couple could hardly wait for the fruit to ripen as soon as it was big enough, the husband said: “wife, pick the fruit and before she opened it, she heard a voice from it. “Please don’t hurt me” said the voice.“Husband” cried the woman “come here” this squash can talk. Don’t be afool, replied her husband. At your age you ought to know that no squash can talk. “But please do not hurt me”, said the voice. Upon hearing the man,himself took the knife and carefully cut the fruit open. And a beautiful baby stood up and smiled.“Thank you for letting let me out.”After recovering from their surprised the wife proceeded to fetch water from the well. She spread a mat on the floor and laid the baby on it. She started to bathe in the baby but to her surprise, the water splashed on the baby’s body rolled down to the mat as shining piece of gold. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever. The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.Analysis and Discussion:1. Who were the main characters in the story?2. What did they see after cutting the squash carefully?3. What happens every time the wife bathes the baby?4. Did the couple appreciate the opportunity given to them?5. Explain “Money is the root of all evil”. Is this saying true in the story?​</a>

Identify the possible phenotypes, genotypes and the percent ratios. Activity Proper: 1. In plants known as “our o'clocks", the allele for the dominant red-flower is incompletely dominant over the allele for white flowers. A gardener allows several heterozygous pink-flowered four o'clocks to pollinate and collects 350 seeds. 2. Skin color in humans is determined by a polygenic inheritance system, possibly involving as many as 9 genes.

                            5. *The Tale of the White Squash*There once lived a couple who had a squash plant that gave them food to eat every day. Despite being childless both were happy for they liked nothing so much as boiled squash for dinner.One day they discovered that they had eaten their last squash. They waited patiently but no new fruit came. Oh God? They prayed, if you please give us some more squash fruit. Not long after, a white squash appeared. They were astonished for it was the first white squash they had ever seen. The couple could hardly wait for the fruit to ripen as soon as it was big enough, the husband said: “wife, pick the fruit and before she opened it, she heard a voice from it. “Please don’t hurt me” said the voice.“Husband” cried the woman “come here” this squash can talk. Don’t be afool, replied her husband. At your age you ought to know that no squash can talk. “But please do not hurt me”, said the voice. Upon hearing the man,himself took the knife and carefully cut the fruit open. And a beautiful baby stood up and smiled.“Thank you for letting let me out.”After recovering from their surprised the wife proceeded to fetch water from the well. She spread a mat on the floor and laid the baby on it. She started to bathe in the baby but to her surprise, the water splashed on the baby’s body rolled down to the mat as shining piece of gold. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever. The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.Analysis and Discussion:1. Who were the main characters in the story?2. What did they see after cutting the squash carefully?3. What happens every time the wife bathes the baby?4. Did the couple appreciate the opportunity given to them?5. Explain “Money is the root of all evil”. Is this saying true in the story?​</h2><br />
