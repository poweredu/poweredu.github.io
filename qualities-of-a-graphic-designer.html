                                            The association of mathematics teachers had organized a seminar for secondary mathematics teachers in your region. The theme of the seminar is on conic sections and their application to real life. Inclusive of the registration fee are meals and snacks, program, training kits a T-shirt.The association desires to come up with a common computer-generated graphics design for the front cover of the program, tarpaulin for the stage and the T-shirts. The details of the design feature the equations and graphs of conic sections and their practical application to life situations. 	You are one of the famous designers/ graphic artists in your province. Knowing your expertise in Mathematics, you were contracted by the association to create a design for each of the three mentioned aspects of the seminar. The following are the additional instructions given: 	a. The design should contain any of the characteristics (graphs, equations, properties) of any of the four conic sections- circle, parabola, ellipse and hyperbola. b. There should be at most five colors used in the design. c. For the T-shirt, the design should include the title of the seminar, theme, date, and venue. You are free to position the text with respect to the design that you have created. d. The front cover of the program and the tarpaulin should indicate the title of the seminar, theme, date, and venue, and the name of the association. e. The design should be relevant to the theme of the seminar. 	 	The design will be evaluated based on its relevance to the theme, originality, creativity and overall visual quality/ impact​</a>
