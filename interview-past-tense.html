With just a glimpse of her eyes outside the window, she saw mountains of huge rocks falling from the distant hills.After what she saw, she hurriedly alarmed her parents and siblings. Together they run as fast as they could without even thinking of their things inside the house. As they were several meters away from their house, a big slashing rock from the mountain top exactly hit their home. </p><p></p><p>        After what had happened, and inspite of the fact that they have lost everything, they were still very thankful to God for not letting anything happen to anyone of them.
