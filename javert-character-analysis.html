                                            Answer the following questions in relation to the movie, Les Miserables: 1. Inspector Javert sincerely believes he is doing God's will by enforcing justice. However, he unwittingly is deeply inhospitable with no room for grace and compassion. Those of us who are committed to Christianity can also often come across as unwelcoming and harsh. Why do you think this is the case? Is there anything we can do to change this? 2. An integral part of welcoming others is knowing when to also let them go. Valjean faces this with Cosette. What do you think gives him the grace to do so? And what challenges does he have in letting go?​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><strong> Because he was jealous of him. He knew that he was the better person of the two, and he knew that Valjean's imprisonment was unjustified.</strong><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Hope this helpsPa brainliest poHave a nice day<p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Characters Javert</p><p>Javert is so obsessed with enforcing society’s</p><p> laws and morals that he does not realize he is</p><p> living by mistaken assumptions—a tragic and</p><p> ironic flaw in a man who believes so strongly</p><p> in enforcing what he believes is right. Although</p><p> Javert is such a stern and inflexible character</p><p> that it is hard to sympathize with him, he</p><p> lives with the shame of knowing that his own</p><p> Gypsy upbringing is not so different from the</p><p> backgrounds of the men he pursues. He lives his life trying to erase this shame through his strict commitment to upholding the law.</p><p></p><p>Javert’s flaw, however, is that he never stops to question whether the laws themselves are just. In his mind, a man is guilty when the law declares him so. When Valjean finally gives Javert irrefutable proof that a man is not necessarily evil just because the law says he is, Javert is incapable of reconciling this new knowledge with his beliefs. He commits suicide, plagued by the thought that he may be living a dishonorable life. True to Javert’s nature, he makes this decision not with any emotional hysterics, but rather with a cool determination. Although he is a man of logic, he is impassioned about his work. To this end, Hugo frequently uses animal imagery to describe Javert, particularly when he likens him to a tiger. In the end, it is difficult to feel anything other than pity for Javert, who assumes his duty with such savagery that he seems more animal than man.</p><br />

                            10. Answer the following questions in relation to the movie, Les Miserables: 1. Inspector Javert sincerely believes he is doing God's will by enforcing justice. However, he unwittingly is deeply inhospitable with no room for grace and compassion. Those of us who are committed to Christianity can also often come across as unwelcoming and harsh. Why do you think this is the case? Is there anything we can do to change this? 2. An integral part of welcoming others is knowing when to also let them go. Valjean faces this with Cosette. What do you think gives him the grace to do so? And what challenges does he have in letting go?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. In Les Miserables, Inspector Javert represents a rigid adherence to the law without room for mercy or forgiveness. This kind of thinking can be prevalent among some religious people who may see the world in black and white terms, with little room for nuance or compassion. This mindset can stem from a fear of deviating from what is perceived as "right" and a desire for control. However, this can lead to a lack of empathy and understanding for others, which can come across as unwelcoming and harsh.</p><p></p><p>To change this, those committed to Christianity can work towards cultivating empathy and compassion for others, recognizing that everyone has their own struggles and challenges. This can involve actively seeking out and learning from diverse perspectives, practicing empathy and active listening, and prioritizing kindness and understanding in interactions with others. Additionally, a focus on forgiveness and grace, as exemplified by Valjean's journey in the film, can help shift the focus from strict adherence to rules towards a more compassionate and forgiving approach.</p><p></p><p>2. Valjean's decision to let go of Cosette is rooted in his deep love for her and desire for her happiness. He recognizes that his presence in her life may ultimately bring her harm, and so makes the difficult decision to allow her to move on without him. Valjean's ability to let go is a testament to his growth and selflessness throughout the film, as he learns to prioritize the needs and happiness of others over his own desires.</p><p></p><p>However, letting go is not without its challenges. Valjean must confront his own feelings of loss and loneliness, and grapple with the idea that he may not be able to protect those he loves. Additionally, letting go requires a certain level of trust in the world and in others, which can be difficult for individuals who have experienced trauma or loss. Ultimately, Valjean's ability to let go is a reflection of his strength and resilience, as well as his commitment to doing what is best for those he cares about.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>This approach regards literature to be examined on its own terms." as s "a unique form of human knowledge that needs</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>2</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>A historical approach relies heavily on the author and his world. In the historical view, it is important to understand the author and his world in order to understand his intent and to make sense of his work.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Feminist criticism is concerned with "the ways in which literature (and other cultural productions) reinforce or undermine the economic, political, social, and psychological oppression of women" (Tyson 83).</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>4</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>A tendency—rather than a recognized school—within literary criticism to judge literary works according to moral rather than formal principles. Moral criticism is not necessarily censorious or 'moralizing' in its approach, although it can be; nor does it necessarily imply a Christian perspective, although it often does.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>5</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>In literary theory, a Marxist interpretation reads the text as an expression of contemporary class struggle. Literature is not simply a matter of personal expression or taste. It somehow relates to the social and political conditions of the time.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>6</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Reader-response theory could be categorized into several modes including: 1) “Transactional” approach used by Louise Rosenblatt and Wolfgang Iser 2) “Historical context” favored by Hans Robert Juass 3) “Affective stylistics” presented by Stanley Fish 4) “Psychological” approach employed by Norman Holland 5) “</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>7</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Reader-response criticism attempts to describe what happens in the reader's mind while interpreting a text. If traditional criticism assumes that imaginative writing is a creative act, reader-response theory recognizes that reading is also a creative process.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>8</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Biographical criticism is a form of literary criticism which analyzes a writer's biography to show the relationship between the author's life and their works of literature</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>9</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>Feminist criticism concerns with the woman's role in society as portrayed through texts. It typically analyzes the plight of woman as depicted in the story. Generally, it criticizes the notion of woman as a construct through literature.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>10</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Conflict theory, first developed by Karl Marx, is a theory that society is in a state of perpetual conflict because of competition for limited resources. Conflict theory holds that social order is maintained by domination and power, rather than by consensus and conformity.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>11</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Les Misérables is a show about courage, love, heartbreak, passion, and the resilience of the human spirit—themes which undoubtedly transcend time and place. Perhaps the most relevant themes, however, are related to the dignity of the human person.</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>12.</strong><strong>Javert is a fictional character and the main antagonist of Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Misérables. He was presumably born in 1780 and died on June 7, 1832. First a prison guard, and then a police inspector, his character is defined by his legalist tendencies and lack of empathy for criminals of all forms.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>13</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Cosette is a fictional character in the 1862 novel Les Misérables by Victor Hugo and in the many adaptations of the story for stage, film, and television. Her birth name, Euphrasie, is only mentioned briefly. As the orphaned child of an unmarried mother deserted by her father, Hugo never gives her a surname.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>14</strong><strong>.</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Fantine is a fictional character in Victor Hugo's 1862 novel Les Misérables. She is a young grisette in Paris who becomes pregnant by a rich student.
