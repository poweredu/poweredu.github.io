                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bird Box</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Bird Box is a horror movie that is very scary and terrifying. Unlike the other horror movies, everything is dark especially their main character (Like The Nun).</p><p>Bird Box is actually terrifying because of the scenes that were cast in the movie. The main characters are Felix, Olympia, Whistling Marauder. The ending at the story was, they are in a safe place where the "monster" can't kill them. This is how it works. Whenever you see around your place, you will feel something strange, it means, you got catched by the monster and you will automatically die. Bird Box is my favourite movie because it was my first ever movie I watched that was very unique, the idea of the movie was very good and unique. The scenes they cast was very hardworking so I love it.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The theme of the movie "No Escape" is survival in a foreign country amidst a violent coup. The film explores the challenges faced by an American family, who must navigate the chaos and violence to escape the country alive. What surprised me was the intensity and brutality of the violence depicted in the movie. The filmmakers were trying to tell us that we should always be prepared for the unexpected, and that our ability to survive in dangerous situations depends on our willingness to adapt and think creatively.</p><p></p><p>2.From this movie, I learned the importance of being resourceful and resilient in the face of adversity. I was surprised by how the family managed to find ways to stay alive despite the odds being stacked against them.</p><p></p><p>3.There was nothing that I didn't understand in the movie.

He took this action because he knew that it was his only chance to get his family out of the country alive. His motivation was to protect his family and ensure their survival. He was willing to risk his own life to save his loved ones.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. There are five of them: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Anger and Disgust. Each emotion is depicted in the film as its own separate character: Joy is a glowing, sparkly fairy-like cheerleader oozing positivity and optimism. The short, frumpy-looking Sadness is your typical Debbie Downer: mopey, teary and lethargic.</p><p>2. Inside Out reminds us to embrace the wholeness of ourselves, give ourselves permission to not be “okay,” and that we have to give those around us a chance to work through their emotional realizations. It's not about trying to avoid uncomfortable feelings but rather go towards them to get honest with ourselves and grow.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hi to me and my family and friends of the year and a half years of the year and a half years of service in a few months</p><br />

Beethoven allowed the young boy to appreciate music even without direct contact. Even if the young boy saw him as a weird person in the beginning, he was able to gain the interest of the young boy.

Beethoven also displayed courage even through the tragedy of being deaf. He felt the music within without the help of his hearing.

                        Jean ValJean. He is my favourite as from being a convict, with his encounter with kindness from a bishop, his life eventually change and he became a better person who's willing to help out. Also one of my favourite characters is Fantine, who sacrificed a lot to do the best for her child Cosette.<br /><br />

                            30. Who is your favorite character in the movie the immortal beloved?why?</h2><br />
                        <p>I consider the character of Ludwig van Beethoven, who is
played by the actor Gary Oldman, as my favorite character in the 1994 movie,
Immortal Beloved, because of his innate mysteriousness, which transcended even
until his death. </p>

<p> </p>

<p>Historically, Beethoven was a famous German composer and
artist who died on 26 March 1827 in Vienna, Austria.</p>
