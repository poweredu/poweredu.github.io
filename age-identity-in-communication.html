                                            Study the given passage below. VIGNETTE 2.6. Detailing the Methodologic al Choices and Personal Conditions in Doing a Qualitative Study Marwell’s (2007) study of community organizations in Brooklyn, New York, exemplifies how the various methodological choices and personal conditions can be thoroughly described. The study involved eight organizations, covering four organizational types in each of two neighborhoods. As a result, the author goes to considerable lengths to tell how she identified the candidates for these choices and how she made the final choices of both organizations and neighborhoods (pp. 239–248). Marwell’s participant-observation fieldwork took place over a 3-year period, and she describes her initial access to the field, the value of her working as a volunteer in these organizations, and her approach to keeping their identities anonymous or divulging them—the participants could decide for themselves after being shown the passages of text in which they appeared (2007, p. 253). Finally, the author gives much attention to the potential effects of her own personal (race, class, ethnic, linguistic, gender, and age) characteristics on her fieldwork experiences, discussing the possible influence of each characteristic separately (2007, pp. 255–259). Direction: Answer the following questions. Use 4 to 7 sentences only. 1. How could a researcher's demographic profile influence the research lens through which he or she sees events? Cite the demographic profiles being used in the passage. Answer:​</a>

                                            Study the given passage below. VIGNETTE 2.6. Detailing the Methodologic al Choices and Personal Conditions in Doing a Qualitative Study Marwell’s (2007) study of community organizations in Brooklyn, New York, exemplifies how the various methodological choices and personal conditions can be thoroughly described. The study involved eight organizations, covering four organizational types in each of two neighborhoods. As a result, the author goes to considerable lengths to tell how she identified the candidates for these choices and how she made the final choices of both organizations and neighborhoods (pp. 239–248). Marwell’s participant-observation fieldwork took place over a 3-year period, and she describes her initial access to the field, the value of her working as a volunteer in these organizations, and her approach to keeping their identities anonymous or divulging them—the participants could decide for themselves after being shown the passages of text in which they appeared (2007, p. 253). Finally, the author gives much attention to the potential effects of her own personal (race, class, ethnic, linguistic, gender, and age) characteristics on her fieldwork experiences, discussing the possible influence of each characteristic separately (2007, pp. 255–259). Direction: Answer the following questions. Use 4 to 7 sentences only. 1. How could a researcher's demographic profile influence the research lens through which he or she sees events? Cite the demographic profiles being used in the passage. Answer:​</a>

                            6. Study the given passage below. VIGNETTE 2.6. Detailing the Methodologic al Choices and Personal Conditions in Doing a Qualitative Study Marwell’s (2007) study of community organizations in Brooklyn, New York, exemplifies how the various methodological choices and personal conditions can be thoroughly described. The study involved eight organizations, covering four organizational types in each of two neighborhoods. As a result, the author goes to considerable lengths to tell how she identified the candidates for these choices and how she made the final choices of both organizations and neighborhoods (pp. 239–248). Marwell’s participant-observation fieldwork took place over a 3-year period, and she describes her initial access to the field, the value of her working as a volunteer in these organizations, and her approach to keeping their identities anonymous or divulging them—the participants could decide for themselves after being shown the passages of text in which they appeared (2007, p. 253). Finally, the author gives much attention to the potential effects of her own personal (race, class, ethnic, linguistic, gender, and age) characteristics on her fieldwork experiences, discussing the possible influence of each characteristic separately (2007, pp. 255–259). Direction: Answer the following questions. Use 4 to 7 sentences only. 1. How could a researcher's demographic profile influence the research lens through which he or she sees events? Cite the demographic profiles being used in the passage. Answer:​</h2><br />

                            16. Study the given passage below. VIGNETTE 2.6. Detailing the Methodologic al Choices and Personal Conditions in Doing a Qualitative Study Marwell’s (2007) study of community organizations in Brooklyn, New York, exemplifies how the various methodological choices and personal conditions can be thoroughly described. The study involved eight organizations, covering four organizational types in each of two neighborhoods. As a result, the author goes to considerable lengths to tell how she identified the candidates for these choices and how she made the final choices of both organizations and neighborhoods (pp. 239–248). Marwell’s participant-observation fieldwork took place over a 3-year period, and she describes her initial access to the field, the value of her working as a volunteer in these organizations, and her approach to keeping their identities anonymous or divulging them—the participants could decide for themselves after being shown the passages of text in which they appeared (2007, p. 253). Finally, the author gives much attention to the potential effects of her own personal (race, class, ethnic, linguistic, gender, and age) characteristics on her fieldwork experiences, discussing the possible influence of each characteristic separately (2007, pp. 255–259). Direction: Answer the following questions. Use 4 to 7 sentences only. 1. How could a researcher's demographic profile influence the research lens through which he or she sees events? Cite the demographic profiles being used in the passage. Answer:​</h2><br />
