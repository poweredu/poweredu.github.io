Where was it going? To the moon! The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Michail Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. They landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969. The moonwalk took place the following day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT, Commander Neil Armstrong emerged from the spacecraft and took his famous first step onto the moon's surface and declared, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." What a glorious moment in human history!Text 2Are you tired of seeing your paychecks slashed by unjust tax deductions? We work hard to provide for our families and then wind up only being able to live paycheck to paycheck. If you vote for me, I'll make sure your taxes are lowered and you get the government services that you depend on. Imagine everything you'll be able to do with more wiggle room in your monthly income. Cast your vote today.Text 3"We've become accustomed to a new way of being "alone together". Technology- enabled, we are able to be with one another, and also elsewhere, connected to wherever we want to be. We want to customize our lives. We want to move in and out of where we are because the thing we value most is control over where we focus our attention. We have gotten used to the idea of being in a tribe of one, loyal to our own party."​</a>

                        <p>Answer:</p><p>﻿1.efficiency</p><p>﻿Examples are plentiful: the drive-up window, salad bars, fill your own cup, self-serve gasoline, ATM's, Voice Mail, microwave dinners and supermarkets (versus the old-time groceries where you gave your order to the grocer)</p><p>﻿2.predictability</p><p>﻿"Predictability" means that no matter where a person goes, they will receive the same service and receive the same product every time when interacting with the McDonaldized organization. This also applies to the workers in those organizations. Their tasks are highly repetitive, highly routine, and predictable.</p><p>﻿3.Calculabiility</p><p>﻿objective should be quantifiable (e.g., sales) rather than subjective (e.g. taste). McDonaldization developed the notion that quantity equals quality, and that a large amount of product delivered to the customer in a short amount of time is the same as a high quality product.</p><p>﻿4.Control</p><p>﻿ - McDonaldization involves the search for the means to exert increasing control over both employees and customers. The employees have McDonald universities and handbooks to tell them exactly how to look and what to say. The customer is told what to do by having to pick up their own food at the register and clean up after themselves</p><p>﻿5.substiture or nonhuman technology</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                            18. Lesson1Informative, Persuasive and Argumentative Writing TechniquesObjectivesIn charting the course of your journey in this lesson, you are expected to: differentiate informative, persuasive and argumentative texts;use a variety of informative, persuasive and argumentative writingtechniques (EN10WC-IVb-14.1.2); and, write an informative, persuasive and argumentative text.PresentationTask 2: SEE THE DIFFERENCERead the following texts below. Take note of the writing techniques used and evaluate their similarities and differences in terms of style and structure.Text 1On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 spacecraft lifted off from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Where was it going? To the moon! The crew consisted of Neil Armstrong, Michail Collins, and Buzz Aldrin. They landed on the moon in the Sea of Tranquility on July 20, 1969. The moonwalk took place the following day. On July 21, 1969, at precisely 10:56 EDT, Commander Neil Armstrong emerged from the spacecraft and took his famous first step onto the moon's surface and declared, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind." What a glorious moment in human history!Text 2Are you tired of seeing your paychecks slashed by unjust tax deductions? We work hard to provide for our families and then wind up only being able to live paycheck to paycheck. If you vote for me, I'll make sure your taxes are lowered and you get the government services that you depend on. Imagine everything you'll be able to do with more wiggle room in your monthly income. Cast your vote today.Text 3"We've become accustomed to a new way of being "alone together". Technology- enabled, we are able to be with one another, and also elsewhere, connected to wherever we want to be. We want to customize our lives. We want to move in and out of where we are because the thing we value most is control over where we focus our attention. We have gotten used to the idea of being in a tribe of one, loyal to our own party."​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Text 1 is an informative text that aims to provide facts about the historic event of Apollo 11 and the first moon landing. The writing technique used is a straightforward presentation of information using a chronological order of events.</p><p></p><p>Text 2 is a persuasive text that aims to convince the reader to vote for the author by promising lower taxes and improved government services. The writing technique used is persuasive language, such as using emotional appeals and painting a picture of a better future if the reader votes for the author.</p><p></p><p>Text 3 is an argumentative text that aims to present an argument about how technology has changed the way people interact with each other. The writing technique used is a logical argument backed up with evidence, such as using rhetorical questions and providing examples.</p><p></p><p>In terms of style and structure, the three texts differ in their purpose and approach. Text 1 is straightforward and factual, while Text 2 and Text 3 use language and techniques to persuade or argue. Text 1 also follows a chronological order, while Text 2 and Text 3 use more flexible structures to achieve their goals.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>hope it help"</p><br />
