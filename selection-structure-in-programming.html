MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</a>

                                            Musical composition, music composition or simply composition, can refer to an original piece or work of music,[1] either vocal or instrumental, the structure of a musical piece or to the process of creating or writing a new piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers. Composers of primarily songs are usually called songwriters;[2][3] with songs, the person who writes lyrics for a song is the lyricist. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music "score," which is then performed by the composer or by other musicians. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all and instead compose the song in their mind and then play, sing or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.
Although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when all members of a band collaborate to write a song or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics and a third person orchestrates the songs.
A piece of music can also be composed with words, images or, since the 20th century, with computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from 20th century avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Karlheinz Stockhausen's Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman and Witold Lutosławski. A more commonly known example of chance-based, or indeterminate, music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces, and to include spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers.
In the 2000s, composition is considered to consist of the manipulation of each aspect of music (harmony, melody, form, rhythm and timbre), according to Jean-Benjamin de Laborde (1780, 2:12):
Composition consists in two things only. The first is the ordering and disposing of several sounds...in such a manner that their succession pleases the ear. This is what the Ancients called melody. The second is the rendering audible of two or more simultaneous sounds in such a manner that their combination is pleasant. This is what we call harmony and it alone merits the name of composition.

                                            "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".

MANILA, Philippines — “Undernutrition is the single greatest threat to a child’s life.”Dr Martin Parreño, National Program Officer of the World Food Programme-Philippines, called on Filipinos to pay more attention to child malnutrition at all times — with or without disasters.Latest statistics from the National Nutrition Council (NNC) showed that 67% of Filipino families are not eating enough even when there are no calamities.In the Philippines, malnutrition is seen across all age groups — from infancy to adulthood, the 2013 National Nutrition Survey revealed.“At the center of malnutrition’s underlying causes is inadequate childcare and feeding practices,” Parreño added. “And we don’t have a structure curriculum addressing this,” he said during the 2014 Dr Juan Salcedo Memorial Lecture organized by the Nutrition Foundation of the Philippines (NFP) on Thursday, October 9.Children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest in proper food and hygiene will most likely grow up to become the same kind of parents, hence perpetuating the cycle.The Department of Education has been working on integrating health and nutrition lessons in school curricula. More recent strategies also try to involve parents in classes and school-based supplementary feeding programs.Such efforts, however, will remain fruitless unless more parents realize the value of nutrition and their roles as primary caregivers.​comprehension questions:1. what is the main issue presented?2. as cited, what is the underlying cause of this problem?3.how can we solve malnutrition problem in the Philippines?4. do you agree that children who grew up in homes where parents did not care or invest proper food and hygiene will mostly become the same kind of parents in the future? why or why not?5. what can you say on the DepEd's plan to integrate health and nutrition lesson in school curricula? do you think it is beneficial ?6. explain whenever you agree or disagree with the author's of opinion about malnutrition?​</h2><br />

                            23. Musical composition, music composition or simply composition, can refer to an original piece or work of music,[1] either vocal or instrumental, the structure of a musical piece or to the process of creating or writing a new piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers. Composers of primarily songs are usually called songwriters;[2][3] with songs, the person who writes lyrics for a song is the lyricist. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music "score," which is then performed by the composer or by other musicians. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all and instead compose the song in their mind and then play, sing or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music.
Although a musical composition often uses musical notation and has a single author, this is not always the case. A work of music can have multiple composers, which often occurs in popular music when all members of a band collaborate to write a song or in musical theatre, when one person writes the melodies, a second person writes the lyrics and a third person orchestrates the songs.
A piece of music can also be composed with words, images or, since the 20th century, with computer programs that explain or notate how the singer or musician should create musical sounds. Examples range from 20th century avant-garde music that uses graphic notation, to text compositions such as Karlheinz Stockhausen's Aus den sieben Tagen, to computer programs that select sounds for musical pieces. Music that makes heavy use of randomness and chance is called aleatoric music and is associated with contemporary composers active in the 20th century, such as John Cage, Morton Feldman and Witold Lutosławski. A more commonly known example of chance-based, or indeterminate, music is the sound of wind chimes jingling in a breeze. The study of composition has traditionally been dominated by examination of methods and practice of Western classical music, but the definition of composition is broad enough to include the creation of popular music and traditional music songs and instrumental pieces, and to include spontaneously improvised works like those of free jazz performers and African percussionists such as Ewe drummers.
In the 2000s, composition is considered to consist of the manipulation of each aspect of music (harmony, melody, form, rhythm and timbre), according to Jean-Benjamin de Laborde (1780, 2:12):
Composition consists in two things only. The first is the ordering and disposing of several sounds...in such a manner that their succession pleases the ear. This is what the Ancients called melody. The second is the rendering audible of two or more simultaneous sounds in such a manner that their combination is pleasant. This is what we call harmony and it alone merits the name of composition.

                            26. "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".
