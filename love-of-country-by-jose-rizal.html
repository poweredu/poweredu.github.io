                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Name: Jane Smith</p><p>Address: 123 Main St. Anytown, USA</p><p>Birthdate: June 15, 1985</p><p>Birthplace: Chicago, Illinois, USA</p><p>Highest Educational Attainment: Bachelor's Degree in Education</p><p>Principle in life: Treat others as you would like to be treated.</p><p></p><p>1. Jose Rizal is a true hero not only for Filipinos but for people all over the world. He used his talents and intelligence to fight for the rights and freedom of his countrymen. His sacrifice and bravery inspired many generations to stand up for what is right and just. For me, he embodies what a hero should be - selfless, intelligent, and compassionate.</p><p></p><p>2. Like Jose Rizal, I value education and the pursuit of knowledge. I believe that education is the key to unlocking opportunities and achieving one's dreams. I also share his love for literature, art, and music. He was a well-rounded individual who excelled in many fields, and I also strive for a balanced and fulfilling life.</p><p></p><p>3. One thing that I have differently from Jose Rizal is my nationality and cultural background. Although we share a common humanity, we have different experiences and perspectives shaped by our upbringing and environment. I also have not faced the same kind of oppression and injustice that he did as a Filipino living under Spanish colonial rule.</p><p></p><p>4. One vivid memory I have about love of country is when I participated in a rally for immigrant rights. There were people from different countries and cultures, but we all came together to demand equality and respect for all. It was inspiring to see people of different backgrounds unite for a common cause and fight for what they believe in.</p><p></p><p>5. In my opinion, nationalism or patriotism is best exhibited by serving others and the greater good. This can be done in many ways, such as volunteering in your community, standing up for the rights of marginalized groups, or contributing to the development of your country. It does not necessarily mean blindly following your government or country, but doing what is right and just for the benefit of all. Jose Rizal exhibited this kind of nationalism through his writings, advocacy, and sacrifice for his country.</p><br />

                            14. How did Jose P. Rizal show his love for the country?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Jose Rizal is said to have first expressed his sense of nation, and of the Philippines as a nation separate from Spain, as a young student in Manila. Proof of this, it is said, can be found in two of his writings.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation</strong><strong>:</strong></p><p></p><p>Jose Rizal is said to have first expressed his sense of nation, and of the Philippines as a nation separate from Spain, as a young student in Manila.  Proof of this, it is said, can be found in two of his writings.</p><p></p><p>In his poem “To the Philippine Youth”, which he wrote in 1879, when he was 18 years old (and which won a prize from the literary group), Rizal speaks of the Filipino youth as the “Fair hope of my Motherland”, and of the “Indian land” whose “son” is offered “a shining crown”, by the “Spaniard… with wise and merciful hand”</p><p></p><p>Still in this poem, Rizal considered Spain as a loving and concerned mother to her daughter Filipinas.</p><p></p><p>Rizal by this time had become a nationalist and had gone abroad for the cause of his countrymen.  This is confirmed by a line from a letter written to him by his friend Vicente Gella, in the same month he wrote “Love of Country”, (June 1882):</p>His essay “Love of Country” which he wrote in June 1882 (but appeared in the newspaper Diariong Tagalog Manila in August)3, when he was already in Spain, and he was 21 years old.  In it he talks of “love of country” which “is never effaced once it has penetrated the heart, because it carries with it a divine stamp..;” that it is “the most powerful force behind the most sublime actions” and for that reason, love of country “of all loves…is the greatest, the most heroic and the most disinterested”.4  He speaks of the Motherland for whom “some have sacrificed their youth, their pleasures…others their blood; all have died bequeathing to their Motherland…Liberty and glory.”5 <br /><br />It can be inferred from his words that at this point Rizal’s sense of nation was now fully-formed and complete, and perhaps not by happenstance, its expression coincides with his departure from his country.  While there is still no outright and open criticism of the friars, or the colonial government, or even of Spain for he may have only been being careful, Rizal by this time had become a nationalist and had gone abroad for the cause of his countrymen.  This is confirmed by a line from a letter written to him by his friend Vicente Gella, in the same month he wrote “Love of Country”, (June 1882):<br /><br /><br />“If the absence of a son from the bosom of his esteemed family is sad, no less will be that of a friend who, being very dear to all of us …his friends and comrades, now is away from us seeking the welfare that we all desire.  Had it not been for that, the separation would have been more painful for the distance that separates us.  May God help you for the good that you do to your fellow countrymen.”<br /><br /><br />Another letter written by his friend Jose M. Cecilio, dated August 28, 1882, also corroborates this:<br /><br /><br />“I’m very glad that you will go to Madrid where you can do many things in favor of this country jointly with the other Filipinos..so long as they will not give us freedom of the press, abuses, arbitrariness, and injustices will prevail more than in other parts of the world.”6<br /><br />      Ultimately, it does not matter when or even how Rizal’s politicization came, or why he went abroad: to complete his medical studies there; or, to expand his opportunities for establishing himself as a writer7; or to embark on a career as an activist-writer who would use his pen to secure long-needed reforms in the social and political fabric of his country.  And because the space for agitating for changes in the country was getting smaller by the day, it was time for him to leave.  Under his leadership, together with the other Filipino youth, the Reform- or Propaganda movement– as it became known, flourished and triumphed.  It triumphed not in the sense that it attained its main goals of obtaining parliamentary representation for the Filipinos, and freedom of the press, for these did not come to pass, but in the after- effects of its campaign, despite its apparent failure:  other youths followed in their footsteps and took the next step- to begin the campaign for separation and independence.   This was carried out by Bonifacio and the Katipunan, which launched the Revolution that, in turn, led to the birth of the Filipino nation.<br /><br />And so Rizal became a crusader for his country’s freedom.  He decided that love of country should supplant all other considerations, even that of his family or his own, or even of the woman he loved.  From his correspondence with friends and family, he remained constant to his Muse and his cause: the Motherland and her freedom.<br /><br />When he had completed his education, and his formation as a son deserving of the Motherland, Rizal felt it was time to return to her.  Friends and family stopped him from returning, but he was determined to do so, for he believed that the true arena for the fight was his country itself, not some foreign land.  In a letter dated October 1891, Rizal wrote,<br /><br />“If our countrymen are counting on us here in Europe, they are very much mistaken…The battlefield is the Philippines: There is where we should meet…there we will help one another, there together we will suffer or triumph perhaps.  The majority of our compatriots in Europe are afraid, they flee from the fire, and they are brave only so long as they are in a peaceful country!  The Philippines should not count on them; she should depend on her own strength.”8<br /><br />Rizal returned to the land of his birth knowing that its liberty cannot be “obtained…without pain or merit… nor is it granted gratis et amore.”9  He was prepared to return despite the risk of death, as he had written in June 1892 days before his arrival in Manila.<br /><br /><br /><br />

Filipinos don't realize that victory is the child of struggle, that joy blossoms from suffering and redemption are a product of sacrifice." - Jose Rizal </p><p>Filipinos forget easily especially when they content in the peace they are experiencing and they are complacent about it. The quality of being a Catholic is being forgiving, and Filipinos forgive in the wrong way. The right thing to do is to forgive but do not forget about the past. When you forego a bl0/0dy history, it tends to happen again until people are reminded of the horrors of it. </p><p>7. "What love can be purer and greater than love of country? What love? No other love, none."- Andres Bonifacio  </p><p>Anyone born in a nation should be expected to love it because it is their motherland. The love for one country is greater than anything because people are willing to d13 for it.  </p><p>8. “A nation will perish because not of evil men but of good men who just watch and did nothing."- Apolinario Mabini</p><p></p><p>It is often said that there is a special place in hell for people who are neutral. This is because watching bad things to happen idly does not save you from the catastrophic events.
