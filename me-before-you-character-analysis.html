THE MONKEY AND THE CROCODILE One stormy day, a monkey was standing by the shore of a river, wondering how he could get over by himself, for the water was deep, and he did not know how to swim. He looked about for some logs, but all he saw was a large crocodile with its mouth wide open, ready to seize him. He was very frightened, but he said, “Oh Mr. Crocodile! Please, do not kill me! Spare my life, and I will lead you to a place where you can get as many monkeys as will feed you all your life.” The crocodile agreed, and the monkey said that the place was on the other side of the river. So, the crocodile told him to get on his back, and he would carry him across. Just before they reached the bank, the monkey jumped to land, ran as fast as he could, and climbed up the tree where his mate was. The crocodile could not follow, of course, so he returned to the water saying, “The time will come when you shall pay.” END.21-22. Who are the characters in the story? 23-24.

                                            *The Tale of the White Squash*There once lived a couple who had a squash plant that gave them food to eat every day. Despite being childless both were happy for they liked nothing so much as boiled squash for dinner.One day they discovered that they had eaten their last squash. They waited patiently but no new fruit came. Oh God? They prayed, if you please give us some more squash fruit. Not long after, a white squash appeared. They were astonished for it was the first white squash they had ever seen. The couple could hardly wait for the fruit to ripen as soon as it was big enough, the husband said: “wife, pick the fruit and before she opened it, she heard a voice from it. “Please don’t hurt me” said the voice.“Husband” cried the woman “come here” this squash can talk. Don’t be afool, replied her husband. At your age you ought to know that no squash can talk. “But please do not hurt me”, said the voice. Upon hearing the man,himself took the knife and carefully cut the fruit open. And a beautiful baby stood up and smiled.“Thank you for letting let me out.”After recovering from their surprised the wife proceeded to fetch water from the well. She spread a mat on the floor and laid the baby on it. She started to bathe in the baby but to her surprise, the water splashed on the baby’s body rolled down to the mat as shining piece of gold. The couple had been so delighted to have the baby that it had seemed as if there was nothing more to wish for, but now that the gold had come to them also they were happier than ever. The next morning the woman gave the baby another bath, and again the water turned to gold. They now had enough money to build a large house. The third morning she brought water for his bath again, but he grew very sad and flew away. At the same time all the gold disappeared also, and the man and his wife were left poor and alone.Analysis and Discussion:1. Who were the main characters in the story?2. What did they see after cutting the squash carefully?3. What happens every time the wife bathes the baby?4. Did the couple appreciate the opportunity given to them?5. Explain “Money is the root of all evil”. Is this saying true in the story?​</a>

Then, familiarize the rubrics and WRITE YOUR SHORT ANALYSIS My Dream in DreamIn this dream I was the girl with tattered short pants and shirt. I enjoyed each beautiful day and it's a blessing. My eyes were open before the rays of the sun shone. I folded my favorite blanket made of flour sack and took a long deep breath to begin the day. As I slowly tiptoed down the bamboo ladder, I saw my nanay staring in the air. Slowly moving towards her and gently tapped her shoulder; she turned to me with tears dwelling in her eyes and said, "I can't afford to send you to school. Those words struck and stunned me. Looking at my nanay's worried face, I hugged her tightly and closed my eyes as tears started to drop. I felt relieved and motivated feeling my nanay's warm hug of comfort. Then, I told her, "Don't worry nay. I will help you in any way I can. I won't stop studying." Saying that promise, I went out of our dilapidated house with determination to surpass this financially drain situation. As I walked along the street, I could smell the fresh, buttery bread which makes my empty stomach grumble in hunger. I respectfully approached the bakery owner standing just outside the bakeshop as she managed the workers. "Ma'am, may I sell your pandesal in our barangay? You may give me commission based on the sold bread. I need to help my nanay since she doesn't have work." The owner stared at me with a stern look from head to toe. Then she said in a bossy tone, "All right. Be honest!" I happily carried the heavy blue ice bucket with 50 pieces of pan desal in it. The heaviness did not bother me for I counted the commission to receive once sold. I shouted loudly, "PANDESAL! PANDESAL! PANDESAL!" It was eight o'clock in the morning when my pan desal was sold. I decided to sit under the shade of the big mango tree. I carefully counted the money if it was in right amount to remit to the owner. While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream.charactersplot - foreshadowing and flashbackPOVmoodsymboltonethemefig. lang​​</a>

While I was counting, I heard group of boys talking, and I did not mind them. When suddenly SNAP! They snatched the money out of my hand and ran away. I was shocked and was not able to move. I felt my nerves were shaking and my blood was boiling. I only cried as my body was tired and my heart bleeds in anger. I felt the heavy tears in my eyes and realized it was all a dream.charactersplot - foreshadowing and flashbackPOVmoodsymboltonethemefig. lang​​</h2><br />
