                                            One night I had to look at a page from the Bible for three minutes and then report everything I could remember. "Now, Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and that's all I remember, Ma," I said, And after seeing my mother's disappointed face once again, something inside of me began to die. I hated the tests, the raised hopes, and failed expectations. Before going to bed that night, I looked in the mirror above the bathroom sink, and when I saw only my face staring back-and that it would always be this ordinary face-I began to cry. Such a sad, ugly girl! I made high-pitched noises like a crazed animal, trying to scratch out the face in the mirror. And then I saw what seemed to be the prodigy side of me because I had never seen that face before. I looked at my reflection, blinking so I could see more clearly. The girl staring back at me was angry, powerful. This girl and I were the same. I had new thoughts, willful thoughts, or rather thoughts filled with lots of won'ts. I won't let her change me, promised myself. I won't be what I'm not. -Excerpted from "Two kinds" in The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan Based on the passage, what do you think is a valid conclusion? A. The girl promises herself that she will make every effort to please her mother  B. The girl enjoys memorizing passages from the Bible.C. The girl changes from feeling sad to feeling powerful D. The girl decides to be true to herself.​</a>

                                            Elephant and Friends A lone elephant wandered the forest looking for friends. She came across a monkey and asked, “Will you be my friend, monkey?” “You are too big and cannot swing on trees as I do. So, I cannot be your friend”, said the monkey. The elephant them came across a rabbit and asked him if she could be his friend. “You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot be my friend”, replied the rabbit. Then the elephant met a frog and asked if she could be her friend. The frog said “You are too big and heavy. You cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you cannot be my friend”. The elephant asked a fox, and he got the same reply, that he was too big. The next day, all the animals in the forest were running in fear. The elephant stopped a bear and asked what was happening and was told that a tiger has been attacking all the animals. The elephant wanted to save the other weak animals and went to the tiger and said “Please sir, leave my friends alone. Do not eat them”. The tiger didn’t listen and asked the elephant to mind her own business. Seeing no other way to solve the problem, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared it away. She then went back to the others and told them what happened. On hearing how the elephant saved their lives, the animals agreed in unison, “You are just the right size to be our friend”. QUESTIONS: 1. Where was the elephant wandering? 2. Why was the elephant in the forest? 3. Who were the animals who came across him? 4, Why do these animals don’t want him to be a friend? 5. How did the elephant help the animals? If you were the elephant, would you do the same? Why or why not?​</a>

                                            EVALUATION DIRECTIONS: Read the selection below, then answer the questions that follow. Write your answers on the blanks provided. Elephant and Friends A lone elephant wandered the forest looking for friends. She came across a monkey and asked, "Will you be my friend, monkey?" "You are too big and cannot swing on trees as I do. So, I cannot be your friend", said the monkey. The elephant them came across a rabbit and asked him if she could be his friend. "You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot be my friend", replied the rabbit. Then the elephant met a frog and asked if she could be her friend. The frog said "You are too big and heavy. You cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you cannot be my friend". The elephant asked a fox, and he got the same reply, that he was too big. The next day, all the animals in the forest were running in fear. The elephant stopped a bear and asked what was happening and was told that a tiger has been attacking all the animals. The elephant wanted to save the other weak animals and went to the tiger and said "Please sir, leave my friends alone. Do not eat them". The tiger didn't listen and asked the elephant to mind her own business. Seeing no other way to solve the problem, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared it away. She then went back to the others and told them what happened. On hearing how the elephant saved their lives, the animals agreed in unison, "You are just the right size to be our friend". QUESTIONS: 1. Where was the elephant wandering? 2. Why was the elephant in the forest? 3. Who were the animals who came across him? 4, Why do these animals don't want him to be a friend? 5. How did the elephant help the animals? If you were the elephant, would you do the same? Why or why not?​</a>

                            4. One night I had to look at a page from the Bible for three minutes and then report everything I could remember. "Now, Jehoshaphat had riches and honor in abundance, and that's all I remember, Ma," I said, And after seeing my mother's disappointed face once again, something inside of me began to die. I hated the tests, the raised hopes, and failed expectations. Before going to bed that night, I looked in the mirror above the bathroom sink, and when I saw only my face staring back-and that it would always be this ordinary face-I began to cry. Such a sad, ugly girl! I made high-pitched noises like a crazed animal, trying to scratch out the face in the mirror. And then I saw what seemed to be the prodigy side of me because I had never seen that face before. I looked at my reflection, blinking so I could see more clearly. The girl staring back at me was angry, powerful. This girl and I were the same. I had new thoughts, willful thoughts, or rather thoughts filled with lots of won'ts. I won't let her change me, promised myself. I won't be what I'm not. -Excerpted from "Two kinds" in The Joy Luck Club by Amy Tan Based on the passage, what do you think is a valid conclusion? A. The girl promises herself that she will make every effort to please her mother  B. The girl enjoys memorizing passages from the Bible.C. The girl changes from feeling sad to feeling powerful D. The girl decides to be true to herself.​</h2><br />

                            7. Elephant and Friends A lone elephant wandered the forest looking for friends. She came across a monkey and asked, “Will you be my friend, monkey?” “You are too big and cannot swing on trees as I do. So, I cannot be your friend”, said the monkey. The elephant them came across a rabbit and asked him if she could be his friend. “You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot be my friend”, replied the rabbit. Then the elephant met a frog and asked if she could be her friend. The frog said “You are too big and heavy. You cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you cannot be my friend”. The elephant asked a fox, and he got the same reply, that he was too big. The next day, all the animals in the forest were running in fear. The elephant stopped a bear and asked what was happening and was told that a tiger has been attacking all the animals. The elephant wanted to save the other weak animals and went to the tiger and said “Please sir, leave my friends alone. Do not eat them”. The tiger didn’t listen and asked the elephant to mind her own business. Seeing no other way to solve the problem, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared it away. She then went back to the others and told them what happened. On hearing how the elephant saved their lives, the animals agreed in unison, “You are just the right size to be our friend”. QUESTIONS: 1. Where was the elephant wandering? 2. Why was the elephant in the forest? 3. Who were the animals who came across him? 4, Why do these animals don’t want him to be a friend? 5. How did the elephant help the animals? If you were the elephant, would you do the same? Why or why not?​</h2><br />

The monkey did not want to be her (The Elephant) friend because that she is too big and can't swing on trees as the monkey can. The Rabbit did not want to be her (The Elephant) friend because that she is too big too fit inside the Rabbit's burrow. The frog did not want to be her (The Elephant) friend because that she is too big, heavy and cannot jump as the frog. The fox had the same reason as tge other 3 animals.</p><p>5.

a carton of fresh milk with me, so I looked for a saucer and gave some milk to the kitten. We saw
how hungry it was as it drank the milk. Argie then gave a piece of her fish for the kitten to eat
together with the milk. Afterward, we went inside to eat our meal.
Before we returned to our classroom, we checked on the kitten and found it sleeping
peacefully. We decided that we would check on it every day and gave it the name “Prim."

Elephant and Friends A lone elephant wandered the forest looking for friends. She came across a monkey and asked, "Will you be my friend, monkey?" "You are too big and cannot swing on trees as I do. So, I cannot be your friend", said the monkey. The elephant them came across a rabbit and asked him if she could be his friend. "You are too big to fit inside my burrow. You cannot be my friend", replied the rabbit. Then the elephant met a frog and asked if she could be her friend. The frog said "You are too big and heavy. You cannot jump like me. I am sorry, but you cannot be my friend". The elephant asked a fox, and he got the same reply, that he was too big. The next day, all the animals in the forest were running in fear. The elephant stopped a bear and asked what was happening and was told that a tiger has been attacking all the animals. The elephant wanted to save the other weak animals and went to the tiger and said "Please sir, leave my friends alone. Do not eat them". The tiger didn't listen and asked the elephant to mind her own business. Seeing no other way to solve the problem, the elephant kicked the tiger and scared it away. She then went back to the others and told them what happened. On hearing how the elephant saved their lives, the animals agreed in unison, "You are just the right size to be our friend". QUESTIONS: 1. Where was the elephant wandering? 2. Why was the elephant in the forest? 3. Who were the animals who came across him? 4, Why do these animals don't want him to be a friend? 5. How did the elephant help the animals? If you were the elephant, would you do the same? Why or why not?​</h2><br />
