                        1. Demand and supply are equal.<strong>Equilibrium</strong> is the point where demand for a product equals the quantity supplied. This means that there's no surplus and no shortage of goods. A shortage occurs when demand exceeds supply – in other words, when the price is too low.<p></p>2. Businesses lay of workers due to high price of labor and other inputs. <strong>Higher</strong> <strong>labor</strong> <strong>cost</strong><strong>s</strong> (higher wage rates and employee benefits) make workers better off, but they can reduce companies' profits, the number of jobs, and the hours each person works. The minimum wage, overtime pay, payroll taxes, and hiring subsidies are just a few of the policies that affect labor costs.<p></p>3. Buyers and sellers determine the prices of commodities.In any market transaction between a seller and a buyer, the price of the good or service is determined by <strong>supply</strong><strong> </strong><strong>and</strong><strong> </strong><strong>demand</strong><strong> </strong><strong>in</strong> <strong>a</strong> <strong>market</strong>. Supply and demand are in turn determined by technology and the conditions under which people operate.<p></p>4. Demand is greater than supply. Economists call this an “excess demand” – the quantity demanded is greater than the quantity supplied at the given price. This is also called <strong>a</strong><strong> </strong><strong>shortage</strong>.<p></p>5. The sellers have not been successful in the clearing the market of surplus goods for a long time already.If a surplus exist, price must fall in order to entice additional quantity demanded and reduce quantity supplied until the surplus is eliminated. If a shortage exists, price must rise in order to entice additional supply and reduce quantity demanded until the shortage is eliminated.<p></p>6. Severe market shortage exists in the economy. When a shortage exists in a market, sellers: raise price, which decreases quantity demanded and increases quantity supplied until the shortage is eliminated. The unique point at which the supply and demand curves intersect is called: equilibrium.<p></p>7. Supply is greater than demandIn economics, an excess supply, economic surplus market surplus or briefly surply is a situation in which the quantity of a good or service supplied is more than the quantity demanded, and the price is above the equilibrium level determined by supply and demand.<p></p><p></p>8. The Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Board determine the minimum wage. The Act established a new mechanism for minimum wage determination through the creation of the National Wages and Productivity Commission (NWPC) and the Regional Tripartite Wages and Productivity Boards (RTWPBs) in all regions of the country.<p></p><p></p>9. The government controls the prices of prime commodities "(8) 'Prime Commodities' are goods not considered as basic necessities but are essential to consumers in times of any of the cases provided under Section 7 of this Act such as, but not limited to, flour; dried, processed or canned pork, beef and poultry meat; dairy products not falling under basic necessities; onions, ...<p></p>10. The government distributes market coupons to consumers. Loyalty Building That way, every time customers complete a purchase in your place of business, they are handed an offer encouraging them to make a return visit. The psychology behind this coupon strategy is evident: Giving a deal to happy customers will make them even happier—and spendier.<p></p><p><strong>H</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>it</strong><strong> </strong><strong>helps</strong><strong> </strong></p><p><strong>Carry</strong><strong> </strong><strong>on</strong><strong> </strong><strong>learning</strong></p><p><strong>Brainly</strong><strong> </strong><strong>everyday</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Bacteria are a type of biological cell. They constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats.  </p><p></p><p>2.Bacteria are classified into five groups according to their basic shapes: spherical (cocci), rod (bacilli), spiral (spirilla), comma (vibrios) or corkscrew (spirochaetes). They can exist as single cells, in pairs, chains or clusters.</p><p></p><p>3.Fimbriae are straight and non-helical in nature. Flagella are helical and non-straight in nature. Fimbriae are comparatively shorter in length than flagella. Flagella are many times longer than fimbriae.</p><p></p><p>4.Gram positive bacteria have cell walls composed mostly of a substance unique to bacteria known as peptidoglycan, or murein. ... Gram negative bacteria have cell walls with only a thin layer of peptidoglycan and an outer membrane with a lipopolysaccharide component not found in Gram positive bacteria.</p><p></p><p>5.Many bacterial cells secrete some extracellular material in the form of a capsule or a slime layer. A slime layer is loosely associated with the bacterium and can be easily washed off, whereas a capsule is attached tightly to the bacterium and has definite boundaries.</p><p></p><p>6.A nucleus is a membrane-bound structure in which eukaryotes assemble their genetic materials. Nucleoid is a particular area in which prokaryotes assemble their genetic materials. A nucleus is well organised and is large.
