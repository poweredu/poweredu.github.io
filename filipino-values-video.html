Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

Ang Pipit Lyrics - Philippine Folk Songs
by: Levi Celerio
May pumukol sa Pipit sa sanga ng ng isang kahoy
At nahagip ng bato ang pakpak ng munting ibon
Dahil sa sakit,
di nakaya pang lumipad
At ang nangyari ay nahulog ngunit parang taong bumigkas
Mamang kay lupit, ang puso mo'y di na nahabag
Pag pumanaw ang buhay ko,
may isang pipit na iiyak (2x)
Texts on Video (TRANSCRIPTION):
 “Ang Pipit” is a popular Filipino song about a bird that is known in Tagalog as a pipit. Many Filipinos don’t realize that
it’s an English word too, so they force-translate the song’s title as “My Sparrow”. The pipit is a bird in the family
Motacillidae.
 The key signature of the song is in A minor.
 Our group has decided to use instruments that are not commonly used.
 Levi Celerio (April 20,1910 – April2, 2002) is a Filipino composer and lyricist. He received a scholarship to the Academy
of Music in Manila and becomes the youngest member of the Manila Symphony Orchestra.
 He wrote several numbers of songs for local movies, which earned him the Lifetime Achievement Award of the film
Academy of the Philippines. Celerio has written for more than 4,000 Filipino folk, Christmas, and love songs including
many that became movie titles.
 Celerio is probably best recognized for being leaf-player, an achievement where he was place into the Guinness Book
of World Records as the only man who could play music with a leaf. On October 9, 1997, he was proclaimed National
Artist for Music and Literature. His citation read that his music “was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.”
 He died at Delgado Clinic in Quezon City on April 2, 2002 at the age of 91.
 He was awarded the title of the national artist for music and literature in 1997 by Philippine President Fidel Ramos who
cited the prolific lyricist and composer for writing music that was a perfect embodiment of the heartfelt sentiments and
valued traditions of the Filipino.
 In this song, a bird has her wing injured by a rock thrown by a man, likely from a slingshot. The bird was so hurt, she
couldn’t fly. Like a person she spoke up, “Oh cruel man. How pitiless your heart is? If I die, there is pipit bird who will cry.”
 Considering how plaintively sad the theme and word are of this folk song, it’s slightly incongruous with contemporary
sensibilities that most canonical interpretations of the melody, such as by Pilita Corales and the Mabuhay Singers, are
very upbeat. It’s almost like gleefully making fun of a helpless creature in deep throes of pain.
 The Pipit is a metaphorical representation of how our country gets abused and abandoned.

Answer the following questions:
1. What message does the lyricist, Levi Celerio, convey in his song?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>ctto:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>the famous filipino folk song "ang pipit" has a sad story. if we will try to interpet the lyrics literally, it talks about a bird who was hit by a stone. the poor creature was unable to fly because of the pain and the severity of the injury so it fell from the tree. but before it hit the ground, it expresses its worry that another bird will be sad by the former's demise and that the man was too cruel for taking an innocent living being's life.
