Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus:The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________Easy Warm-up: ________________________Fire Starter: ________________________Audience Reader:_________________________2. GOLBAL WARMING:Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects.POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________EASY WARM-UP:_________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________AUDIENCE READER:_____________________3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ______________________FIRE STARTER: ________________________AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence,POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________EASY WARM-UP:______________________FIRE STARTER:________________________AUDIENCE READER:___________________​</a>

                                            Cardiovascular disease is now among the leading causes of death in Africa as the numbers keep getting higher. This is a cause for worry as hypertension and related diseases not only affect the health of the general public, but also impact negatively on economic growth as people become sick and unable to work or die leaving their families in poverty. Africa can succeed in the fight against hypertension if there are sustainable and effective best practices as well as community-based programs that encourage both early screening and treatment of hypertension. There needs to be a concerted effort to educate the masses about hypertension, what causes it and how to prevent or treat the disease. Prevention and control of hypertension in Africa requires formulation of policies and careful implementation via a multi-sectoral model and close cooperation that brings together government bodies as well as other stakeholders in the health industry. As we celebrate the gains the continent has achieved, it is important to ensure that diseases such as hypertension are kept at bay. It is time for Africans to realize that times have changed and lifestyle diseases are here with us. Experts encourage people to eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, and avoid stress as some of the simple measures that can help to keep hypertension at bay.

                            8. Cardiovascular disease is now among the leading causes of death in Africa as the numbers keep getting higher. This is a cause for worry as hypertension and related diseases not only affect the health of the general public, but also impact negatively on economic growth as people become sick and unable to work or die leaving their families in poverty. Africa can succeed in the fight against hypertension if there are sustainable and effective best practices as well as community-based programs that encourage both early screening and treatment of hypertension. There needs to be a concerted effort to educate the masses about hypertension, what causes it and how to prevent or treat the disease. Prevention and control of hypertension in Africa requires formulation of policies and careful implementation via a multi-sectoral model and close cooperation that brings together government bodies as well as other stakeholders in the health industry. As we celebrate the gains the continent has achieved, it is important to ensure that diseases such as hypertension are kept at bay. It is time for Africans to realize that times have changed and lifestyle diseases are here with us. Experts encourage people to eat healthy foods, exercise regularly, and avoid stress as some of the simple measures that can help to keep hypertension at bay.

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>POSITIVE IMPACTS OF GLOBALIZATION </p><p>1. Gives Access to a Larger Market</p><p>Through globalization countries and companies have access to a bigger consumer base. Instead of only selling products in their country a business can expand to other regions boosting sales and in the process making more money.</p><p></p><p>2. Provides Cheaper Goods for Consumers</p><p>Because of globalization a lot of companies are moving to areas where their cost of production is low they, in turn, offer cheaper products because they are not expensive to make hence lower prices for consumers.</p><p></p><p>3. Globalization Wets Countries do what They do Best</p><p>For example, a country can buy cheap steel from another country instead of making its own steel. They can then focus their efforts on making other things they are good at like computers and export them to the countries they import cheap steal from.</p><p></p><p>NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF GLOBALIZATION</p><p>1. Causes Environmental Damage</p><p>Globalization has led to increased production for businesses in order to meet global demand. Increased production means more natural resources are used and this can be used up before they are regenerated leading to a negative impact on the environment.Also in developing countries rules and regulations on environmental protection are not as strict as in developed countries. This has seen some multinationals leave their countries to set up in developing countries to take advantage of this lax regulation in the process they manufacture products that are harmful to the environment.</p><p></p><p>2. Causes Fluctuation of Prices</p><p>Increased competition means that businesses with the best prices win. Due to competition prices are always fluctuating, for example, a country like the US has to reduce its prices often to compete with prices for the same product coming from China.</p><p></p><p>3. Job Insecurity</p><p></p><p></p><p>Globalization provides a double-edged sword when it comes to jobs. It creates jobs for people in developing countries who provide cheaper manufacturing jobs. For example, many companies are setting up in India and China because wages and manufacturing jobs are cheaper there which means fewer opportunities in developed worlds.</p><p></p><p>In short, globalization takes jobs from one country and provides them to another. This can be negative or positive depending on what part of the world you are in.</p><br />

                        <p>One negative effect of globalization in education is the potential loss of cultural identity and diversity. As education becomes more standardized and globalized, there is a risk of losing local traditions, languages, and knowledge systems that are unique to specific cultures. This can lead to a homogenization of education and a loss of appreciation for the diversity of human experiences and perspectives. Additionally, the emphasis on standardized testing and curriculum can limit creativity and critical thinking skills in students.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Lack of regulation</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>It is extremely difficult to regulate the trade in academic institutions, programs, degrees or products across international borders. Lack of regulation is a major issue with the globalisation of higher education.</p><br />

                            16. Role of Globalization in Education
Directions: Write a three-paragraph essay about the positive and negative effect of globalization in education by answering the following questions.
1. Introduction: What is your own concept of globalization and global education?
2. Body: What are the positive and negative effect of globalization to education?
3. Conclusion: What is your opinionabout globalization and globaleducation. Do you agree or disagree? Why?</h2><br />
                        <p></p><p>Linguists assume that global education is strongly bounded to the globalization process that the world is witnessing. They clarify that pedagogy is a very effective tool to spread and instill global values in students who need to identify themselves with the new world outside their own.</p><p></p><p>As a result, there are a number of positives associated with globalization: it creates greater opportunities for firms in less industrialized countries to tap into more and larger markets around the world. this can lead to more access to capital flows, technology, human capital, cheaper imports and larger export.   Negative Effects of Globalization. It has had a few adverse effects on developed countries. Some adverse consequences of globalization include terrorism, job insecurity, currency fluctuation, and price instability.A global education is one that incorporates learning about the cultures, geographies, histories, and current issues of all the world's regions. It emphasizes the interconnectedness and diversity of peoples and histories</p><p></p><p>Technological Innovation is another notable contribution of Globalization. Most noteworthy, there is a huge emphasis on technology development in Globalization. Furthermore, there is also technology transfer due to Globalization. The technology would certainly benefit the common people.</p><p></p><p>The quality of products improves due to Globalization. This is because manufacturers try to make products of high-quality. This is due to the pressure of intense competition. If the product is inferior, people can easily switch to another high-quality product.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />

Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus: The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________ Easy Warm-up: ________________________ Fire Starter: ________________________ Audience Reader:_________________________ 2. GOLBAL WARMING: Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects. POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________ EASY WARM-UP:_________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ______________________ FIRE STARTER: ________________________ AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence, POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________ EASY WARM-UP:______________________ FIRE STARTER:________________________ AUDIENCE READER:___________________Dito na lang Po pa answer&lt;3​</h2><br />
