This aims to provide an avenue for PWDs (Persons with Disability) to look for employment opportunities that match their skills and abilities. Unlike conventional recruitment that places high value in one's educational attainment, the project ensured that the hiring process will be based mainly on skills and abilities that can match what employers need in their company. In your opinion, what do projects like this say about the state of PWDs in the Philippines? ​</a>
