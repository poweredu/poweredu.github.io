There is really no denying it. Goldfish, hamsters, and cats do not compare. "What makes dogs so great?" you mightask. That's easy. They are affectionate, smart, and easy to care for.If you have a tough day at school, what do you want to come home to? Do you want to come home to a cat that just looks at you, bored, until youfeed it? No way! How about coming home to a loving dog instead? If you are sad, a good dog will comfort you right away. A dog will jump up on your lap and lick your face until you can't help but smile. Dogs are also super smart! They can play fun games, like fetch. This also means that they are easy to train. You can teach your dog to use the bathroom outside. Most dogs learnthis pretty fast and don't forget it. You can also teach a dog some tricks. With some patience and a couple treats, you can train your dog to put on a show.Last, dogs are easy to take care of. As long as you feed them, love them, and train them, caring for a dog is a breeze. You don't have to worry about cleaning out a dirty litter box or fishbowl. If you are thinking about getting a new pet, you should choose a dog. After all, they are man's best friend.1.

Dogs Rule                by: Luke See    Dogs are the greatest pets ever. There is really no denying it. Goldfish, hamsters, and cats do not compare. "What makes dogs so great?" you mightask. That's easy. They are affectionate, smart, and easy to care for.    If you have a tough day at school, what do you want to come home to? Do you want to come home to a cat that just looks at you, bored, until youfeed it? No way! How about coming home to a loving dog instead? If you are sad, a good dog will comfort you right away. A dog will jump up on your lap and lick your face until you can't help but smile. Dogs are also super smart! They can play fun games, like fetch. This also means that they are easy to train. You can teach your dog to use the bathroom outside. Most dogs learnthis pretty fast and don't forget it. You can also teach a dog some tricks. With some patience and a couple treats, you can train your dog to put on a show.     Last, dogs are easy to take care of. As long as you feed them, love them, and train them, caring for a dog is a breeze. You don't have to worry about cleaning out a dirty litter box or fishbowl. If you are thinking about getting a new pet, you should choose a dog. After all, they are man's best friend.1. What is the author's point of view expressed in the selection?2-4.

Goldfish, hamsters, and cats do not compare. "What makes dogs so great?" you mightask. That's easy. They are affectionate, smart, and easy to care for.If you have a tough day at school, what do you want to come home to? Do you want to come home to a cat that just looks at you, bored, until youfeed it? No way! How about coming home to a loving dog instead? If you are sad, a good dog will comfort you right away. A dog will jump up on your lap and lick your face until you can't help but smile. Dogs are also super smart! They can play fun games, like fetch. This also means that they are easy to train. You can teach your dog to use the bathroom outside. Most dogs learnthis pretty fast and don't forget it. You can also teach a dog some tricks. With some patience and a couple treats, you can train your dog to put on a show.Last, dogs are easy to take care of. As long as you feed them, love them, and train them, caring for a dog is a breeze. You don't have to worry about cleaning out a dirty litter box or fishbowl. If you are thinking about getting a new pet, you should choose a dog. After all, they are man's best friend.1.

Dogs Rule                by: Luke See    Dogs are the greatest pets ever. There is really no denying it. Goldfish, hamsters, and cats do not compare. "What makes dogs so great?" you mightask. That's easy. They are affectionate, smart, and easy to care for.    If you have a tough day at school, what do you want to come home to? Do you want to come home to a cat that just looks at you, bored, until youfeed it? No way! How about coming home to a loving dog instead? If you are sad, a good dog will comfort you right away. A dog will jump up on your lap and lick your face until you can't help but smile. Dogs are also super smart! They can play fun games, like fetch. This also means that they are easy to train. You can teach your dog to use the bathroom outside. Most dogs learnthis pretty fast and don't forget it. You can also teach a dog some tricks. With some patience and a couple treats, you can train your dog to put on a show.     Last, dogs are easy to take care of. As long as you feed them, love them, and train them, caring for a dog is a breeze. You don't have to worry about cleaning out a dirty litter box or fishbowl. If you are thinking about getting a new pet, you should choose a dog. After all, they are man's best friend.1. What is the author's point of view expressed in the selection?2-4.
