                                            The Value of Peopleby Jim JohnsonWhen I worked as an errand boy at a big store, a rich lady came in and bought a veryexpensive Chinese vase. As I went off to deliver it, the boss gave me a stern warning to beextra careful. I found the lady's mansion, and just as I was squeezing in through a half-opengate, I heard something break inside the parcel. I went pale with fear. I wanted to run awayJust then the large mansion door opened and an elderly lady came out I was veryworried about what I was going to tell her, when suddenly a large playful shepherd dog camebounding across the lawn and jumping right on top of me, knocking the vase to the ground witha smashing sound. The lady came hurrying over, while the dog licked my face. Excitedly, sheasked, "For heaven's sake, lad, I hope you're not hurt."And then I started, "About the vase, I just wanted to tell you..." But I never got to say it"Oh, the vase?" she said. "That's nothing to worry about... But how about you? Youknow, that dog is still young and probably thought you wanted to play with him... Are youalright?"Well, she gave me a good tip for bringing the vase. And I patted the dog on the head. Hehad been my savior.I can never forget that lady, who thought more about me than that valuable vase.Learning Task:Directions. Answer the following questions below. Write your answer on the line.1.

I hope this task will help you explain the importance of focusing specimens using a compound microscope. Read the four different scenarios carefully and answer the question that follows on a separate paper. What Will You Do? Scenario 1: A student is tasked to observe a leaf under a microscope. She cut a small piece, put it on the slide and covered it with a cover slip. She then tried to use the scanning objective, focused the specimen using the coarse knob and switched to low power objective. She focused the specimen using a high power objective, but she cannot see the specimen very well. What do you think is wrong with the procedure? Scenario 2: You are focusing a specimen using a coarse adjustment knob in a high power objective. What do you think will happen? Scenario 3: The world is now experiencing a pandemic because of the newly discovered coronavirus. The Corona Virus Disease (COVID 19) affects the respiratory system of the body. How will your knowledge on using a microscope help in solving this pandemic? Scenario 4: If you are given a chance to observe and discover something, what would it be? How can it help the community?​</a>

Epistle from Mother Earth
by Maricon V. Estrellado
Four billions of years ago, when i was born in the midst of the vast blanket of the unknown, I was really gung-ho when human babies were born to make me as their beloved home. 
My oceans are like gigantic rucksacks of foods, goods and treasures for your pleasures. 
My trees extend their canopies bearing fruits and giving comfy shades for your siestas amd rests. 
My highland-spots near the outstretched curtains of bluish sky become your rendezvous of socialization and a series of "hi" I became an aficionado of anthropology as I witness how you adapt and evolve through these years. There just something that bothers me, an appeal of mutualism between you and me. 
Can you be aficionados of environmentalism too?

                                            Pandemic: A Message of HopeWe slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized thatParis is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyonesleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparentsbecame an act of love,Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not thatvaluable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one willever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties.Enjoy our life when we have one.The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve aroundis so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we arefinally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home andfamily that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent ourtime, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things wecherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were neverreally grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest ofreminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look withinourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunityto heal.Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thingthat it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through,learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us alltogether like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positiveor optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or bethe light in the darkness that everyone wants to see.If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a littlelonger, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that stillhas hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.Questions;1.Which parts of that motivational speech (sentences or paragraphs) you have given more emphasis when you delivered it?2. How did you give emphasis on those parts?  why?3. Were you able to effectively deliver the speech verbally (tone,volume,and speed of voices, filters, pauses, and pronounciation)?4. Were you able to effectively deliver the speech non-verbally (body movements, facial expressions, eye contacts, gestures, posture, and mastery)?5.

                                            Pandemic: A Message of Hope We slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized that Paris is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyone sleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparents became an act of love, Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not that valuable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one will ever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties. Enjoy our life when we have one. The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve around is so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we are finally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home and family that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent our time, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things we cherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were never really grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest of reminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look within ourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunity to heal. Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thing that it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through, learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us all together like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positive or optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or be the light in the darkness that everyone wants to see. If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a little longer, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that still has hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.

                                            What I Can Do Now, let us try to apply your learnings on formulating evaluative statements. A. Directions: Form an evaluative statement for every given text and label it whether positive or negative depending on the focus of the evaluation. See the sample below. Text: If you are not so smart, you should try to be a teacher. Evaluative Statement: The statement is very discriminatory against those with average intelligence and teachers in general. Example: Negative 1. In this time of pandemic, people should give all the blames to the government for the insufficient assistance given to them. 2. Every person has something to contribute to win the battle against COVID-19. 3. If you got infected by the Corona Virus, you should not lose hope but be positive about it. 4. If you are a student with no internet connection at home, you better not enroll for this school year while we are in these trying times. 5. When you go out of your house to buy essential things, you must follow the minimum health protocols like social distancing, wearing mask, using alcohol or sanitizer, and washing hands.​</a>

                            6. The Value of Peopleby Jim JohnsonWhen I worked as an errand boy at a big store, a rich lady came in and bought a veryexpensive Chinese vase. As I went off to deliver it, the boss gave me a stern warning to beextra careful. I found the lady's mansion, and just as I was squeezing in through a half-opengate, I heard something break inside the parcel. I went pale with fear. I wanted to run awayJust then the large mansion door opened and an elderly lady came out I was veryworried about what I was going to tell her, when suddenly a large playful shepherd dog camebounding across the lawn and jumping right on top of me, knocking the vase to the ground witha smashing sound. The lady came hurrying over, while the dog licked my face. Excitedly, sheasked, "For heaven's sake, lad, I hope you're not hurt."And then I started, "About the vase, I just wanted to tell you..." But I never got to say it"Oh, the vase?" she said. "That's nothing to worry about... But how about you? Youknow, that dog is still young and probably thought you wanted to play with him... Are youalright?"Well, she gave me a good tip for bringing the vase. And I patted the dog on the head. Hehad been my savior.I can never forget that lady, who thought more about me than that valuable vase.Learning Task:Directions. Answer the following questions below. Write your answer on the line.1.

                            7. I hope you learned a lot from this lesson. Now, it is time to apply what you have learned. I hope this task will help you explain the importance of focusing specimens using a compound microscope. Read the four different scenarios carefully and answer the question that follows on a separate paper. What Will You Do? Scenario 1: A student is tasked to observe a leaf under a microscope. She cut a small piece, put it on the slide and covered it with a cover slip. She then tried to use the scanning objective, focused the specimen using the coarse knob and switched to low power objective. She focused the specimen using a high power objective, but she cannot see the specimen very well. What do you think is wrong with the procedure? Scenario 2: You are focusing a specimen using a coarse adjustment knob in a high power objective. What do you think will happen? Scenario 3: The world is now experiencing a pandemic because of the newly discovered coronavirus. The Corona Virus Disease (COVID 19) affects the respiratory system of the body. How will your knowledge on using a microscope help in solving this pandemic? Scenario 4: If you are given a chance to observe and discover something, what would it be? How can it help the community?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Scenario 1:</p><p></p><p>There are different reasons. It might be because of the amount of light that passes through the lens. If this is the case, adjust the diaphragm to reach the right amount of light needed to properly observe the specimen It can also be that specimen might be too thick that the light cannot pass through it. In this situation, scrape the leaf to achieve the thinness of the specimen that is enough for the light to pass through it.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 2: When using a high power objective, it is important to remember NOT TO USE the coarse adjustment knob because it might break the cover slip or the glass slide itself. It would ruin the specimen.</p><p></p><p>Scenario 3:</p><p> With my knowledge on using a microscope, I would study the genetic material of the virus to know how it reproduces and how it can be killed.</p><br />

Epistle from Mother Earth
by Maricon V. Estrellado
Four billions of years ago, when i was born in the midst of the vast blanket of the unknown, I was really gung-ho when human babies were born to make me as their beloved home. 
My oceans are like gigantic rucksacks of foods, goods and treasures for your pleasures. 
My trees extend their canopies bearing fruits and giving comfy shades for your siestas amd rests. 
My highland-spots near the outstretched curtains of bluish sky become your rendezvous of socialization and a series of "hi" I became an aficionado of anthropology as I witness how you adapt and evolve through these years. There just something that bothers me, an appeal of mutualism between you and me. 
Can you be aficionados of environmentalism too?

                            13. Pandemic: A Message of HopeWe slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized thatParis is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyonesleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparentsbecame an act of love,Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not thatvaluable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one willever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties.Enjoy our life when we have one.The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve aroundis so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we arefinally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home andfamily that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent ourtime, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things wecherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were neverreally grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest ofreminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look withinourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunityto heal.Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thingthat it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through,learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us alltogether like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positiveor optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or bethe light in the darkness that everyone wants to see.If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a littlelonger, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that stillhas hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.Questions;1.Which parts of that motivational speech (sentences or paragraphs) you have given more emphasis when you delivered it?2.

                            28. Pandemic: A Message of Hope We slept in one world, and we woke up in other. Suddenly we realized that Paris is no linger romantic, Disney has no more magic, and in New York, everyone sleeps. Hugs and kisses became weapons, and not visiting parents and grandparents became an act of love, Suddenly we realized that money is not that powerful, and power is not that valuable. Why is everything so uncertain in this world? I do not know. No one will ever know, but I do know one thing that we do not need to focus on the uncertainties. Enjoy our life when we have one. The situation has taught us that everything our lives used to revolve around is so temporary. Work, ayms, malls, and movies have all gone for a toss as we are finally learning to live without them. It has taught us that it's our own home and family that keeps us safe. We finally learned the fact that it's not how we spent our time, but who we spent it with. But I wonder, are we still walking by the things we cherish the most? We used to be consumed in our everyday lives that we were never really grateful for what we had, but now that we have received the harshest of reminders, we don't need to keep running anymore. We can finally look within ourselves and connect with our soul. It's like the universe is giving us the opportunity to heal. Now, I do not know when this will end. No one does, but I do know one thing that it will end one day, and that day we will all look back at what we've gone through, learned, and survived. We saw humanity at its best, and how it brought us all together like never before. I know it can be extremely hard for anyone to be positive or optimistic right now, but we still have a choice. We can either spread fear or be the light in the darkness that everyone wants to see. If you still cannot find something to hold onto, take a mirror, stand a little longer, and stare a little harder. You will find something deep inside of you that still has hope, faith, and human spirit in these times of disruption, tragedy, and chaos.

                            30. What I Can Do Now, let us try to apply your learnings on formulating evaluative statements. A. Directions: Form an evaluative statement for every given text and label it whether positive or negative depending on the focus of the evaluation. See the sample below. Text: If you are not so smart, you should try to be a teacher. Evaluative Statement: The statement is very discriminatory against those with average intelligence and teachers in general. Example: Negative 1. In this time of pandemic, people should give all the blames to the government for the insufficient assistance given to them. 2. Every person has something to contribute to win the battle against COVID-19. 3. If you got infected by the Corona Virus, you should not lose hope but be positive about it. 4. If you are a student with no internet connection at home, you better not enroll for this school year while we are in these trying times. 5. When you go out of your house to buy essential things, you must follow the minimum health protocols like social distancing, wearing mask, using alcohol or sanitizer, and washing hands.​</h2><br />
