                                            Banking on Development Fueled by the 1973 spike in oil prices engineered by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the offshore capital marker grew from $315 billion in 1973 to $2,055 billion in 1982. The seven largest US banks saw their overseas profits climb from 22 to 60 percent of their total profits in the same time period. By the end of 1970s, trade in foreign exchange was more than 11 times the value of world commodity trade. The instability of currencies, and therefore of profitability conditions, forced TNCs to diversify their global operations to reduce their risk. In this way, the financial revolution, combined with a flood of petrodollars, consolidated a global production system. With the First World in an oil price-induced recession, global banks turned to Third World governments, eager to borrow and considered unlikely to default. By encouraging massive borrowing, the banks brokered the 1970s expansion in the middle-income Third World countries, now the world economic growth engine. In the early 1970s, bank loans accounted for only 13 percent of third world debt, while multilateral loans made up more than 33 percent. At the end of the decade, the composition of these figures had reversed, with banks holding about 60 percent of the debt. Willing private lenders represented a golden opportunity for Third World states some autonomy from the official financial community. By 1984, all nine largest US banks were lending more than 100 percent of their shareholders' equity in loans to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela, while lloyds of london lent staggering 165 percent of its capital to such countries. Loans typically served several functions. Political elites sought to legitimize rule with grand public development projects represented in nationalist terms, to strengthen their militaries, and to enrich their patronage networks with lucrative contracts resulting from loans. In Brazil between 1964 and 1985, a string of military generals pursued the characteristic Latin American nationalist model, using loans to build the public sector steel, energy, and raw material production, with debt financing, Brazil transformed itself a country earning 70 precent of its exporter revenue from one commodity into a major producer and exporter of a multiplicity of industrial goods-including steel, aluminum, petrochemicals, cement glass, armaments, and aircraft and processed foodstuff such as orange juice and soybean meal. As a result, Rio de Janeiro and saõ paulo have new subway systems, railroads take ore from huge mines deep in the interior to new ports, and major cities are linked by modern telecommunications network.

                            10. Banking on Development Fueled by the 1973 spike in oil prices engineered by the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), the offshore capital marker grew from $315 billion in 1973 to $2,055 billion in 1982. The seven largest US banks saw their overseas profits climb from 22 to 60 percent of their total profits in the same time period. By the end of 1970s, trade in foreign exchange was more than 11 times the value of world commodity trade. The instability of currencies, and therefore of profitability conditions, forced TNCs to diversify their global operations to reduce their risk. In this way, the financial revolution, combined with a flood of petrodollars, consolidated a global production system. With the First World in an oil price-induced recession, global banks turned to Third World governments, eager to borrow and considered unlikely to default. By encouraging massive borrowing, the banks brokered the 1970s expansion in the middle-income Third World countries, now the world economic growth engine. In the early 1970s, bank loans accounted for only 13 percent of third world debt, while multilateral loans made up more than 33 percent. At the end of the decade, the composition of these figures had reversed, with banks holding about 60 percent of the debt. Willing private lenders represented a golden opportunity for Third World states some autonomy from the official financial community. By 1984, all nine largest US banks were lending more than 100 percent of their shareholders' equity in loans to Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, and Venezuela, while lloyds of london lent staggering 165 percent of its capital to such countries. Loans typically served several functions. Political elites sought to legitimize rule with grand public development projects represented in nationalist terms, to strengthen their militaries, and to enrich their patronage networks with lucrative contracts resulting from loans. In Brazil between 1964 and 1985, a string of military generals pursued the characteristic Latin American nationalist model, using loans to build the public sector steel, energy, and raw material production, with debt financing, Brazil transformed itself a country earning 70 precent of its exporter revenue from one commodity into a major producer and exporter of a multiplicity of industrial goods-including steel, aluminum, petrochemicals, cement glass, armaments, and aircraft and processed foodstuff such as orange juice and soybean meal. As a result, Rio de Janeiro and saõ paulo have new subway systems, railroads take ore from huge mines deep in the interior to new ports, and major cities are linked by modern telecommunications network.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Ang tekstong "Banking on Development" ay nagbibigay ng overview ng relasyon sa pagitan ng global financial system at ang paglago ng mga bansang Third World sa panahon ng 1970s at 1980s. Ang artikulo ay nagpapaliwanag kung paano ang financial revolution, na fueled sa pagtaas ng presyo ng langis dahil sa OPEC, nagdulot sa paglago ng offshore capital market. Ang paglago na ito ay nagdulot sa pagtaas ng kita para sa mga pinakamalaking bangko sa Estados Unidos, na nagdulot din sa pagtaas ng pagpapautang sa mga bansang Third World.</p><p></p><p>Ang teksto ay nagpapaliwanag na ang instability ng currency at profitability conditions ay nagdulot sa diversification ng mga global operation ng transnational corporations, na nag-consolidate ng isang global production system. Sa panahon ng recession sa First World, ang mga bangko ay nakita ang opportunity na magpautang ng pera sa mga gobyerno ng Third World, na eager magutang at hindi inaasahan na hindi makabayad. Sa katapusan ng dekada, ang bank loans ay accounted para sa majority ng debt ng Third World.</p><p></p><p>Ang artikulo ay nagpapaliwanag kung paano ang willingness ng private lenders na magbigay ng mga loan ay nagbigay ng autonomy sa mga estado ng Third World mula sa official financial community. Ang mga bangko sa Estados Unidos at Lloyds of London ay nagpapautang ng higit sa 100% ng kanilang capital sa mga bansa tulad ng Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, at Venezuela. Ang mga loan ay nagserve ng multiple functions, kabilang ang mga political goal tulad ng paglegitimize ng rule at pagpapalakas ng patronage network sa pamamagitan ng lucrative contracts. Ang artikulo ay nagbibigay ng halimbawa ng Brazil, na nagtransform sa sarili mula sa isang bansa na kumikita ng 70% ng kanilang export revenue mula sa isang commodity sa isang major producer at exporter ng iba't ibang industrial goods, tulad ng steel, aluminum, petrochemicals, at processed foodstuffs.</p><p></p><p>Sa konklusyon, ang teksto ay nag-highlight sa relasyon sa pagitan ng global financial system at ang paglago ng mga bansang Third World, at kung paano ang financial revolution, na fueled sa pagtaas ng presyo ng langis, ay nagdulot sa pagtaas ng pagpapautang sa mga bansang ito, na nagtransform sa kanilang mga ekonomiya at infrastructure.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Loans were used by political leaders in Brazil between 1964 and 1985 to achieve different goals. They used loans to build public projects, strengthen their military, and make money for their friends through contracts. These loans helped Brazil turn into a major producer and exporter of industrial goods such as steel, aluminum, petrochemicals, and processed foods. As a result, Brazil has better transportation systems and improved communication networks.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I hope this is a bit clearer</p><br />

                            13. petrochemicals were invented as substitutes for natural materials. how feasible is the notion that we should go back to using only natural materials?​</h2><br />
                        <p>The effects of petrochemicals are not only bad for the environment but also for our health. Based on the research, exposure to petrochemicals may take place in different ways; they may be absorbed through the skin or might be ingested. They can also affect human life by accumulating in tissues/organs and cause brain, nerve, and liver damage; cancer, asthma, and hormonal disorders. As a fossil fuel, the combustion of petrochemicals contributes to polluting emissions, especially carbon dioxide, one of the most dangerous greenhouse gases. Hence, going back to using natural materials is still the most practical and safest way of coping with the demands of society.   </p><p>- I hope this can help you a lot. :)</p><p><strong>#CarryOnLearning </strong></p><br />
