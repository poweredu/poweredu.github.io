Comparing and Contrasting Similar Information from Different TypesTell whether each of the following paragraphs is taken from factual text, literary text, or persuasive text. After identifying the text type, explain why you have decided that the paragraph is an excerpt from the type of text you have chosen.Sir Walter Scott started his narrative poem with an introduction of a knight whose name is Lochinvar. He was described to be riding a very fine horse. He has no other weapon except a broadsword.1. Text Type:___________________Explanation of Choice:_______________I was in third year high school when I first read "Lochinvar" by Sir Walter Scott. At first, I did not understand it. It was quite a pressure for a fifteen-year- old girl like me to understand the words used by a poet who wrote centuries before my time. Although written in English, the words of "Lochinvar" seemed as alien to me as Nippongo perhaps.2.Text Type:_________________Explanation of Choice:________________"Lochinvar" is a fine example of a relatively short narrative poem. "Lochinvar," compared to other poems of its genre, is brief. When likened to modern-day narratives, it seems to recount only a portion of adventures of the major character. But despite its virtual speedy transition of events, the readers will still enjoy it if they will come to understand the language of Scott's time because the plot is typical of contemporary teleseryes.3.Text Type:________________Explanation of Choice:_______________Our group chose the plot "Lochinvar" for the Poem of the Week Project, which will be displayed in the English Club bulletin board for the Book Month Celebration of our school. We have made a simple plan on how to display Lochinvar in the bulletin board. First, we will cut a three-dimensional figure of a knight with an armor and a helmet out of cardboard. Then we will paint it with silver poster paint to make it appear like a "knight in shining armor." Next, we will make him a horse and a broadsword to make him appear authentic. Next to him will be Ellen dressed in her bridal gown.4.Text Type:_________________Explanation of Choice:_______________As a highlight to its weeklong celebration of the Book Month, the English Club and the Young Librarians Guild of Pateros Catholic School present a Chamber Theater Production of an upgraded story of Sir Walter Scott's "Lochinvar" which they dubbed as "Lochinvar and Ellen" on November 29 at the PCS Auditorium.5.

Comparing and Contrasting Similar Information from Different TypesTell whether each of the following paragraphs is taken from factual text, literary text, or persuasive text. After identifying the text type, explain why you have decided that the paragraph is an excerpt from the type of text you have chosen.Sir Walter Scott started his narrative poem with an introduction of a knight whose name is Lochinvar. He was described to be riding a very fine horse. He has no other weapon except a broadsword.1. Text Type:___________________Explanation of Choice:_______________I was in third year high school when I first read "Lochinvar" by Sir Walter Scott. At first, I did not understand it. It was quite a pressure for a fifteen-year- old girl like me to understand the words used by a poet who wrote centuries before my time. Although written in English, the words of "Lochinvar" seemed as alien to me as Nippongo perhaps.2.Text Type:_________________Explanation of Choice:________________"Lochinvar" is a fine example of a relatively short narrative poem. "Lochinvar," compared to other poems of its genre, is brief. When likened to modern-day narratives, it seems to recount only a portion of adventures of the major character. But despite its virtual speedy transition of events, the readers will still enjoy it if they will come to understand the language of Scott's time because the plot is typical of contemporary teleseryes.3.Text Type:________________Explanation of Choice:_______________Our group chose the plot "Lochinvar" for the Poem of the Week Project, which will be displayed in the English Club bulletin board for the Book Month Celebration of our school. We have made a simple plan on how to display Lochinvar in the bulletin board. First, we will cut a three-dimensional figure of a knight with an armor and a helmet out of cardboard. Then we will paint it with silver poster paint to make it appear like a "knight in shining armor." Next, we will make him a horse and a broadsword to make him appear authentic. Next to him will be Ellen dressed in her bridal gown.4.Text Type:_________________Explanation of Choice:_______________As a highlight to its weeklong celebration of the Book Month, the English Club and the Young Librarians Guild of Pateros Catholic School present a Chamber Theater Production of an upgraded story of Sir Walter Scott's "Lochinvar" which they dubbed as "Lochinvar and Ellen" on November 29 at the PCS Auditorium.5.
