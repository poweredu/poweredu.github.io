The introduction of formal education by the Spanish colonial government paved the way for the establishment of schools and universities, which provided Filipinos with access to knowledge and skills.</p><p></p><p>One of the most significant legacies of education during this period was the emergence of a new class of educated Filipinos, who became leaders in various fields such as politics, literature, and journalism. These individuals played a crucial role in the fight for Philippine independence and the development of a national identity.</p><p></p><p>Education also had a profound impact on the country's economy, as it provided Filipinos with the skills and knowledge necessary to participate in modern industries and businesses.

Important as a stimulus to trade was the gradual elimination of the monopoly enjoyed by the galleon to Acapulco. The last galleon arrived in Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s Manila was open to foreign merchants almost without restriction. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</p><p></p><p>The growth of commercial agriculture resulted in the appearance of a new class. Alongside the landholdings of the church and the rice estates of the pre-Spanish nobility there arose haciendas of coffee, hemp, and sugar, often the property of enterprising Chinese-Filipino mestizos. Some of the families that gained prominence in the 19th century have continued to play an important role in Philippine economics and politics.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p>The play was well cast, the entire Bliss family did a great job showing how overly dramatic and deceitful the family had become. Each actor portrayed their character accurately; there were no standouts that didn’t match the character. Each visitor in the first act seemed to be feasible as far as the possibility of a relationship was concerned. All of the family members acted genuine. There was one actor who stood out as a perfect fit for his character. Taylor Rascher played Simon Bliss and played him perfectly. Rascher’s character Simon was a young man who was dramatic and romantic so much so it was almost to the point of ridiculousness. Rascher stole the show in the first act when he was romancing with MichelleHay Fever was a comical play with a strong message. The actors throughout this play steadily used others to gain their own attention. The message this play left behind after many laughs was do not use others, plain and simple.</p><p>The space was a well-constructed thrust stage however, the stage was not raised off the ground and the seats appeared to be mobile which lead to the belief that this is an Environmental Theater. As for the layout of the stage, there was a couch and a table in center stage for the first two acts, a door to the unseen outside front of the house upstage right, there were two large double doors upstage center leading to the backyard garden, and a raised floor upstage left containing a piano, a bookcase and a door leading to the home library. Stage left there was a half spiral staircase that lead up to the second floor which had a painting and lights that extended across to stage right. The second floor also contained the bedrooms for the house but the doors were not in sight. The detail was greater than expected: the hardwood floor throughout the first floor seemed to be genuine, the actual bookcase filled with real books not stage books, and the extremely large double doors with translucent glass and floral designs lead to the Garden, which featured an array of plants behind the doors. The entire space was well lit for the duration of the play; the stage took place inside the Bliss’ home so the bright lighting added a confortable feel to the inside of the house. The theatre was nearly sold out; it was hard to spot an empty seat, including the balcony and lower level seating. The crowd contained nearly an even amount of student audience members and senior citizens; there was few in the audience that appeared middle aged.</p><p> Luz, who plays Myra Arundel. Rascher was displaying his love for Michelle Luz (Myra) in the most dramatic of fashions; he was playing the Bliss’ game of pretending to be in complete love with someone and then a moment later change his mind. Rascher was proclaiming his love with elegant speeches and coddling up next to her and eventually kissing her. Rascher made this scene particularly hilarious because he was completely over the top in typical Bliss fashion. Of course, all of this was for naught because Luz ended up kissing Joe Hubbard’s character David Bliss in act two and also Rascher proclaimed his engagement to Caitlin Stagemoller’s character, Jackie Coryton. Rascher made his voice more shrill and audible to appear to be more dramatic and create more attention for himself. In the same way, Rascher used grander gestures with his arms (flailing, waving, etc.) to cause a more dramatic effect.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>The Filipinos in the 19th century had suffered from feudalistic and master slave relationship by the Spaniards. Their social structure is ranked into three groups:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Highest class – the people that belong in this class include the Spaniards, peninsulares and the friars. They have the power and authority to rule over the Filipinos. They enjoyed their positions and do what they want.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Middle Class – the people that belongs into this class includes the natives, mestizos and the criollos.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>→ Natives – the pure Filipinos
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>→The Mestizos are the Filipinos of mixed indigenous Filipino or European or Chinese ancestry.

</strong></p><p><strong>→The Indios are the poor people having pure blood Filipin which ruled by the Spaniards.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>By the late 19tj century, political and economic changes in Europe were finally beginning to affect Spain and, thus, the Philippines. The limited higher education in the colony was entirely under clerical direction, but by the 1880s many sons of the wealthy were sent to Europe to study.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The Philippines was at the time a Spanish colony. In the year 1800 the Philippines had been under Spanish colonisation and influence for 235 years. Yet by this point, the Philippines was getting "wiser and wiser". Certain Filipinos, possibly inspired by the French Revolution (1789), the independence of other Spanish colonies, were becoming more enlightened to the idea of independence. And indeed, these thinkings culminated in the Philippine Revolution and Declaration of Independence. Spain lost the Philippine revolution yet instead of granting us independence, the US had to step in. The US received the Philippines, for $20,000,000. Some Filipinos probably thought they had been saved by the Americans, but in the same manner as the US does now, they simply changed administration, colonial overlord. The Spanish control of the Philippines ended in the 19th century after 333 years, due to a combination of nationalism, inspiration from the Liberal egalitarian ideals of the French Revolution, as well as weakening hold and control over the Philippines. </p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>During the Spanish colonial period in the Philippines (1521–1898), the different cultures of the archipelago experienced a gradual unification from a variety of native Asian and Islamic customs and traditions, including animist religious practices, to what is known today as Filipino culture, a unique hybrid of Southeast Asian and Western culture, namely Spanish, including the Spanish language and the Catholic faith.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Library of the University of Santo Tomás in Manila, 1887. Created at the request of Archbishop Miguel de Benavides, O.P. of Manila in 1610, it is the oldest existing university in Asia. The library is also the oldest in the continent. It even had its own printing press which was brought from Europe.</p><p>Spanish education played a major role in that transformation. The oldest universities, colleges, and vocational schools, dating as far back as the late 16th century were created during the colonial period, as well as the first modern public education system in Asia, established in 1863. By the time Spain was replaced by the United States as the colonial power, Filipinos were among the most educated peoples in all of Asia, boasting one of the highest literacy rates in that continent. Simultaneously, the knowledge of Filipinos about neighboring cultures receded</p><br />
