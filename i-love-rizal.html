                                            I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war?

                            11. I Am a FilipinoI am a poet and a dreamer. In good times and in bad, I persevere with open arms and an open heart. I constantly pray for peace and I am willing to risk my life for freedom and justice. I would like to shout to the world “I am the hope of our fatherland.” These words should come from my heart — a heart of a Filipino who truly loves his country. My love for my country is not proven through mere words but through my actions as well. Some of our national heroes have written poems and essays also entitled “I am a Filipino.” They have contributed to our country’s progress at one point in time. Jose Rizal’s fight for justice would never be forgotten even after he was killed by the Spaniards. Apolinario Mabini’s literary piece made him “The Great Paralytic.” Ramon Magsaysay was motivated by Mabini to serve his countrymen well. Our fate depends not only on the leaders of our country but also on our countrymen. Each one of us has a role to play in helping our country. I am a true Filipino. What does this mean to our youth? What does this mean to you?Let’s Try This.1-2. What is the essay about? 3-4. What did the writer mean by putting words into action based on the poems and essays written by our national heroes in the past? 5-6. How can you prove your love for your country in times of war? In times of peace? 7-10.

                        <p>1. <strong>REACTION </strong>-It is wonderful to hear that the person expressing this sentiment feels a strong connection to their Filipino heritage and culture. The "Bahay Kubo" is a traditional Filipino house that is often associated with the country's rural areas, and it is great to see that it continues to evoke positive emotions and memories among Filipinos. It is important to acknowledge and appreciate one's cultural roots and history, and it seems like this person has a deep appreciation for their Filipino identity.</p><p></p><p></p><p>2. The idea that certain foods or cultural practices should be exclusive to a particular group of people is not uncommon, and it often stems from a desire to preserve cultural identity and traditions. However, it's important to note that food, like other aspects of culture, can also be shared and enjoyed by people from different backgrounds.</p><p></p><p>While it's true that bibingka is a traditional Filipino rice cake and is deeply rooted in Filipino culture and cuisine, it doesn't mean that it should be off-limits to non-Filipinos. In fact, sharing food and cultural practices can promote cultural exchange and understanding, which can help foster greater appreciation and respect for different cultures.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the decision of whether or not to share bibingka with non-Filipinos is up to the individual or community, but it's worth considering the potential benefits of sharing cultural experiences and traditions with others.</p><p></p><p>3. Reading stories from different cultures can broaden our understanding of the world and enhance our empathy towards others. At the same time, it's also essential to appreciate and celebrate the stories that come from our own culture, as they provide insight into our history, values, and identity as a people. "Noli Me Tangere" is a significant piece of Philippine literature that sheds light on the country's colonial past and continues to inspire and educate readers up to this day.</p><p></p><p></p><p>4. Based on my knowledge, "Halo-halo" is a popular Filipino dessert that is made of shaved ice, evaporated milk, various sweet beans, fruits, and other toppings. It is a refreshing and satisfying treat that can help alleviate the feeling of heat during hot weather.</p><p></p><p>5.playing "Tumbang Preso" or "Tumba Lata" during our childhood. It is a popular game in the Philippines, and it involves throwing a slipper or a stone to knock down a can or a bottle, which can be challenging and fun at the same time. It's great to hear that we enjoyed playing this game and that it holds a special place in our heart.</p><br />
