                                            An advantage paper bags have over plastic ones is the fact that paper is produced from a renewable source: trees. On the other hand, plastics are processed from depleting resources such as fossil fuels and crude oil (Ross &amp; Evans, 2002). What is commonly known though is that plastic bags are actually manufactured from the by-product of refining crude oil, allowing for the optimization of the source, and is furthermore beneficial because the excess gases from the refining process is consumed rather than simply thrown into the environment (Cadman, Evans, Holland, &amp; Boyd, 2005), but this does not alter the fact that renewable sources are more sustainable compared to non-renewable ones. These depleting resources are very limited and are more likely to be consumed faster, especially because they have numerous other functions including acting as fuel for cars. But then, although paper bags are manufactured from renewable resources, the process of cutting down trees destroys planta and animals (Muthu, Li, Hu, &amp; Mok 2010). The cutting down of trees means the reduction of carbon dioxide absorbers, and processing these trees as arw material contribute to the emission of carbon dioxide.Studies commonly use the life cycle analysis methodology is assessing the environmental impacts of both bags. Life cycle analysis is an evaluation tool that comprises of four aspects namely: goal and definition, inventory analysis, impact analysis, and interpretation (Sevitz, Brent, &amp; Fourie, 2003). Most studies analyze the life cycle bags form its production to its disposal or the so-called “cradle-to-grave” analysis. Muthu, Li, Hu, and Mok (2010) concluded in their study that the disposal of these bags make a difference on how much impact a bag has on the environment. The results of their study showed that reusing a bag allows its maximization and allows for it to be used until the end of its life cycle. Reusing bags at least four times “give the greatest environmental impacts of types of carrier bags” (Bell &amp; Cave, 2011).Guide Questions:1. What are the main claims presented in the paragraphs?2. How these supported?3. What evidences are used to support these claims?

                                            If ever you come across in either business or consumer loans, give your thoughts on the following statements showing how to manage loans effectively (Security Bank Team). 1. Borrow for the right reasons.  2. Borrow only for what you need.  3. Know how much you can afford to pay.  4. Choose the right loan facility.  5. Monitor your cash flow, specially your spending. ​ANSWERBorrow for the right reasons.When you borrow money, you should use it to buy an asset that increases value over time and has a potential to make your money — this is what he calls the good debt.Borrow only what you need.If you need P200,000 to start a business, then borrow only that amount, even if you’re eligible for a loan with a higher amount.Remember that the bigger the amount you borrow, then the more interests fees you pay, the larger your monthly payments are, and the longer you most likely have to pay.Know how much you can afford to pay.Check your budget and see how much you can actually afford to pay every month. According to him, you should never assume you’ll have more money in the future, and just work within your current income.Choose the right loan facility.Banks and most financial institutions can definitely offer much lower rates. And when it comes to borrowing money, getting the lowest interest rate should be your priority.Monitor your cashflow, especially your spending.After getting the money, keeping track of your spending should now be your priority. Be sure that you’re not splurging your borrowed cash on unnecessary or unplanned purchases. Another thing, make sure to always pay on time to avoid extra charges.</a>

4. There are different degrees of friendship. Some friends are casual; you may share a couple of interests with them, and you may talk sometimes, but you're not as deep as you could be, and that's just how the friendship is. Other friends you're more close to. You spend time whenever you can, and you've been through it all. You may have had a childhood with them and have experienced ups and downs, and yet they're still good friends of yours. The two of you can go for a long time without talking, but once you start talking again, it's like no time has passed. The relationship just feels secure. Then there is the social media definition of a friend, in which the two of you have your accounts linked together on social media, but maybe you don't actually talk at all. You should not confuse social media 'friends' with real-life friends.

5. What is the difference between a friend and an acquaintance? An acquaintance is a person who you talk to on occasion, but the friendship bond is just not there. Maybe it would be there if the two of you talked more, but odds are, the person is someone who is nice and good to talk to on occasion, but it just doesn’t feel as though there’s a bond. They likely won't be the person you talk to when problems are happening. They aren't going to be the person you see yourself spending a lot of time with. Alternatively, some friendships blossom from acquaintanceships, if we only give them a chance. Look at your social media, as well as the people you know in real life. How many of them would you say are friends? How many are just acquaintances? Perhaps the biggest problem with friendship today is mixing the two up. Odds are, only a handful of people in your life are worthy to be your friend, while the others are actually acquaintances.

                                            TRUE OR FALSE 
1. Remember to adjust your volume to the size of the audience and the venue. When addressing a large audience, modulate your voice in such a way that you speak loudly without sounding like shouting or yelling
2. Vary your rate and speed to keep your audience interested and to avoid a monotone pattern. the audience might get bored if you if you speak very slowly and they might get confused if you speak very fast. Hence, your rate should be at an appropriate speed.
3. Master your voice and find your pitch (high or low). if you have a high pitch level, modulate or slightly move it down. if you have a low pitch level, modulate or slightly move it up. your performance will definitely be affected if you do not modulate.
4. Use a pauses when you emphasize the most important words, phrases, or sentences. Your pauses should not last for three seconds. Otherwise, it will result in dead air or a moment of a awkward silence.
5. Pronounce and enunciate words correctly. You will confuse the audience if you mispronounce words, and it could distract them and affect your credibility.
6. Avoid fillers or expressions that substitute actual words in your speech because these words are distracting. Examples of filler are "like", "um", "ah", "uh" and "er". To reduce the use of these fillers, detect the instances when you use them; Do you generally use fillers after each sentence, between different ideas, or whenever you make transition? then, instead of using them the next time you deliver a speech, simply stop and pause
7. Pronunciation makes your speech interesting to listen to listen to and it is what makes the words and phrases stand out.</a>

                                            A friend is a person other than your family or partner that you share close affection with. You share kindness, sympathy, empathy, compassion, loyalty, fun, and probably some common beliefs and values with them. They can be in person or online, your next door neighbor or 1,000 miles away.
There are different degrees of friendship. Some friends are casual; you may share a couple of interests with them, and you may talk sometimes, but you're not as deep as you could be, and that's just how the friendship is. Other friends you're more close to. You spend time whenever you can, and you've been through it all. You may have had a childhood with them and have experienced ups and downs, and yet they're still good friends of yours. The two of you can go for a long time without talking, but once you start talking again, it's like no time has passed. The relationship just feels secure.

                            7. An advantage paper bags have over plastic ones is the fact that paper is produced from a renewable source: trees. On the other hand, plastics are processed from depleting resources such as fossil fuels and crude oil (Ross &amp; Evans, 2002). What is commonly known though is that plastic bags are actually manufactured from the by-product of refining crude oil, allowing for the optimization of the source, and is furthermore beneficial because the excess gases from the refining process is consumed rather than simply thrown into the environment (Cadman, Evans, Holland, &amp; Boyd, 2005), but this does not alter the fact that renewable sources are more sustainable compared to non-renewable ones. These depleting resources are very limited and are more likely to be consumed faster, especially because they have numerous other functions including acting as fuel for cars. But then, although paper bags are manufactured from renewable resources, the process of cutting down trees destroys planta and animals (Muthu, Li, Hu, &amp; Mok 2010). The cutting down of trees means the reduction of carbon dioxide absorbers, and processing these trees as arw material contribute to the emission of carbon dioxide.Studies commonly use the life cycle analysis methodology is assessing the environmental impacts of both bags. Life cycle analysis is an evaluation tool that comprises of four aspects namely: goal and definition, inventory analysis, impact analysis, and interpretation (Sevitz, Brent, &amp; Fourie, 2003). Most studies analyze the life cycle bags form its production to its disposal or the so-called “cradle-to-grave” analysis. Muthu, Li, Hu, and Mok (2010) concluded in their study that the disposal of these bags make a difference on how much impact a bag has on the environment. The results of their study showed that reusing a bag allows its maximization and allows for it to be used until the end of its life cycle. Reusing bags at least four times “give the greatest environmental impacts of types of carrier bags” (Bell &amp; Cave, 2011).Guide Questions:1. What are the main claims presented in the paragraphs?2.

Monitor your cash flow, specially your spending. ​ANSWERBorrow for the right reasons.When you borrow money, you should use it to buy an asset that increases value over time and has a potential to make your money — this is what he calls the good debt.Borrow only what you need.If you need P200,000 to start a business, then borrow only that amount, even if you’re eligible for a loan with a higher amount.Remember that the bigger the amount you borrow, then the more interests fees you pay, the larger your monthly payments are, and the longer you most likely have to pay.Know how much you can afford to pay.Check your budget and see how much you can actually afford to pay every month. According to him, you should never assume you’ll have more money in the future, and just work within your current income.Choose the right loan facility.Banks and most financial institutions can definitely offer much lower rates. And when it comes to borrowing money, getting the lowest interest rate should be your priority.Monitor your cashflow, especially your spending.After getting the money, keeping track of your spending should now be your priority. Be sure that you’re not splurging your borrowed cash on unnecessary or unplanned purchases. Another thing, make sure to always pay on time to avoid extra charges.</h2><br />

The two of you can go for a long time without talking, but once you start talking again, it's like no time has passed. The relationship just feels secure. Then there is the social media definition of a friend, in which the two of you have your accounts linked together on social media, but maybe you don't actually talk at all. You should not confuse social media 'friends' with real-life friends.

5. What is the difference between a friend and an acquaintance? An acquaintance is a person who you talk to on occasion, but the friendship bond is just not there. Maybe it would be there if the two of you talked more, but odds are, the person is someone who is nice and good to talk to on occasion, but it just doesn’t feel as though there’s a bond. They likely won't be the person you talk to when problems are happening. They aren't going to be the person you see yourself spending a lot of time with. Alternatively, some friendships blossom from acquaintanceships, if we only give them a chance. Look at your social media, as well as the people you know in real life. How many of them would you say are friends? How many are just acquaintances? Perhaps the biggest problem with friendship today is mixing the two up. Odds are, only a handful of people in your life are worthy to be your friend, while the others are actually acquaintances.

                            17. TRUE OR FALSE 
1. Remember to adjust your volume to the size of the audience and the venue. When addressing a large audience, modulate your voice in such a way that you speak loudly without sounding like shouting or yelling
2. Vary your rate and speed to keep your audience interested and to avoid a monotone pattern. the audience might get bored if you if you speak very slowly and they might get confused if you speak very fast. Hence, your rate should be at an appropriate speed.
3. Master your voice and find your pitch (high or low). if you have a high pitch level, modulate or slightly move it down. if you have a low pitch level, modulate or slightly move it up. your performance will definitely be affected if you do not modulate.
4. Use a pauses when you emphasize the most important words, phrases, or sentences. Your pauses should not last for three seconds. Otherwise, it will result in dead air or a moment of a awkward silence.
5. Pronounce and enunciate words correctly. You will confuse the audience if you mispronounce words, and it could distract them and affect your credibility.
6. Avoid fillers or expressions that substitute actual words in your speech because these words are distracting. Examples of filler are "like", "um", "ah", "uh" and "er". To reduce the use of these fillers, detect the instances when you use them; Do you generally use fillers after each sentence, between different ideas, or whenever you make transition? then, instead of using them the next time you deliver a speech, simply stop and pause
7. Pronunciation makes your speech interesting to listen to listen to and it is what makes the words and phrases stand out.</h2><br />

                            18. Read the given paragraph below: differences between tokyo and kyoto in recent decades, the title of one of the most popular cultures worldwide should be definitely given to japan. millions of people all over the world study the japanese language, watch dorama (dramatic tv series on all kinds of topics) or animation, read and write haiku, and make pen pals with japanese people. countless people buy tickets and fly to the country of the rising sun to see its wonders with their own eyes. among the most popular destinations—mostly because these city names are most known to the western public—are tokyo and kyoto. and perhaps for an inexperienced traveler, there is a dilemma: where to go? mostly, people know that tokyo is a mega city of the future, and kyoto has more to do with ancient culture, traditions, and so on. basically it is true, but at the same time, there also exist more subtle differences one should consider when choosing their destination point in japan. the first of them is prices. tokyo is expensive—as you might expect from the capital of the most urbanized country in the world (the prices below are listed in japanese yen: 1 usd approximately equals 100 yen). so, to grab some inexpensive snack in tokyo would cost around 850 yen. having a three-course meal for two people in a mid-range restaurant, in case you travel with your spouse, will cost you 5,230 yen. a one-way ticket on tokyo transport costs you 190 yen, and renting one room apartment outside of the city center costs 77,853 yen (and this is probably a weekly price). just do not expect this apartment to be big and cozy; most likely it will be tiny, with basic utilities, and with no central heating (actually, there is no such thing in japan at all—everyone warms their house up on their own). if you think of buying an apartment in tokyo, forget it—one square meter of a room outside of the city center is around 1 million yen (double the price if you want to live closer to the city center). kyoto is not much cheaper. although dining in a restauran</h2><br />

                            26. A friend is a person other than your family or partner that you share close affection with. You share kindness, sympathy, empathy, compassion, loyalty, fun, and probably some common beliefs and values with them. They can be in person or online, your next door neighbor or 1,000 miles away.
There are different degrees of friendship. Some friends are casual; you may share a couple of interests with them, and you may talk sometimes, but you're not as deep as you could be, and that's just how the friendship is. Other friends you're more close to. You spend time whenever you can, and you've been through it all. You may have had a childhood with them and have experienced ups and downs, and yet they're still good friends of yours. The two of you can go for a long time without talking, but once you start talking again, it's like no time has passed. The relationship just feels secure.

Then there is the social media definition of a friend, in which the two of you have your accounts linked together on social media, but maybe you don't actually talk at all. You should not confuse social media 'friends' with real-life friends.
