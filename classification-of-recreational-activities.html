                        BE HAPPIER - FEEL GREAT!
<p><strong>Practiced in clinical, residential and community settings, the profession of therapeutic recreation uses treatment, education, and recreation services to help people with illnesses, disabilities and other conditions to develop and use their leisure to enhance their health, independence and well being.
</strong></p><p><strong>Outdoor adventure activities for people with limited physical ability give participants feelings of success and improved feelings of confidence.  </strong></p><p><strong>There is no greater opportunity for people to experience self-actualization and the spiritual renewal, creative expression, discovery and stimulation than leisure offers.</strong>
</p><p>
</p>BUILD FAMILY UNITY
<p><strong>Family bonds are improved by the sharing of leisure time. Families that recreate together tend to be closer, more cohesive and improve their chances of staying together. This is true with both parent-child relationships and married couples.  Families are the cornerstone in promoting well-being and healthy development in children.</strong>
</p><p>
</p>TAKE CARE OF LATCH KEY CHILDREN - EDUCATE CHILDREN AND ADULTS - PROVIDE CHILD CARE
<p><strong>Recent studies show disturbing trends about children who regularly come home to an empty house: higher than average drop out rate, drug abuse, truancy and depression.
</strong></p><p><strong>Good news for working parents! Many communities' parks and recreation agencies provide after school and summer child care.
</strong></p><p><strong>In Fort Myers, Florida, 80% of the adolescents who enrolled and participated in the STARS (Success Through Academics and Recreational Support) program improved their grades.</strong>
</p><p>
</p>CONTROL WEIGHT, LOOK BETTER, BUILD STRONG BODIES
<p><strong>Sports participants had significantly lower body mass index values, lower blood pressures, and lower resting pulse rates.
</strong></p><p><strong>The physically fit person is less prone to injury, and is less likely to experience depression.</strong>
</p><p>
</p>DIMINISH CHANCE OF DISEASE - DECREASE INSURANCE PREMIUMS - LIVE LONGER!
<p><strong>Childhood participation in organized fitness and sports programs helps attain higher bone density establishing a strong health base to combat osteoporosis in later life.
</strong></p><p><strong>An estimated 66,000 U.S. deaths from coronary heart disease, colon cancer and diabetes could be prevented annually if one half of the sedentary people became active on a regular basis.</strong>
</p><p>
</p>BUILD SELF-ESTEEM
<p><strong>When young people feel good about themselves they operate more effectively and productively in our communities, families and schools. Adventure programs teach the importance of trust, appropriate risk taking, supportive social interaction and personal challenge while creating valuable life long memories.
</strong></p><p><strong>Leaders are trained, developed and nurtured through leisure organizations such as teen clubs, camps and programs.</strong>
