                        <p><strong>→ You can see the table in the picture below.</strong></p>Further explanation:What kinds of plate tectonic borders are there?<p><strong>Divergent, convergent, and transform</strong> plate boundaries are the three different types of plate tectonic boundaries. <strong>Tectonic plates</strong> are a collection of parts that make up the lithosphere of the Earth, which is made up of the crust and upper mantle.</p><p></p><p>When two tectonic plates diverge, a <strong>diverging border</strong> is created. As magma (molten rock) rises from the Earth's mantle to the surface and solidifies to form a new oceanic crust, earthquakes frequently occur along these borders. Divergent plate boundaries can be seen, for instance, in the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.</p><p></p><p>An area where two plates converge is referred to as a <strong>convergent border</strong>. The borders of one or both colliding plates may bow up into mountain ranges as a result of the impact, or one plate may bend down into a deep undersea trench. Along convergent plate borders, a chain of volcanoes frequently arises and strong earthquakes frequently occur. As an illustration of a convergent plate boundary, consider the Pacific Ring of Fire.</p><p></p><p>The oceanic crust is frequently pushed into the mantle near convergent plate borders, where it starts to melt. Granite, the rock that forms the continents, is created when magma rises into and through the other plate. Therefore, at convergent boundaries, oceanic and continental crusts are annihilated.</p><p></p><p>A <strong>transform plate</strong> boundary is created by two plates moving past one another. The San Andreas Fault zone, which spans under the ocean, is home to one of the most well-known transform plate borders. Structures, whether created by nature or by humans, that cross a transform boundary are offset; they are cut into pieces and moved in opposing directions. As the plates move apart, the rocks that line the boundary are crushed, forming a fault valley or submarine canyon. These faults are prone to earthquakes. At transform margins, crust is fractured and broken rather than formed or destroyed, in contrast to convergent and divergent boundaries.</p><p></p><p><strong>Learn more about tectonics here: </strong>https://brainly.ph/question/2779945#the </p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />
