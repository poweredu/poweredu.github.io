                                            please answer this..title - ChangesBy Rachael C CastroWhen I was younger. I could still hear my father play music using theturntable And as the time goes by, nobody under eighteen years old wouldask about, well those next to it like tape recorders, compact disk or CD.Your expressions date you. For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words. I just can't imagine how a divan looks like when one of the supervisors told us to have one inside the room for our cleaning materials. I should have understood it only if she said sofa.Read a short story and answer the following questions; 1. What type of connection is used in the story you have read? 2. What are the character's traits that you can compare yourself to?3.Explain the life lessons that can be derived from the story?​</a>

Act I Romeo and Juliet begins as the Chorus introduces two feuding families of Verona: the Capulets and the Montagues. On a hot summer's day, the young men of each faction fight until the Prince of Verona intercedes and threatens to banish them. Soon after, the head of the Capulet family plans a feast. His goal is to introduce his daughter Juliet to a Count named Paris who seeks to marry Juliet. Montague's son Romeo and his friends (Benvolio and Mercutio) hear of the party and resolve to go in disguise. Romeo hopes to see his beloved Rosaline at the party. Instead, while there, he meets Juliet and falls instantly in love with her. Juliet's cousin Tybalt recognizes the Montague boys and forces them to leave just as Romeo and Juliet discover one another. Act II Romeo lingers near the Capulet house to talk with Juliet when she appears in her window. The pair declare their love for one another and intend to marry the next day. With the help of Juliet's Nurse, the lovers arrange to marry when Juliet goes for confession at the cell of Friar Laurence. There, they are secretly married (talk about a short engagement). Task 2.

One in which you will be colliding with other molecules.  As you move through the membrane be ready for many jolts.  I did want to give you a description of the membrane.  The membrane is made of two types of molecules.  The first is the phospholipids.  These are made of long chains of fatty acids and phosphates.  The phosphate sections like the water or are attracted to the water and appear on the outside  and inside of the cell.  The legs or long molecules of the phospholipids are the lipids or long chains of carbon with hydrogen.  These molecules form two layers of the bi-phospholipid membrane.  A picture of this membrane would be like many people laying side by side and feet to feet.  Their heads would be the phosphate section and their legs would be the fats.  Since the fats are hydrophobic they are attracted to each other.  The other part of the membrane is the proteins.  The proteins are much larger than the phospholipid bi-layer.  They actually stick out from each side of the membrane.  They are very active in moving molecules across the membrane. Now we will need to move across this membrane.  As we move across I would like to point out the smaller water molecules moving through diffusion through the membrane.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>Sana po makatulong. </p><p></p><p>#CarryOnLearning</p><p>#StudyHard</p><p>#MarkBrainliest</p><p>#FollowMe</p><br />

For example. I am from the group before Martial Law, the time when Filipino pop music was very popular!My father's music pushed me to collect some old-fashioned terms. Telephones now became handy and called cell phones, iceboxes then became refrigerators, now are food-storage systems, the audio system then now a home entertainment center About food, macaroni, noodles, and spaghetti are terms used by the oldies. These are now called pasta.Back then, a camera needed rolls of film for snapshots, while now you can have as many poses as you want plus your selfie. Buy your film in a shopping center now called the mall and have your picture developed by a printing machine which now can be just inside your home beside your laptop a printerPeers instead of pals and role models for heroes. Detention centers for jails and wetland is used to be ecologically correct swamp. Siblings for brothers and sisters, parameters for boundaries, finances for money.Well maybe this is as it should be: marking the time or era or generation with words.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Proteins destined to be secreted move through the secretory pathway in the following order: rough ER → ER-to-Golgi transport vesicles → Golgi cisternae → secretory or transport vesicles → cell surface (exocytosis) (see Figure 17-13). Small transport vesicles bud off from the ER and fuse to form the cis-Golgi reticulum.</p><br />
