                        <p><strong>Rizal was exiled in Dapitan</strong> because like nearby Dipolog it was a Jesuit mission. It was hoped that the Jesuits could convince this Ateneo alumnus to turn away from his subversive and separatist ideas as well as his “shipwreck of Faith.”</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>JOSE RIZAL’S LIFE:  EXILE, TRIAL AND DEATH         Learning Outcomes:   At the end of the lesson, the students should be able to: 1. Analyze the factors that led to Jose Rizal’s execution on Spanish colonial rule and the Philippine revolution. Class Activity: 1. Read the constitution of La Liga Filipina and fill out a table (graphic organizer) with the aims of La Liga Filipina in one column and examples of these aims could be attained in another column. 2. Read Rizal’s last letters to family members and Blumentritt. 3. Read Teodora Alonzo’s letter to Governor General Polavieja and write a similar letter persuading him to spare Rizal’s life.  2. Analyze the effects of Jose Rizal’s execution on Spanish colonial rule and the Philippine revolution. Jose Rizal’s Exile (1892-96)</p><p></p><p>  Jose dwelled as exile in Dapitan, Zamboanga Del Norte, a far-removed town in Mindanao from 1892 to 1896. This four-year interregnum in Jose’s life was summed up by Zaide and Zaide (2104) as: Tediously unexciting, but was abundantly fruitful with varied achievements. He practiced medicine, pursed scientific studies, continued his artistic and literary works, widened his knowledge of languages, established a school for boys, promoted community development projects, invented a wooden machine for making bricks, and engaged in farming and commerce. Despite his multifarious activities, fellow reformists, and eminent scientists and scholars of Europe.              In Dapitan, Jose had a very peaceful, happy, and enjoyable life and the way he lived it was extremely good and deserving to be admired and copied. He made sure his stay in Dapitan would be fruitful, so he engaged in manifold activities. His excellent skill in the science of medicine spread like wild fire in Dapitan. His medical practice attracted many patients who were mostly poor. He put to good use the</p><p></p><p>curative</p><p></p><p>values</p><p></p><p>of</p><p></p><p>the</p><p></p><p>Philippines</p><p></p><p>medicinal</p><p></p><p>plants</p><p></p><p>which</p><p></p><p>he</p><p></p><p>studied  and doled them out to his poor patients who could not afford to buy imported medicine. He welcomed both affluent and indigent patients. He normally undercharged them if not for free and accepted any payments in kind from those who had little or no money.   </p><p></p><p>With the assistance of Father Francisco Sanchez, his former Jesuit teacher, Jose buckled down to work. He enhanced the town plaza and accentuated it with a huge relief map of Mindanao, which can still be viewed today. One of the impressive projects of Jose was the water system he designed and constructed in order that people of Dapitan can have access to clean water. In spite of lack of funds, exiguous resources and no government assistance, he was able to build it, armed only with his training in Ateneo, readings of engineering books, sheer determination and ingenuity. To reduce the occurrence of malaria, he drained the marshes where mosquitos thrived. Utilizing the 500 pesos he received from an English patient, he introduced a lighting system made up of coconut oil lamps in glass protectors which lighted up dark areas in the town.    Imbued with the value of education since childhood, Jose realized his dream to establish his own school in which he applied the educational system he learned</p><p></p><p>abroad. The school opened with three pupils which increased to 16 and later to 21. His lessons constituted of reading, writing languages (Spanish and English), geography, history, mathematics (arithmetic and geometry), industrial work, study of nature, and morals. He also trained and exposed them to gymnastics, boxing, wrestling, stone-throwing, swimming, arnis (native frencing), and boating for physical development and discipline. He did not charge his pupils for sharing his knowledge, instead, he encouraged them to help him in his garden, farm, and construction projects in the community.</p><p></p><p>Jose conducted scientific studies in the rich virgin field if Dapitan and collected specimens of animals and plants. He forwarded these specimens to the Dresden museum of Europe and he received scientific books and surgical instruments as payment. He has an impressive assemblage of his study of 346 shells from 203 species. He obtained knowledge on some rare specimens which were named in his honor by European scientists such as Draco rizali (a flying dragon), Apogonia rizali (a small beetle), </p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>hope its help<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Who Was José Rizal?</p><p>While living in Europe, José Rizal wrote about the discrimination that accompanied Spain's colonial rule of his country. He returned to the Philippines in 1892 but was exiled due to his desire for reform. Although he supported peaceful change, Rizal was convicted of sedition and executed on December 30, 1896, at age 35.</p><p></p><p>Early Life</p><p>On June 19, 1861, José Protasio Rizal Mercado y Alonso Realonda was born in Calamba in the Philippines' Laguna Province. A brilliant student who became proficient in multiple languages, José Rizal studied medicine in Manila. In 1882, he traveled to Spain to complete his medical degree.</p><p></p><p>Writing and Reform</p><p>While in Europe, José Rizal became part of the Propaganda Movement, connecting with other Filipinos who wanted reform. He also wrote his first novel, Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not/The Social Cancer), a work that detailed the dark aspects of Spain's colonial rule in the Philippines, with particular focus on the role of Catholic friars. The book was banned in the Philippines, though copies were smuggled in. Because of this novel, Rizal's return to the Philippines in 1887 was cut short when he was targeted by police.</p><p></p><p>Rizal returned to Europe and continued to write, releasing his follow-up novel, El Filibusterismo (The Reign of Greed) in 1891. He also published articles in La Solidaridad, a paper aligned with the Propaganda Movement. The reforms Rizal advocated for did not include independence—he called for equal treatment of Filipinos, limiting the power of Spanish friars and representation for the Philippines in the Spanish Cortes (Spain's parliament).</p><p></p><p>Exile in the Philippines</p><p>Rizal returned to the Philippines in 1892, feeling he needed to be in the country to effect change. Although the reform society he founded, the Liga Filipino (Philippine League), supported non-violent action, Rizal was still exiled to Dapitan, on the island of Mindanao. During the four years Rizal was in exile, he practiced medicine and took on students.</p><p></p><p>Execution and Legacy</p><p>In 1895, Rizal asked for permission to travel to Cuba as an army doctor. His request was approved, but in August 1896, Katipunan, a nationalist Filipino society founded by Andres Bonifacio, revolted. Though he had no ties to the group and disapproved of its violent methods, Rizal was arrested shortly thereafter.</p><p></p><p>After a show trial, Rizal was convicted of sedition and sentenced to death by firing squad. Rizal's public execution was carried out in Manila on December 30, 1896, when he was 35 years old. His execution created more opposition to Spanish rule.</p><p></p><p>Spain's control of the Philippines ended in 1898, though the country did not gain lasting independence until after World War II. Rizal remains a nationalist icon in the Philippines for helping the country take its first steps toward independence.</p><br />

                            29. Describe and explain why Jose Rizal was exiled in Dapitan and how did he live his life in Dapitan​</h2><br />
                        Jose Rizal was detained by Spanish authorities for the following reasons:for disseminating anti-Catholic and anti-friar literature;for possessing the Pobres Frailes, a collection of handbills that contained arguments against Spanish orders;for highlighting on the title page of his book El Filibusterismo that "the only salvation for the Philippines was secession from the mother country (referring to Spain)" and dedicated it to the three "traitors" Gomez, Burgos, and Zamora.for merely decrying the religion and attempting to get it eliminated from Filipino society.<p></p> Arrival in DapitanQuestioning Religion<p>Father Pablo Pastells and Rizal engaged in a scholastic discussion about religion in Dapitan. This violent debate exposed Rizal's anti-Christian views and his resentment of the friars' injustices committed in the guise of the sacred religion. Fortunately or sadly, Father Pastells' efforts to convert Rizal to the faith were fruitless. These discussions came to a deadlock because neither party was able to persuade the other of his conclusions or arguments.</p><p></p>Employment and Contributions<p>Rizal made the most of his time in Dapitan by spending a lot of energy on developing his literary and creative abilities, working on community and agricultural initiatives, conducting business, and writing letters to his friends in Europe, especially Ferdinand Blumentritt and Reinhold Rost. He had the following occupations and accomplishments across many industries:</p>As a <strong>doctor</strong>, Rizal gave his patients—the majority of whom were underprivileged—free medicine.As an <strong>engineer</strong>, Rizal put his skills to use by building a water system in Dapitan.As a <strong>schoolteacher</strong>, Rizal built a school in Dapitan which was attended by 16 young boys from important families.In his 16 hectares of property, Rizal spent time <strong>cultivating </strong>significant crops and establishing fruit-bearing trees (later, reaching as large as 70 hectares).The intrepid Rizal tried his hand as a <strong>businessman </strong>in the fishing, hemp, and copra businesses with his partner Ramon Carreon.Rizal was a little-known <strong>inventor</strong>. He created the sulpukan, a unique form of lighter while working as a doctor in Calamba in 1887, and he gave it to Blumentritt as a gift.He had shared his <strong>artistic </strong>abilities with the Sisters of Charity as they got ready for the Holy Virgin's arrival.Rizal studied and compared the Malayan and Bisayan <strong>languages </strong>that are spoken in the area because he was interested in the languages spoken in Dapitan.Rizal introduced his students to his fascination with nature as a scientist. Rizal's <strong>discovery </strong>of three species was his most significant contribution to science:Draco rizali – flying dragonApogonia rizali – small beetleRhacophorus rizali – rare frogRizal participates in<strong> civic activities</strong> in Dapitan. In order to get rid of mosquitoes that spread malaria, he drained the marshes in Dapitan. Additionally, he installed coconut oil lights in the gloomy alleys as a lighting system.<p></p><p><strong>Learn more about Jose Rizal in Dapitan here: https://brainly.ph/question/2072575</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ5</p><br />
