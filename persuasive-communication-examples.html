Interactive model supports the idea that there is a never-ending process of communication and feedback when communicators exchange messages in a role-switching manner.</p>​Let’s sum it up!<strong>Communication models</strong> explain the communication process, illustrate the relationships between variables, and assist in identifying and resolving communication issues.The three common models of communication are linear, transactional, and interactive.The linear model is a unidirectional, <strong>one-way </strong>communication process that emphasizes persuasion over mutual understanding and places a higher importance on psychological than social impacts.In the transactional model, the communicators—<strong>the sender</strong> and <strong>the receiver</strong>—take turns exchanging information.Frank Dance created the Helical Model, which highlights how communication changes over time from the beginning to the present. It depends on the past and is concerned with the idea of time.According to the transactional communication model, communication is a result of our <strong>learning</strong>.According to Wilbur Schramm,<strong> man's range of experience</strong> has an impact on communication since the sender and receiver can communicate because they have shared experiences.<p></p><p><strong>Learn more about the Shannon-Weaver model here: https://brainly.ph/question/3737154#</strong></p><p></p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

                        <p></p>"TV Show Comparison"<p></p><p>I've watched both "The Umbrella Academy" and "Sense 8" during the community quarantine, and both shows have some similarities, differences, and unique features that make them worth watching.</p><p></p><p>In terms of similarities, both shows have a diverse cast of characters with unique abilities and backgrounds. They both have complex storylines that involve time travel, parallel universes, and secret organizations with questionable agendas. Moreover, both shows explore themes of family, love, and friendship, and they both have impressive visuals and cinematography.</p><p></p><p>However, there are also some significant differences between the two shows. "The Umbrella Academy" is more focused on action and adventure, with fast-paced fight scenes and intense moments that keep the viewers on edge. On the other hand, "Sense 8" is more focused on drama and relationships, with slower-paced scenes that allow the viewers to get to know the characters and their struggles.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, "Sense 8" features a more global setting, with characters from different parts of the world coming together to fight a common enemy. In contrast, "The Umbrella Academy" takes place in a more localized setting, with most of the action taking place in a single city.</p><p></p><p>Overall, while both shows are excellent in their own way, "Sense 8" is a better show in terms of character development, emotional depth, and representation of diverse cultures. The show features a powerful and diverse cast, with characters that represent different races, genders, and sexualities, all working together to fight for a common goal. The show also deals with important social issues, such as LGBTQ+ rights, political corruption, and police brutality, in a nuanced and compelling way.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, while "The Umbrella Academy" has some compelling characters and exciting action scenes, the show can be a bit shallow at times, with some characters feeling underdeveloped and some storylines feeling rushed or underwhelming. The show's setting and plot can also feel a bit formulaic at times, with some elements feeling like they've been borrowed from other superhero shows.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, while both "The Umbrella Academy" and "Sense 8" are worth watching, "Sense 8" is a better show in terms of character development, emotional depth, and representation of diverse cultures. The show's global setting, nuanced social commentary, and powerful performances make it a must-watch for anyone looking for a thought-provoking and engaging TV series.</p><br />
