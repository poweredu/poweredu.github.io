My guides moved back. I stood alone,As the current streaked over smooth flat stone.Shelf by stone shelf the river fell.The white water goosetailed with eddying swell.   Faster and louder the current droppedTill it reached a cliff, and the trail stopped.I stood at the edge where the mist ascended,   My journey done where the world ended.I looked downstream. There was nothing but sky,   The sound of the water, and the water’s reply.   ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The song seems to be promoting the idea of racial unity and the importance of music as a means of bringing people together. However, it may be argued that the song still perpetuates the idea of racial categories, referring to the singer and the listener as "white" and "not white." While the intention of the song may be positive, the use of these categories could be seen as perpetuating racial divisions. Additionally, the idea that "there's no such tune as a black tune" or "a white tune" could be interpreted as downplaying or ignoring the significant contributions of different musical genres and cultures.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There does not seem to be any apparent bias or prejudice in this song. On the contrary, it conveys a message of unity and togetherness, irrespective of race or color. The song emphasizes the fact that music is a universal language that transcends racial and cultural barriers. It suggests that people can work together and learn from each other's differences and that there is a common ground where everyone can come together and celebrate their diversity. Therefore, this song promotes inclusivity and harmony.</p><br />

We're going,” they said, “to the end of the world.”   So they stopped the car where the river curled,   And we scrambled down beneath the bridge   On the gravel track of a narrow ridge.We tramped for miles on a wooded walkWhere dog-hobble grew on its twisted stalk.Then we stopped to rest on the pine-needle floor   While two ospreys watched from an oak by the shore.We came to a bend, where the river grew wide   And green mountains rose on the opposite side.   My guides moved back. I stood alone,As the current streaked over smooth flat stone.Shelf by stone shelf the river fell.The white water goosetailed with eddying swell.   Faster and louder the current droppedTill it reached a cliff, and the trail stopped.I stood at the edge where the mist ascended,   My journey done where the world ended.I looked downstream. There was nothing but sky,   The sound of the water, and the water’s reply.   ​</h2><br />
