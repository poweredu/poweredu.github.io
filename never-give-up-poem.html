                                            When everything's darkness
And you feel so alone,
When the rain doesn't stop
And you can't make it home,
When it feels all is lost
And you just want to run,
It can't rain forever.
Just wait for the sun.
When family is pain,
When friends can't be found,
When you just want to scream
But you can't find the sound,
When it's all your fault,
And you feel like you're done,
Just wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
The storm always passes.
It won't last forever.
The rain always stops and gives way to good weather.
The brightest and warmest of days still to come.
Please wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
People who need you,
People who still love you
Can warm up your soul like the sunshine above you.
You're never alone,
No matter what's done.
Wait for the sun.
Just wait for the sun.
Dark clouds always pass.
I promise you, hun.
We're all waiting with you.
Just wait for the sun.

                            8. When everything's darkness
And you feel so alone,
When the rain doesn't stop
And you can't make it home,
When it feels all is lost
And you just want to run,
It can't rain forever.
Just wait for the sun.
When family is pain,
When friends can't be found,
When you just want to scream
But you can't find the sound,
When it's all your fault,
And you feel like you're done,
Just wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
The storm always passes.
It won't last forever.
The rain always stops and gives way to good weather.
The brightest and warmest of days still to come.
Please wait for the sun.
The sunshine will come.
People who need you,
People who still love you
Can warm up your soul like the sunshine above you.
You're never alone,
No matter what's done.
Wait for the sun.
Just wait for the sun.
Dark clouds always pass.
I promise you, hun.
We're all waiting with you.
Just wait for the sun.

As you hoped
It would be,
You still could say
"I gave today
All that I had in me."
Except from the poem "Suzie Bitner" Was Afraid of the Drain by Barbara Vance at SuzieBitner.com
The stanza above tells us that :
A. There is always ups and downs in life. 
B. Don’t lose hope; you will have your turn. 
C. One must do his/her best for a good result. 
D. Whatever it takes as long as you give your best.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>D.whatever it takes as long as you give your best</p><br />
