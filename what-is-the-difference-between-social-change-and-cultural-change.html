Inequality between the genders is a phenomenon that goes back at least 4,000 years (Lerner 1986). Although the forms and ways in which it has been practiced differ between cultures and change significantly through history, its persistence has led to the formulation of the concept of patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a set of institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are dichotomous and unequal categories. Key to patriarchy is what might be called the dominant gender ideology toward sexual differences: the assumption that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability (i.e., their gender). These differences are used to justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege. The question that feminists ask therefore is: How does this distinction between male and female, and the attribution of different qualities to each, serve to organize our institutions (e.g., the family, law, the occupational structure, religious institutions, the division between public and private) and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?

1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."
"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s
family all fled to Bulacan to escape the Japanese troops landing in Manila. While

more unfortunate incident happened to Rosa while she was passing a Japanese
checkpoint with members of the guerilla movement.

Life is full of rosy tomorrows, life is long, life is all your own to spend in ways that
make you happiest—until it isn't. For 11 days, multifaceted personality Iza Calzado
laid in her hospital bed, looking up at a white ceiling with her labored breathing
echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.
9. New Yorker in Tondo is a play about a run-of-the-mill girl from Tondo named Kikay.
She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,

unrest between all of them. She convinces her mom, Aling Atang, to change into what
looks like a high-society matrona and insists everyone call her mom.
10. The life of Maria Rosa Henson or “Lola Rosa” classically depicts the cruelty of
poverty and powerlessness. In her autobiography, Lola Rosa, survivor of Japanese
war atrocity, leads the readers to visit her life through the book with her own
illustrations and vivid descriptions of people and events long gone. Her story begins
as the daughter of the landlord’s illiterate mistress, Julia. Rosa’s mother, Julia, is the
eldest of the children who began her ‘working’ life as Don Pepe Henson’s housemaid, despite her protestations.

Inequality between the genders is a phenomenon that goes back at least 4,000 years (Lerner 1986). Although the forms and ways in which it has been practiced differ between cultures and change significantly through history, its persistence has led to the formulation of the concept of patriarchy. Patriarchy refers to a set of institutional structures (like property rights, access to positions of power, relationship to sources of income) that are based on the belief that men and women are dichotomous and unequal categories. Key to patriarchy is what might be called the dominant gender ideology toward sexual differences: the assumption that physiological sex differences between males and females are related to differences in their character, behavior, and ability (i.e., their gender). These differences are used to justify a gendered division of social roles and inequality in access to rewards, positions of power, and privilege. The question that feminists ask therefore is: How does this distinction between male and female, and the attribution of different qualities to each, serve to organize our institutions (e.g., the family, law, the occupational structure, religious institutions, the division between public and private) and to perpetuate inequality between the sexes?

It acknowledges that gender inequality has existed for thousands of years and has taken different forms across cultures and history.

                        <p><strong>3. How do male and female characters relate to one another? Are these relationships sources of conflict? Are these conflicts resolved?</strong></p><p>In many ways, male and female characters are quite similar to one another. They both experience the same emotions and often have the same goals. However, their relationships can be sources of conflict. This is because men and women often have different ways of approaching problems and different ways of communicating. These differences can lead to misunderstandings and conflict. However, these conflicts can often be resolved through effective communication and by understanding the other person's perspective.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>9. How does the marital status of a character affect her er decisions or happiness?</strong></p><p>A character’s marital status can be a significant factor in their happiness. Whether a character is married or not can affect their decisions, their contentment, and their overall satisfaction with life.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>10. How does culture view women vs. men?</strong></p><p>Culture has a major impact on how women and men are viewed. In many cultures, women are seen as inferior to men. They are not given the same opportunities and are often not treated with the same respect. This can be a major problem for women who want to succeed in life. In some cultures, women are not even allowed to work or own property. They are seen as property of their husbands or fathers and are not given the same rights as men. This can make it very difficult for women to get ahead in life. In other cultures, women are seen as equals to men. They are given the same opportunities and are treated with the same respect. This can help women to succeed in life and be more respected in society.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>12. What are the power relationships between men and women (or characters assuming male/female roles)?</strong></p><p>In many societies, men have more power than women. This is because men are often seen as being more physically strong and capable than women. They are also often seen as being more logical and rational, which can give them an advantage in decision-making.</p><p>The power relationships between men and women can also vary depending on the specific situation. For example, in some workplaces, women may have more power than men. In other situations, such as in the home, men may have more power than women.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>13. Do characters take on traits from opposite genders? How so? How does this change others' reactions to them?</strong></p><p>It's generally accepted that people do tend to adopt some qualities from the opposite gender, whether it's due to nature or nurture. For example, a man might be more emotional and sensitive than average, while a woman might be more assertive and analytical.</p><p>These traits don't necessarily make someone feel like they're in the wrong body, but they can cause confusion and conflict in relationships. For instance, a man who cries easily might be seen as weak by his male friends, while a woman who's very assertive might be viewed as bossy by her female friends. In some cases, people might be drawn to others who have qualities they lack, which can lead to a more balanced and fulfilling relationship.</p><br />

1. Now, this rich man’s servants were always frying and cooking something good, and
the aroma of the food wafted down to us from the windows of the big house.
2. Dodong thought to himself he would tell his father about Teang when he got home,
after he had unhitched the carabao from the plow, and let it to its shed and fed it.
He was hesitant about saying it, but he wanted his father to know. What he had to
say was of serious import as it would mark a climacteric in his life.
3. When the Americans recaptured the Philippines, they built an air base a few miles
from our barrio. Yankee soldiers became a very common sight.
4. "I am afraid. He may not like me."
"Does that worry you still, Maria?" my brother Leon said. "From the way you talk,
he might be an ogre, for all the world. Except when his leg that was wounded in
the Revolution is troubling him, Father is the mildest-tempered, gentlest man I
know."
5. The sight of the Señora’s flaccidly plump figure, swathed in a loose waist-less
housedress that came down to her ankles, and the faint scent of agua de colonia
blended with kitchen spice, seemed to her the essence of the comfortable world,
and she sighed thinking of the long walk home through the mud, the baby’s legs
straddled to her waist, and Inggo, her husband, waiting for her, his body stinking
of tuba and sweat, squatting on the floor, clad only in his foul undergarments.
6. When war was declared on 5 December 1941, Rosa was 14 years old. Her mother’s

echoing in her ears and her pulse throbbing with an intense cocktail of IV-delivered
medication sloshing in her weakened veins.
8. What I always say and think about the poor is this: the poor are about more than
their poverty. Poverty is awful and dehumanizing, but it’s what people do and how they
act at a given disadvantage that I find interesting and even inspiring as a person and
as an author, not the overwhelming odds themselves. I’ll leave the objective analysis
of poverty to the social scientists and its alleviation to the activists; my job as a fictions is to see and employ it as another means to understand why we do the things we do.

She visited New York and returned a very different person. Her new attitude,

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1. How are</strong><strong> women's lives portrayed in the work?</strong></p><p>In "Dead Stars," women's lives are portrayed primarily in domestic roles and as objects of men's affections. The story depicts women as taking care of children and managing household tasks, while men are depicted in more professional roles.</p><p></p><p><strong>2. Is the</strong><strong> form and content of the work influenced by the writer's gender?</strong></p><p>This is not specified in the critique but one can approach it as that as a woman writer Paz Marquez Benitez could have chosen to represent the women characters differently.</p><p></p><p><strong>3. How do</strong><strong> male and female characters relate to one another? Are these relationships sources of conflict? Are these conflicts resolved?</strong></p><p>In "Dead Stars," the male characters often relate to the female characters in a patriarchal and possessive manner. The central relationship in the story, between Alfredo and Julia, is a source of conflict and ultimately unresolved. Alfredo's continuing affection for Julia creates distance in his marriage and prevents him from fully committing to his wife.</p><p></p><p><strong>4. Does the</strong><strong> work challenge or affirm traditional views of women?</strong></p><p>The critique suggests that "Dead Stars" reinforces traditional views of women as being relegated to domestic roles and as objects of men's affections.</p><p></p><p><strong>5. How do the</strong><strong> images of women in the story reflect patriarchal social forces that have impeded women's efforts to achieve full equality with men?</strong></p><p>The images of women in the story, who are primarily depicted in domestic roles and as objects of men's affections, reflect patriarchal social forces that have limited women's opportunities and autonomy.</p><p></p><p><strong>6. What</strong><strong> marital expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have?</strong></p><p>The characters are expected to conform to traditional gender roles within their marriage, with men as the head of the household and women as subservient. These expectations create distance and dissatisfaction in the marriage between Alfredo and Esperanza.</p><p></p><p><strong>7. What</strong><strong> behavioral expectations are imposed on the characters? What effect do these expectations have?</strong></p><p>Characters are expected to conform to traditional gender norms in terms of their behavior and emotions. Alfredo's emotions and behavior are constrained by societal expectations that men should not show vulnerability or be emotionally attached to women other than their wives.</p><p></p><p><strong>8. If a female</strong><strong> character were male, how would the story be different (and vice versa)?</strong></p><p>If Julia were a male character, the story would likely focus on a different kind of power imbalance, as a man in a relationship with a woman would not be constrained by the same societal expectations. It's possible that the story would have a different outcome as well, with the relationship between Julia and Esperanza being more of a rivalry.</p><p></p><p></p><br />
