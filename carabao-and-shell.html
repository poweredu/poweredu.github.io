STORY: The Carabao and the Shell
One very hot day, when a carabao went into the river to bathe, he met a shell and they began talking together.
“You are very slow,” said the carabao to the shell.
“Oh, no,” replied the shell. “I can beat you in a race.”
“Then let us try and see,” said the carabao.
So they went out on the bank and started to run.
After the carabao had gone a long distance he stopped and called, “Shell!”
And another shell lying by the river answered, “Here I am!”
Then the carabao, thinking that it was the same shell with which he was racing, ran on.
By and by he stopped again and called, “Shell!”
Again another shell answered, “Here I am!”
The carabao was surprised that the shell could keep up with him. But he ran on and on, and every time he stopped to call, another shell answered him. But he was determined that the shell should not beat him, so he ran until he dropped dead.</a>

STORY: The Carabao and the Shell
One very hot day, when a carabao went into the river to bathe, he met a shell and they began talking together.
“You are very slow,” said the carabao to the shell.
“Oh, no,” replied the shell. “I can beat you in a race.”
“Then let us try and see,” said the carabao.
So they went out on the bank and started to run.
After the carabao had gone a long distance he stopped and called, “Shell!”
And another shell lying by the river answered, “Here I am!”
Then the carabao, thinking that it was the same shell with which he was racing, ran on.
By and by he stopped again and called, “Shell!”
Again another shell answered, “Here I am!”
The carabao was surprised that the shell could keep up with him. But he ran on and on, and every time he stopped to call, another shell answered him. But he was determined that the shell should not beat him, so he ran until he dropped dead.</a>

STORY: The Carabao and the Shell
One very hot day, when a carabao went into the river to bathe, he met a shell and they began talking together.
“You are very slow,” said the carabao to the shell.
“Oh, no,” replied the shell. “I can beat you in a race.”
“Then let us try and see,” said the carabao.
So they went out on the bank and started to run.
After the carabao had gone a long distance he stopped and called, “Shell!”
And another shell lying by the river answered, “Here I am!”
Then the carabao, thinking that it was the same shell with which he was racing, ran on.
By and by he stopped again and called, “Shell!”
Again another shell answered, “Here I am!”
The carabao was surprised that the shell could keep up with him. But he ran on and on, and every time he stopped to call, another shell answered him. But he was determined that the shell should not beat him, so he ran until he dropped dead.</h2><br />
                        <p>The moral lesson of the story if we apply it in real life is that don't degrade other people even if you think that you are much higher than other people because in Matthew 23:12 says that Whosever shall exalt himself shall be based,and he that humble himself shall be exalt .</p><p></p><p></p><p>goodluck, bb ;)</p><p></p><br />

The carapace and plastron each arose from two types of bone: dermal bones that form in the skin and endochondral bone (bone arising from cartilage) derived from the skeleton</p><p></p><p>The gill filaments in fish have functions like lungs in people: it's the organ responsible for absorbing oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide. The gills also regulate levels of mineral ions and the pH of the blood, as well as being the primary site of nitrogenous waste excretion, in the form of ammonia.</p><p></p><p>They plow fields, carry and move heavy objects and they are even used for transportation. Carabaos are widely distributed in all the larger islands of the Philippine archipelago. Carabao Horn accessories are created from water buffalo that are not slaughtered for their horns.</p><p></p><p>Together with the flexible palato-maxillary apparatus ("upper jaws"), this three-part lower jaw allows snakes to open their mouths very wide, walk their heads over, and consume things that are as big as they are without breaking them into smaller pieces or using their non-existent hands.</p><p></p><p>The primary use for webbed feet is paddling through water. Here's how it works: as the bird pulls its foot backwards through the water, the toes spread apart, causing the webs to spread out. The webs push more water than just a bird foot with spread-out toes would push.</p><br />

STORY: The Carabao and the Shell
One very hot day, when a carabao went into the river to bathe, he met a shell and they began talking together.
“You are very slow,” said the carabao to the shell.
“Oh, no,” replied the shell. “I can beat you in a race.”
“Then let us try and see,” said the carabao.
So they went out on the bank and started to run.
After the carabao had gone a long distance he stopped and called, “Shell!”
And another shell lying by the river answered, “Here I am!”
Then the carabao, thinking that it was the same shell with which he was racing, ran on.
By and by he stopped again and called, “Shell!”
Again another shell answered, “Here I am!”
The carabao was surprised that the shell could keep up with him. But he ran on and on, and every time he stopped to call, another shell answered him. But he was determined that the shell should not beat him, so he ran until he dropped dead.</h2><br />

One very hot day, when a carabao went into the river to bathe, he met a shell and they began talking together. “You are very slow,” said the carabao to the shell. “Oh, no,” replied the shell. “I can beat you in a race.” “Then let us try and see,” said the carabao. So they went out on the bank and started to run. After the carabao had gone a long distance he stopped and called, “Shell!” And another shell lying by the river answered, “Here I am!” Then the carabao, thinking that it was the same shell with which he was racing, ran on. By and by he stopped again and called, “Shell!” And another shell answered, “Here I am!” The carabao was surprised that the shell could keep up with him. But he ran on and on, and every time he stopped to call, another shell answered him. But he was determined that the shell should not beat him, so he ran until he dropped dead.</h2><br />
