Iyon ang dahilan ng pagkakaroon ng pagbabago sa mapa ng mga lugar doon. Si Ka Andoy ang pinakamatanda sa mga nakatira sa malapit sa paanan ng bulkan. Hindi niya malilimutan ang malagim na pangyayaring iyon. Bata pa siya nang ang Bulkang Taal ay pumutok. Kararating pa lamang nila ng kanyang mga kaibigan mula sa panghaharana. Hindi niya alintana ang sungit ng panahon. Maya-maya pa’y umuga nang malakas ang kanilang tinitirhan. Ang nasa isip nila’y katapusan na iyon ng lahat. Nakabanaag sila ng liwanag mula sa madilim na kalawakan. Nagsilabas sila upang mailigtas at makakita ng liwanag. Bigla silang nakakita ng magandang anyo ng babae, nakadamit ng puti na may balabal na kulay asul. Mabilis ang lakad nito habang pabalik- balik sa naglalakihang alon ng lawa. Nililibot din niya ang bulkan habang iwinawagayway ang panyo sa bunganga ng bulkan. Maya-maya pa’y kumalma na ang lawa at ang bulkan. Kasunod niyon ay ang pagkawala ng magandang babae. Para kina Ka Andoy at sa naninirahan doon, ang babaeng kanilang nabanaagan ay ang tinatawag na Lady of Caysasay. Siya rin ang nasa Subic, baryo ng Lemery na nakitang nagwagayway ng panyo sa umuulang lava at apoy. Kung hindi dahil sa kanya, ang Subic daw ay wala na sa mapa ngayon.​</a>

Magdala ng iba’t ibang larawang ginupit na may kaugnayan sa akdang tatalakayin. ANG BABAENG MAY HAWAK NA PANYO Ang mga taong naninirahan sa paligid ng lawa ng Taal ay di pa nalilimutan ang mga nasalanta sa pagputok ng Bulkang Taal noong 1911. Iyon ang dahilan ng pagkakaroon ng pagbabago sa mapa ng mga lugar doon. Si Ka Andoy ang pinakamatanda sa mga nakatira sa malapit sa paanan ng bulkan. Hindi niya malilimutan ang malagim na pangyayaring iyon. Bata pa siya nang ang Bulkang Taal ay pumutok. Kararating pa lamang nila ng kanyang mga kaibigan mula sa panghaharana. Hindi niya alintana ang sungit ng panahon. Maya-maya pa’y umuga nang malakas ang kanilang tinitirhan. Ang nasa isip nila’y katapusan na iyon ng lahat. Nakabanaag sila ng liwanag mula sa madilim na kalawakan. Nagsilabas sila upang mailigtas at makakita ng liwanag. Bigla silang nakakita ng magandang anyo ng babae, nakadamit ng puti na may balabal na kulay asul. Mabilis ang lakad nito habang pabalik- balik sa naglalakihang alon ng lawa. Nililibot din niya ang bulkan habang iwinawagayway ang panyo sa bunganga ng bulkan. Maya-maya pa’y kumalma na ang lawa at ang bulkan. Kasunod niyon ay ang pagkawala ng magandang babae. Para kina Ka Andoy at sa naninirahan doon, ang babaeng kanilang nabanaagan ay ang tinatawag na Lady of Caysasay. Siya rin ang nasa Subic, baryo ng Lemery na nakitang nagwagayway ng panyo sa umuulang lava at apoy. Kung hindi dahil sa kanya, ang Subic daw ay wala na sa mapa ngayon.

Kaugnayan ng mga pangyayari sa binasa sa mga kaganapan sa iba pang lugar ng bansa:______________________________________________________  ANG BABAENG MAY HAWAK NA PANYO Ang mga taong naninirahan sa paligid ng lawa ng Taal ay di pa nalilimutan ang mga nasalanta sa pagputok ng Bulkang Taal noong 1911. Iyon ang dahilan ng pagkakaroon ng pagbabago sa mapa ng mga lugar doon. Si Ka Andoy ang pinakamatanda sa mga nakatira sa malapit sa paanan ng bulkan. Hindi niya malilimutan ang malagim na pangyayaring iyon. Bata pa siya nang ang Bulkang Taal ay pumutok. Kararating pa lamang nila ng kanyang mga kaibigan mula sa panghaharana. Hindi niya alintana ang sungit ng panahon. Maya-maya pa’y umuga nang malakas ang kanilang tinitirhan. Ang nasa isip nila’y katapusan na iyon ng lahat. Nakabanaag sila ng liwanag mula sa madilim na kalawakan. Nagsilabas sila upang mailigtas at makakita ng liwanag. Bigla silang nakakita ng magandang anyo ng babae, nakadamit ng puti na may balabal na kulay asul. Mabilis ang lakad nito habang pabalik- balik sa naglalakihang alon ng lawa. Nililibot din niya ang bulkan habang iwinawagayway ang panyo sa bunganga ng bulkan. Maya-maya pa’y kumalma na ang lawa at ang bulkan. Kasunod niyon ay ang pagkawala ng magandang babae. Para kina Ka Andoy at sa naninirahan doon, ang babaeng kanilang nabanaagan ay ang tinatawag na Lady of Caysasay. Siya rin ang nasa Subic, baryo ng Lemery na nakitang nagwagayway ng panyo sa umuulang lava at apoy. Kung hindi dahil sa kanya, ang Subic daw ay wala na sa mapa ngayon.​</h2><br />

Kaugnayan ng mga pangyayari sa binasa sa mga kaganapan sa iba pang lugar ng bansa:______________________________________________________IV. KASUNDUAN 1. Magsaliksik ng mga kuwentong bayan sa Pilipinas. Basahin at ibigay ang buod ng mga binasa. 2. Basahin ang kuwentong bayan ng Mindanao na may pamagat na “Ang Munting Ibon”. Humanda sa talakayan.3. Magdala ng iba’t ibang larawang ginupit na may kaugnayan sa akdang tatalakayin. ANG BABAENG MAY HAWAK NA PANYO Ang mga taong naninirahan sa paligid ng lawa ng Taal ay di pa nalilimutan ang mga nasalanta sa pagputok ng Bulkang Taal noong 1911. Iyon ang dahilan ng pagkakaroon ng pagbabago sa mapa ng mga lugar doon. Si Ka Andoy ang pinakamatanda sa mga nakatira sa malapit sa paanan ng bulkan. Hindi niya malilimutan ang malagim na pangyayaring iyon. Bata pa siya nang ang Bulkang Taal ay pumutok. Kararating pa lamang nila ng kanyang mga kaibigan mula sa panghaharana. Hindi niya alintana ang sungit ng panahon. Maya-maya pa’y umuga nang malakas ang kanilang tinitirhan. Ang nasa isip nila’y katapusan na iyon ng lahat. Nakabanaag sila ng liwanag mula sa madilim na kalawakan. Nagsilabas sila upang mailigtas at makakita ng liwanag. Bigla silang nakakita ng magandang anyo ng babae, nakadamit ng puti na may balabal na kulay asul. Mabilis ang lakad nito habang pabalik- balik sa naglalakihang alon ng lawa. Nililibot din niya ang bulkan habang iwinawagayway ang panyo sa bunganga ng bulkan. Maya-maya pa’y kumalma na ang lawa at ang bulkan. Kasunod niyon ay ang pagkawala ng magandang babae. Para kina Ka Andoy at sa naninirahan doon, ang babaeng kanilang nabanaagan ay ang tinatawag na Lady of Caysasay. Siya rin ang nasa Subic, baryo ng Lemery na nakitang nagwagayway ng panyo sa umuulang lava at apoy. Kung hindi dahil sa kanya, ang Subic daw ay wala na sa mapa ngayon.
