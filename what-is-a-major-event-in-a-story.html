</p><p>REVIEW: Netflix’s ‘The Christmas Chronicles’ follows formula for heartwarming Christmas story

</p><p>
</p><p>Kurt Russell stars in Netflix’s new holiday film “The Christmas Chronicles,” released Thursday. COURTESY OF MICHAEL GIBSON/ NETFLIX
</p><p>As Thanksgiving has already become a memory, Netflix is promoting its newest holiday original, “The Christmas Chronicles.” A pair of brother and sister embark on a surprising journey after accidentally crashing Santa Claus’ sleigh.
</p><p>
</p><p>The story follows two siblings who go on a once-in-a-lifetime Christmas Eve adventure after attempting to film Santa Claus making his yearly visit.
</p><p>
</p><p>At first glance, some of the components of the story seem to come right out of the cliche Christmas movie handbook. The main family features a deceased parent, a single parent who always seems to be working and a pair of siblings who just can’t see eye to eye. Oh, and one of the siblings doesn’t believe in Santa Claus.  </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
