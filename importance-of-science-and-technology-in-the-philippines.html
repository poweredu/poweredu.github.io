                            5. identify alteast one issue in the Philippines what science and technology related policies could be developed &amp;important to solve this issue ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>• Water filtration systems should be distributed in the provinces. It should be implemented by the government to ensure the health and well-being of the Filipinos living in rural areas, where the supply of safe drinking water is scarce. They should dig deep wells with filtering capabilities for the citizens. The Department of Science and Technology is currently developing a cost-effective water filtration system using ceramic and clay in the process. I hope it will be carried out to the needy citizens upon its release and development.</p><p></p><p>• Hospitals and health clinics should be built by our government, each town or city should have at least one.</p><p></p><p>• Farm to market roads should be built in many communities, so that farmers would have a bigger chance of increasing their income by cutting the agricultural supply chain that the abusive middlemen exploit and take advantage of.</p><p></p><p>• Farming should be MECHANIZED, to increase the agricultural output of farms and to give farmers the chance to have the time in different activities while the machinery takes care of all the hard manual work under the heat of the sun.</p><p></p><p>• Vertical housing should be provided to poor residents in big cities, so that they won’t end up being squatters in government and private-owned land. The residential units can be sold in an affordable price with reasonable monthly rates that the poor working class can afford.</p><p></p><p>• Many roads should be opened and constructed. This is to avoid the traffic congestion that makes the life of urban Filipinos miserable. There are a lot of elevated and elliptical roads that can be constructed above the traditional highways to provide vehicles with many options on where are they going to pass-by.</p><p></p><p>• An efficient, disaster response system should be created. This is imperative if the Philippines is really aiming for zero casualties during calamities, owing the fact that our archipelago are frequented by earthquakes, storms, tidal surge, volcanic eruptions and many similar disasters. Highly mobile disaster vehicles such as amphibious vehicles and ambulances should be deployed in every town, city and municipality.</p><p></p><p>• Our railroads should be revived. Especially, the Ferrocaril de Manila, a traditional commuter railway that runs from Dagupan City in Pangasinan in the north, down to Manila in the National Capital Region and down to Legazpi Albay in the south. It is the most common form of transportation during the American period, and according to the older population, it’s fast and cost-effective. Sadly, the said commuter rail was destroyed during the Second World War and was never rehabilitated. Today, only a portion of the railway from Tutuban, Manila to Calamba, Laguna is currently in use. The rest had been defunct in the past few decades.</p><p></p><p>With proper technology, navigable river highways can be created to decongest Manila, like the Manila Bay-Pasig River-Marikina River- Laguna de Bay waterway that will connect Metro Manila eastward to Rizal and Laguna provinces, or the Manila Bay-Angat River-Pampanga River-Peñaranda River-Tarlac River-Agno River mega waterway, that could potentially connect Manila to the northern provinces of Bulacan, Nueva Ecija, Pampanga, Pangasinan and Tarlac with the province of Benguet as its extreme northernmost passenger port.</p><p></p><p>• Renewable clean energy should be preferred over traditional ones. The Philippines have vast potential for its renewable energy, because it is abundant in natural resources and is located in a region with favorable climatic conditions. We have vast potential in harnessing our resources for biomass, geothermal, hydropower, solar and wind production and making it as a sustainable source of energy, reducing the reliance on coal, petroleum and other non-renewable sources.</p><p></p><p>As for the problem with our garbage disposal, we can create garbage liquification and gasification facilities to convert our filth into a usable energy source. Many recyclable trash should also be distributed in recycling facilities to avoid being stuck in landfills.</p><p></p><p>• Degraded and denuded lands should be reforested again. We should plant more trees to preserve the ecological balance of our country and prevent our animal and plant species from becoming extinct. We should plant the right species of trees, and we should prefer native ones ( Apitong, Ipil, Kamagong, Lauan, Narra, Yakal, etc) more than foreign ones to preserve our tree species once found in our primeval forests.</p><p></p><p>Our coastal areas should be planted with mangroves to increase the vitality of our marine ecosystems and increase the food production of our fishermen. Mangroves also serve as natural barriers against water-borne disasters, such as tidal surges, whirlpools and other similar phenomena.</p><p></p><p>These are just some of the important things that I want to emphasize in tackling some of the important issues plaguing my country today.</p><br />
