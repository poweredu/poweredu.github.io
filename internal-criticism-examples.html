                                            "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".

                            8. "The Future Gender Equality" Robert Grant The future Gender equality Recruiters are key to gender solution, says Robert Grant Recruiters know about hiring, but they could- and arguably should be more influential to businesses around issues of gender equality. But this comes with responsibility and the need for any chosen recruiter to prioritise diversity as a business objective. Monitoring diversity means recruiters can address discrepancies. For example, equally qualified and sometimes more qualified women are not equally hired. Women's tenure is higher in banks than for men and fewer women are employed in the digital industry. To stay competitive, businesses must encourage hiring managers to understand the implications of these trends and should work in partnership with recruiters. Only by investing in good programs can recruiters properly support clients. IT systems that allow monitoring of all relevant diversity across both the internal employee and candidate recruitment lifecycle are now critical to good quality intelligence. Staff should be expected to work to inclusion guiding principles, but businesses need support systems in place and investment in on-going development on the value of diversity to the business. In 2013 Cititec is developing its people in strengths-based leadership. The next step is to use the strengths-based approach in recruitment. cititec man recruitment for a technical w Communicating transparency, especially in equal pay and flexible working, are critical. "Early in 2013 we launched a new Flexible Working Policy. Some of the barriers highlighted during the consultation period helped avoid ill feeling from people who may cover for their colleagues and for non-careers who sometimes feel their needs are overlooked. Now anyone can ask for flexible working and new IT systems mean we have the ability to support them," explains Cititec's CEO Stephen Grant. "Consequently there has been an increase of 33 per cent in senior women employed so far." Later in the year Cititec and Sateo, a specialist equality consultancy, will Citite Development launch Program. Aimed at internal staff, candidates, and clients, the program will bring men and women together to develop key leadership skills based on the strengths finder model. Only by recruiters investing in equality and working in partnership with clients, can issues around gender be explored alongside a problem solving approach. True gender equality can therefore start to be realized, and recruiters are the key to the solution. Directions: Read carefully the article, "The Future Gender Equality".
