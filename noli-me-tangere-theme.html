                                            true or false 1. During the Pre-Spanish Period, Jose Rizal's works such as Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo were written to awake the mind of the Filipino people. 2. Because of the archipelagic nature of the Philippines, its geographical features, and the presence of various ethno-linguistic groups in the country, regional literature has become rich and varied. 3. Oral and written literatures were not present in the Filipino culture before the colonizers came. 4. The most prominent characteristic of Philippine literature during the Spanish era was the use of religion as the content in the works of the early literature, 5. The separate, yet parallel developments of Philippine literature in English and those in Tagalog and other languages of the archipelago during the American period only proved that literature and writing in whatever language and in whatever climate were able to survive mainly through the active imagination of writers. 6. Poetry works during the EDSA I Period were romantic and revolutionary. 7. Doctrina Cristiana and Urbana and Felisa were written to support or contradict the Catholic Church during the Period of Enlightenment. 8. It was during the American Period when Filipinos witnessed newspapers which were once branded crony newspapers become instant opposition papers. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 9. Filipino literature was given a break during the Japanese period. Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 10. The American Period presented new trends in writing using modern technology. 11. Poetry during the New Society Period was dealt with patience and regard for native culture and customs. 12. Philippine regional literature can be best described as dynamic. 13. Imagery in poetry pertains to mental pictures. 14. Literature developed alongside Philippine history is a valid observation of literary development in the Philippines. 15. The use of the vernacular in regional literature is encouraged so that the culture and tradition of a people are upheld despite effects of modernization.​</a>

The most prominent characteristic of Philippine literature during the Spanish era was the use of religion as the content in the works of the early literature, 5.

Poetry works during the EDSA I Period were romantic and revolutionary. 7. Doctrina Cristiana and Urbana and Felisa were written to support or contradict the Catholic Church during the Period of Enlightenment. 8. It was during the American Period when Filipinos witnessed newspapers which were once branded crony newspapers become instant opposition papers.

Many wrote plays, poems, short stories, etc. Topics and themes were often about life in the provinces. 10. The American Period presented new trends in writing using modern technology. 11. Poetry during the New Society Period was dealt with patience and regard for native culture and customs. 12. Philippine regional literature can be best described as dynamic. 13.

The use of the vernacular in regional literature is encouraged so that the culture and tradition of a people are upheld despite effects of modernization.​</h2><br />
