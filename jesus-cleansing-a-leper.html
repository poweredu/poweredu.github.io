They stood at a distance from him and raised their voice, saying, "Jesus, Master! Have pity on us!" And when he saw them, he said, "Go show yourselves to the priests." As they were going they were cleansed. And one of them, realizing he had been healed, returned, glorifying God in a loud voice; and he fell at the feet of Jesus and thanked him. He was a Samaritan. Jesus said in reply, "Ten were cleansed, were they not? Where are the other nine? Has none but this foreigner returned to give thanks to God?" Then he said to him, "Stand up and go, your faith has saved you." patulong po sana ​</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Simon the Leper is also sometimes identified as the same person as Lazarus of Bethany, or identified as his father or brother. This is because Matthew and Mark mention Simon, while John mentions Lazarus, but all four gospels assume one lodging at Bethany during the last week.</p><p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>The reason why Jesus calls Simon, Peter is because of the verse number 16:16 'You are The Christ, the son of the living God. ' Note the number 16:16 here. Jesus in Mark 3:13:19 does another remarkably divine thing, in Mark 3:16, he assigns that number verse 16 to Simon Peter!</p><p></p><br />

                        <p>When lepers were outcast as unclean from their family and society, they were isolated and lost their social and financial status. They had no means for their living. They might even lose their hope in life and faith in God. So, regardless of their past status, all the lepers become equals. Thus, the Jewish and Samaritan lepers became one team of “unclean” or “untouchables” for mutual support. While keeping legal distance from the community, they used to hang around the village as beggars to obtain food or other necessities of life from their sympathetic family members or any kindhearted villagers. A similar union of lepers is found in 2Kings 7:3 where four lepers were at a city gate during the time of Prophet Elisha.</p><br />

As he was going into a village, ten men who had leprosy met him. He threw himself at Jesus' feet and thanked him – and he was a Samaritan. </p><br />

                            14. Who is the thankful leper?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>WHO IS THE THANKFUL LEPER?
</p><p> On the way to Jerusalem he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee. And as he entered a village, he was met by ten lepers, who stood at a distance and lifted up their voices, saying, “Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.” When he saw them he said to them, “Go and show yourselves to the priests.” And as they went they were cleansed. Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice; and he fell on his face at Jesus’ feet, giving him thanks. Now he was a Samaritan. Then Jesus answered, “Were not ten cleansed? Where are the nine? Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?” And he said to him, “Rise and go your way; your faith has made you well.
</p><p>
</p><p>Jesus, in his ministry healed many people. Many of those people he healed followed him, yet many more simply went on their way. This passage tells of another of Jesus’ healings, however the emphasis is not focused on the healing given to those suffering people, but rather on Jesus’ dismay that of all those men only a Samaritan; the lowest of the low in that society, who the church at that time claimed they did not know God properly, was the only one to give thanks and glorify God for the wonderful thing He had done for him.
</p><p>
</p><p>The Samaritan was nobody special. He was simply grateful to God that His mercy had come down to him even in his low estate. God still works in this way. In Jesus God came down to us to tell the Good news that God has forgiven us, and to suffer the penalty of sin; to die so that we might live.That is his message to you and to all people.
</p><p>
</p><p>Having received that gift we have come back to give our thanks and to share in Christ’s ministry to the lost and broken. We are the thankful leper.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

The Cleansing of the Leper (Mk. 1:40-45)
The Healing of a boy with a Demon (Mk. 9:14-29)</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.The Parable of the Great Feast (Luke 14: 16-24)
</p><p>&gt;The Parable of the Great Banquet
</p><p>15 When one of those at the table with him heard this, he said to Jesus, “Blessed is the one who will eat at the feast in the kingdom of God.”
</p><p>
</p><p>16 Jesus replied: “A certain man was preparing a great banquet and invited many guests. 17 At the time of the banquet he sent his servant to tell those who had been invited, ‘Come, for everything is now ready.’
</p><p>
</p><p>18 “But they all alike began to make excuses. The first said, ‘I have just bought a field, and I must go and see it. Please excuse me.’
</p><p>
</p><p>19 “Another said, ‘I have just bought five yoke of oxen, and I’m on my way to try them out. Please excuse me.’
</p><p>
</p><p>20 “Still another said, ‘I just got married, so I can’t come.’
</p><p>
</p><p>21 “The servant came back and reported this to his master. Then the owner of the house became angry and ordered his servant, ‘Go out quickly into the streets and alleys of the town and bring in the poor, the crippled, the blind and the lame.’
</p><p>
</p><p>22 “‘Sir,’ the servant said, ‘what you ordered has been done, but there is still room.’
</p><p>
</p><p>23 “Then the master told his servant, ‘Go out to the roads and country lanes and compel them to come in, so that my house will be full. 24 I tell you, not one of those who were invited will get a taste of my banquet.
</p><p>2.The Cleansing of the Leper (Mk. 1:40-45)
</p><p>Mark 1:40-45 says, A man with leprosy came and knelt in front of Jesus, begging to be healed. “If you are willing, you can heal me and make me clean,” he said. 41 Moved with compassion, Jesus reached out and touched him. “I am willing,” he said. “Be healed!” 42 Instantly the leprosy disappeared, and the man was healed. 43 Then Jesus sent him on his way with a stern warning: 44 “Don’t tell anyone about this. Instead, go to the priest and let him examine you. Take along the offering required in the law of Moses for those who have been healed of leprosy. This will be a public testimony that you have been cleansed.” 45 But the man went and spread the word, proclaiming to everyone what had happened. As a result, large crowds soon surrounded Jesus, and he couldn’t publicly enter a town anywhere. He had to stay out in the secluded places, but people from everywhere kept coming to him.  </p><p>3.Jesus Heals a Demon-Possessed Boy
</p><p>14 When they returned to the other disciples, they saw a large crowd surrounding them, and some teachers of religious law were arguing with them. 15 When the crowd saw Jesus, they were overwhelmed with awe, and they ran to greet him.
</p><p>
</p><p>16 “What is all this arguing about?” Jesus asked.
</p><p>
</p><p>17 One of the men in the crowd spoke up and said, “Teacher, I brought my son so you could heal him. He is possessed by an evil spirit that won’t let him talk. 18 And whenever this spirit seizes him, it throws him violently to the ground. Then he foams at the mouth and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid.[a] So I asked your disciples to cast out the evil spirit, but they couldn’t do it.”
</p><p>
</p><p>19 Jesus said to them,[b] “You faithless people! How long must I be with you? How long must I put up with you? Bring the boy to me.”
</p><p>
</p><p>20 So they brought the boy. But when the evil spirit saw Jesus, it threw the child into a violent convulsion, and he fell to the ground, writhing and foaming at the mouth.
</p><p>
</p><p>21 “How long has this been happening?” Jesus asked the boy’s father.
</p><p>
</p><p>He replied, “Since he was a little boy. 22 The spirit often throws him into the fire or into water, trying to kill him. Have mercy on us and help us, if you can.”
</p><p>
</p><p>23 “What do you mean, ‘If I can’?” Jesus asked. “Anything is possible if a person believes.”
</p><p>
</p><p>24 The father instantly cried out, “I do believe, but help me overcome my unbelief!”
</p><p>
</p><p>25 When Jesus saw that the crowd of onlookers was growing, he rebuked the evil[c] spirit. “Listen, you spirit that makes this boy unable to hear and speak,” he said. “I command you to come out of this child and never enter him again!”
</p><p>
</p><p>26 Then the spirit screamed and threw the boy into another violent convulsion and left him. The boy appeared to be dead. A murmur ran through the crowd as people said, “He’s dead.” 27 But Jesus took him by the hand and helped him to his feet, and he stood up.
</p><p>
</p><p>28 Afterward, when Jesus was alone in the house with his disciples, they asked him, “Why couldn’t we cast out that evil spirit?”
</p><p>
</p><p>29 Jesus replied, “This kind can be cast out only by prayer</p><br />

                            24. how does Luke describe leper?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>For “leprosy” in the Old and New Testaments, read “defilement”, or “ceremonial defilement”. Do not use the term “leper” to describe a person suffering from the modern disease of leprosy. The accepted term is a “person affected by leprosy”. ... Remember that Biblical leprosy is NOT modern leprosy / Hansen's disease.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Sana makatulong pa mark naman po ako ng brainliest plsss </p><br />
