                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In high school and college it is likely that you will receive some kind of encouragement to travel, study or work abroad. It may seem like you have a lot going on so you don’t seriously consider these opportunities or maybe you write them off since you plan on traveling later in life. I would encourage traveling at any age, but the earlier you can learn the lessons travel teaches the better.</p><p></p><p>When you are young you are still finding yourself and preparing for your school and career. The skills and experience you gain from traveling abroad can give you life-long personal benefits as well as a leg up in the professional world.</p><p></p><p>In high school and college you have the luxury of having flexibility since you can study anywhere in the world and have relatively long study breaks.
