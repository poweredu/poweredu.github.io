The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the relationship to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.Luna stayed in the garden for some time. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.

One day it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only one who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, “Richness, can you take me with you?” Richness answered, “No, I can’t. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.” Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. “Vanity, please help me!” “I can’t help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat,” Vanity answered. Sadness also passed close by, so Love asked, “Sadness, let me go with you.” “Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!” Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice, “Come, Love, I will take you.” It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went his own way. Realizing how much she owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, “Who helped me?” “It was Time,” Knowledge answered. “Time?” asked Love. “But why did Time help me?” Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, “Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.”Spot adjectives as many as you can​</a>

Why there is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god." 
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the relationship to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for some time. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her.

Instead, he went out to the riverbank, rolled in the wet mud and covered his small green body with sticky black mud, On a hot June day, while babysitting the frog family's new tadpoles, he took the little ones out to the riverbank to play, even though his mother had asked him to stay with them in the pond while she was away And so it went, time and again Franky never followed his mother's requests. Of course, Franky's mother became very worried about his behavior. But no matter how hard she tried to teach him to be well behaved, it was to no avail. As the years went by, Franky grew into a handsome, strong, young bullfrog, while his mother was becoming older and weaker. Sadly, his disobedient attitude was still the same. Eventually, his mother became very sick and called him to her side to make one last request. "Please bury my body by the riverbank when I die,” she pleaded. She deliberately asked him to do so because she was certain that he would refuse to follow her instruction and do the opposite. It was be hope to be buried on the sunny side on the mountain plateau. Franky was very sad when his mother finally passed away. He deeply regretted that he never obeyed her and had not listened to her advice while she was alive. So, for once, he decided to grant her wish - he buried her by the riverbank! When it rained, he worried constantly that the water would rise and the river would overflow its bank. Alas! One summer day during monsoon season, heavy rainfall lasted for several days and washed his mother's grave away. Poor Franky sat in the pouring rain by the riverbank, and cried and cried. And that's why, to this day, frogs croak when it rains. The moral of the story is to teach children to obey and respect their parents before it's too late. In Korea, parents playfully tease disobedient children by calling them "green frogs.” 1. When did this story happen? 2. Where did the frogs live? 3. How many characters are present in the story? 4. What did the mother ask Franky to do? 5. Did he obey his mother's request? What did Franky do when he was asked to babysit his younger sibli​​</a>

children and went about her tasks happily–fetching water, gathering gabi
leaves, and digging camote for supper.
Once cloudy day, when the Sun was home, the Moon had to go to the river
for water. She crooned the children to sleep and called to her husband.
“Dear husband, I am going to fetch water. Watch over the children, but do
not go near them because you know what will happen if you do.” And after
the warning, she left.
The Sun looked lovingly at his children. He had never before been able to
really know them or even get near them. Overcome with love and affection,
he kissed them. To his horror, they shriveled up before his eyes and
crumbled to ashes.
His anguish was great. He moaned and cried. Suddenly he remembered
what her wife had told–not to touch the children! Not knowing what to do,
he hid in the forest.
Soon after this the Moon returned. A water jar was balanced on her head
and she carried a bundle of freshly cut gabi leaves in her arms. Laying down
the jar and leaves, she turned to look for her children. Wild was her grief to
find only ashes where her lovely brown babies had once been.
Her screams and lamentations reached her husband in the forest, and his
pity overcoming his fear, he went home. However, as soon as the Moon saw
him, her wailing became louder.
“My husband, why did you do it? Did I not tell you never to touch or even
draw near our children? Why did you disobey me?”
“I couldn’t help kissing them, O wife; they looked so sweet. I have never
seen anything so sweet before. Forgive me, O moon! Forgive me,” he
begged her.
But the Moon would not be comforted. Her reproaches increased in
intensity. In the end, the Sun got angry.
“Mang-ad!” he shouted. “Did you say that I disobeyed you? How dare you
think that you are superior to me, that you can order me what to do. Mang-
ad! Slave! How dare you say that I disobeyed you!”
“Ai!” she moaned. “I am nothing, nothing at all! Then, my children are
nothing too!” And with one defiant sweep of her arm, she scattered their
ashes to the four winds.
Horrified and enraged, the Sun seized the gabi leaves and threw them in his
wife’s face and dashed out of the house.
When he returned very late that night, his ill temper was gone. He regretted
having shouted at his wife. He found the house dark and empty. His wife
had fled, but pinpoints of glimmering light in the distance told him where
she was, for he knew the lights were his children following their mother in
her flight.
So started the endless cycle of the Sun chasing the Moon and the Moon
fleeing from the Sun. The Moon is forever with her children, the many tiny
lights we call stars. Now and then a shooting star breaks across the path of
the Moon. It is nothing more than an attempt from her husband to make
her and their two children return to him. But the Moon speeds away faster,
sometimes leaving the sky altogether, with only her star-babies there. This
happens when the marks of the gabi leaves on the Moon’s face swell, and
she remembers the pain and humiliation of her husband’s anger when he
threw the gabi leaves to her face and called her mang-ad (property) and
binotong (slave).

                                            Love and Time (1.)Once upon a time, there was an island where all the feelings lived: Happiness. Sadness, Knowledge, and all of the others, including Love. One day, it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. (2.) Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?' Richness answered, "No, I can't. there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place for you here." (3.) Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. "Vanity, please help me.!" I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered. (4.) Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh... Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!" (5.) Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice. "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. Wh they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way. Realizing how much was owed elder, Love asked knowledge, another elder, "Who helped me?" "It was Time," know ne help me?"​</a>

                                            Why There is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods.
The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they has many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.
The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.

 My Wonderful Weekend
On the weekend, my cousins came to stay from out of town. Their names are
Jeremy and Georgia. I love spending time with them.
Firstly, we went to the huge playground at the park near our house. Jeremy,
Georgia, and I pretended that we were fierce pirates. We felt so brave, bold, and
adventurous!
After that, we had a picnic lunch on the grass under the trees. We ate some
delicious sandwiches, fruit and cake. Jeremy loved the chocolate cake so much
that he ate three pieces!
Next, we all went to the cinema. My cousins and I felt overjoyed and very
excited about going to see a movie. It was scary and funny with a happy ending.
I loved spending the weekend with Jeremy and Georgia. I feel so lucky to have
such wonderful cousins. I hope they can come and stay at my house again very
soon.

The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the relationship to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.Luna stayed in the garden for some time. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.

Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island had almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, “Richness, can you take me with you?” Richness answered, “No, I can’t. There is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place here for you.” Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. “Vanity, please help me!” “I can’t help you, Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat,” Vanity answered. Sadness also passed close by, so Love asked, “Sadness, let me go with you.” “Oh . . . Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!” Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice, “Come, Love, I will take you.” It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. When they arrived at dry land, the elder went his own way. Realizing how much she owed to the elder, Love asked Knowledge, another elder, “Who helped me?” “It was Time,” Knowledge answered. “Time?” asked Love. “But why did Time help me?” Knowledge smiled with deep wisdom and answered, “Because only Time is capable of understanding how valuable Love is.”Spot adjectives as many as you can​</h2><br />

Why there is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods. The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god." 
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they have many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the relationship to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for some time. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again. 
The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.</h2><br />

                            7. WHY DO FROGS CRY UNDER THE RAIN KOREAN FOLKTALE Long ago in a small pond, Franky, the green frog lived with his mother. He was a humppy little trop and his mother loved him very much. But he was a little green rebel who never obeyed her One morning his mother said, "Please yo catch some flies for dinner tonight "Instead, he len bome to play in the river with Todd, the turtle. "Honey, will you please go to the market for me?" his mother asked, "I need some lily pad flour 10 make biscuits." "No!" he cried, disrespectfully. Instead, he went out to the riverbank, rolled in the wet mud and covered his small green body with sticky black mud, On a hot June day, while babysitting the frog family's new tadpoles, he took the little ones out to the riverbank to play, even though his mother had asked him to stay with them in the pond while she was away And so it went, time and again Franky never followed his mother's requests. Of course, Franky's mother became very worried about his behavior. But no matter how hard she tried to teach him to be well behaved, it was to no avail. As the years went by, Franky grew into a handsome, strong, young bullfrog, while his mother was becoming older and weaker. Sadly, his disobedient attitude was still the same. Eventually, his mother became very sick and called him to her side to make one last request. "Please bury my body by the riverbank when I die,” she pleaded. She deliberately asked him to do so because she was certain that he would refuse to follow her instruction and do the opposite. It was be hope to be buried on the sunny side on the mountain plateau. Franky was very sad when his mother finally passed away. He deeply regretted that he never obeyed her and had not listened to her advice while she was alive. So, for once, he decided to grant her wish - he buried her by the riverbank! When it rained, he worried constantly that the water would rise and the river would overflow its bank. Alas! One summer day during monsoon season, heavy rainfall lasted for several days and washed his mother's grave away. Poor Franky sat in the pouring rain by the riverbank, and cried and cried. And that's why, to this day, frogs croak when it rains. The moral of the story is to teach children to obey and respect their parents before it's too late.

children and went about her tasks happily–fetching water, gathering gabi
leaves, and digging camote for supper.
Once cloudy day, when the Sun was home, the Moon had to go to the river
for water. She crooned the children to sleep and called to her husband.
“Dear husband, I am going to fetch water. Watch over the children, but do
not go near them because you know what will happen if you do.” And after
the warning, she left.
The Sun looked lovingly at his children. He had never before been able to
really know them or even get near them. Overcome with love and affection,
he kissed them. To his horror, they shriveled up before his eyes and
crumbled to ashes.
His anguish was great. He moaned and cried. Suddenly he remembered
what her wife had told–not to touch the children! Not knowing what to do,
he hid in the forest.
Soon after this the Moon returned. A water jar was balanced on her head
and she carried a bundle of freshly cut gabi leaves in her arms. Laying down
the jar and leaves, she turned to look for her children. Wild was her grief to
find only ashes where her lovely brown babies had once been.
Her screams and lamentations reached her husband in the forest, and his
pity overcoming his fear, he went home. However, as soon as the Moon saw
him, her wailing became louder.
“My husband, why did you do it? Did I not tell you never to touch or even
draw near our children? Why did you disobey me?”
“I couldn’t help kissing them, O wife; they looked so sweet. I have never
seen anything so sweet before. Forgive me, O moon! Forgive me,” he
begged her.
But the Moon would not be comforted. Her reproaches increased in
intensity. In the end, the Sun got angry.
“Mang-ad!” he shouted. “Did you say that I disobeyed you? How dare you
think that you are superior to me, that you can order me what to do. Mang-
ad! Slave! How dare you say that I disobeyed you!”
“Ai!” she moaned. “I am nothing, nothing at all! Then, my children are
nothing too!” And with one defiant sweep of her arm, she scattered their
ashes to the four winds.
Horrified and enraged, the Sun seized the gabi leaves and threw them in his
wife’s face and dashed out of the house.
When he returned very late that night, his ill temper was gone. He regretted
having shouted at his wife. He found the house dark and empty. His wife
had fled, but pinpoints of glimmering light in the distance told him where
she was, for he knew the lights were his children following their mother in
her flight.
So started the endless cycle of the Sun chasing the Moon and the Moon
fleeing from the Sun. The Moon is forever with her children, the many tiny
lights we call stars. Now and then a shooting star breaks across the path of
the Moon. It is nothing more than an attempt from her husband to make
her and their two children return to him. But the Moon speeds away faster,
sometimes leaving the sky altogether, with only her star-babies there. This
happens when the marks of the gabi leaves on the Moon’s face swell, and
she remembers the pain and humiliation of her husband’s anger when he
threw the gabi leaves to her face and called her mang-ad (property) and
binotong (slave).

                            12. WHY DO FROGS CRY UNDER THE RAIN KOREAN FOLKTALE Long ago in a small pond, Franky, the green frog lived with his mother. He was a humppy little trop and his mother loved him very much. But he was a little green rebel who never obeyed her One morning his mother said, "Please yo catch some flies for dinner tonight "Instead, he len bome to play in the river with Todd, the turtle. "Honey, will you please go to the market for me?" his mother asked, "I need some lily pad flour 10 make biscuits." "No!" he cried, disrespectfully. Instead, he went out to the riverbank, rolled in the wet mud and covered his small green body with sticky black mud, On a hot June day, while babysitting the frog family's new tadpoles, he took the little ones out to the riverbank to play, even though his mother had asked him to stay with them in the pond while she was away And so it went, time and again Franky never followed his mother's requests. Of course, Franky's mother became very worried about his behavior. But no matter how hard she tried to teach him to be well behaved, it was to no avail. As the years went by, Franky grew into a handsome, strong, young bullfrog, while his mother was becoming older and weaker. Sadly, his disobedient attitude was still the same. Eventually, his mother became very sick and called him to her side to make one last request. "Please bury my body by the riverbank when I die,” she pleaded. She deliberately asked him to do so because she was certain that he would refuse to follow her instruction and do the opposite. It was be hope to be buried on the sunny side on the mountain plateau. Franky was very sad when his mother finally passed away. He deeply regretted that he never obeyed her and had not listened to her advice while she was alive. So, for once, he decided to grant her wish - he buried her by the riverbank! When it rained, he worried constantly that the water would rise and the river would overflow its bank. Alas! One summer day during monsoon season, heavy rainfall lasted for several days and washed his mother's grave away. Poor Franky sat in the pouring rain by the riverbank, and cried and cried. And that's why, to this day, frogs croak when it rains. The moral of the story is to teach children to obey and respect their parents before it's too late. In Korea, parents playfully tease disobedient children by calling them "green frogs.” 1. When did this story happen? 2. Where did the frogs live? 3. How many characters are present in the story? 4.

One day, it was announced to the feelings that the island would sink, so all constructed boats and left. Except for Love. Love was the only who stayed. Love wanted to hold out until the last possible moment. When the island almost sunk, Love decided to ask for help. (2.) Richness was passing by Love in a grand boat. Love said, "Richness, can you take me with you?' Richness answered, "No, I can't. there is a lot of gold and silver in my boat. There is no place for you here." (3.) Love decided to ask Vanity who was also passing by in a beautiful vessel. "Vanity, please help me.!" I can't help you Love. You are all wet and might damage my boat," Vanity answered. (4.) Sadness was close by so Love asked, "Sadness, let me go with you." "Oh... Love, I am so sad that I need to be by myself!" (5.) Happiness passed by Love, too, but she was so happy that she did not even hear when Love called her. Suddenly, there was a voice. "Come, Love, I will take you." It was an elder. So blessed and overjoyed, Love even forgot to ask the elder where they were going. Wh they arrived at dry land, the elder went her own way.

                            22. Why There is High Tide during a Full Moon
Long, long ago only gods lived in this world, the earth, seas, and sky were ruled by three different powerful gods.
The sun god, who ruled the sky, had a very beautiful daughter, Luna, the moon. Luna enjoyed going around the heavens in her golden chariot. One day she found herself taking another path which led her outside her kingdom. She wandered on until she reached the place where the sky met the sea. Beautiful and unusual sights greeted her eyes. As she was admiring the beautiful things around, a voice startled her. It asked, "Where has thou come from, most beautiful one?"
Turning around she saw a young man who looked much like her father though fairer. She wanted to run away, but when she looked at him again, she saw that he was smiling at her. Taking courage she answered, "I am Luna, daughter of the sun god."
The young man smiled at her and answered, "I am Mar, the son of the sea god. Welcome to our kingdom." Soon the two became good friends. They had many interesting stories to tell each other. When it was time for Luna to go, they promised to see each other as often as they could, for they has many more tales to tell. They continued meeting at the same spot until they realized that they were in love with each other.
One day after one of their secret meetings, Luna went back to the heavens full of joy. She was so happy that she told her secret to one of her cousins. The cousin, jealous of her beauty and her happiness, reported the affair to the sun god. The sun god was angered at his daughter's disobedience to the immortal laws. He shut her in their garden and did not allow her to get out. Then he sent a messenger to the sea god informing him that his son Mar disobeyed the immortal law. The sea god, who was also angered by his son's disobedience, imprisoned him in one of his sea caves.
Luna stayed in the garden for sometime. She was very sad at not being able to see Mar. She longed to be with him again. Feeling very restless one day, she escaped from the garden. She took her golden chariot and rushed to their meeting place. Mar, who was imprisoned in the sea cave, saw her reflection on the water. He wanted to get out to meet her. He tried hard to get out of his cave causing unrest in the sea. Luna waited for Mar to appear, but he did not come. Then she went back home very sad. Each time she remembered Mar, she would rush out in the golden chariot to the meeting place in hopes of seeing him again.
The fishermen out in the sea believe that each time Luna, the moon, appears, the sea gets troubled. "It is Mar trying to escape from his cave," they say.

 My Wonderful Weekend
On the weekend, my cousins came to stay from out of town. Their names are
Jeremy and Georgia. I love spending time with them.
Firstly, we went to the huge playground at the park near our house. Jeremy,
Georgia, and I pretended that we were fierce pirates. We felt so brave, bold, and
adventurous!
After that, we had a picnic lunch on the grass under the trees. We ate some
delicious sandwiches, fruit and cake. Jeremy loved the chocolate cake so much
that he ate three pieces!
Next, we all went to the cinema. My cousins and I felt overjoyed and very
excited about going to see a movie. It was scary and funny with a happy ending.
I loved spending the weekend with Jeremy and Georgia. I feel so lucky to have
such wonderful cousins. I hope they can come and stay at my house again very
soon.

One night, she asked her father if she could go with them. "Who will be left here to stay with your mother? "her father asked. Without a word, she nodded and went inside her room. After few minutes, her mother asked, do you really want to go with your father tonight?" She looked at her mother with a smile. She ran fast to her room and shouted, "Thank you mother! They headed when everything was ready. To Zeah's surprised that her mother is going with them she couldn't help singing until everybody was singing. "Que Sera, Sera." "What will be, will be." They laughed at each other. Her father said, "We will do it always.". "We are very busy tending our own chores and forget to express how important each other is in building a very good home.".
