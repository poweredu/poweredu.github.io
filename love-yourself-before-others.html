                                            Hi, I know you are tired. We are same but let's keep on fighting! remember that it's for our future, family, and dream in life. Once you feel it's time to give up, always think about other students, teachers, your parents who's tired also but didn't give up. They do everything to be a good influence on you. So, you also need to do everything to be a good influence to others. We need to study hard, always remember that you are the best the way you are and you are better than you are before. Don't compare yourself to others and be you. Love studies to have a nice future!! Saying this to all of you because I want you guys to fight for yourself and everything/everyone you love. Keep on shining, you are a star. Once you love yourself and you already reach your dream, you will shine brighter than the star. You will be the Sun who will be good influence to others.Continue to help each other but remember and study the answers that from them to understand it well. Fighting everyone!​</a>

                                            6 NON- SEXUAL ADVICE FOR YOUNGSTERS
Do not spend so much time trying to be more physically attractive in order to just impress your crush rather than making yourself mentally attractive.
Educate yourself , address your reccuring toxic thoughts , deal with your insecurities and learn to be happy on your own.
That's attractive.
Normalize saying "No" without needing to over explain yourself. 
If someone is offended by your boundaries , that's their problem.
The best weight you'll ever lose is the weight of other people's opinion of you.
Don't subscribe to other people's definition of "FUN".
Fun doesn't have to mean drinking , partying and socialising.
Fun can be a night in alone , getting lost in a book , a deep conversation , a walk, creating art , playing music , or doing your work. 
FUN IS YOURS ; YOU DEFINE IT.
Before you get married 
discuss bills , parenting styles , credit , debt , how to deal with family , what belief will be installed in your children , childhood traumas , sexual expectations , partner expectations , financial expectations , family health history , bucket list , dream home , career and education , political view and whatever else come in mind. 
LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH.
The age of 15-30 is golden era of your life. 
You make friends , lose them too.
You fall , you fail , you learn , you realise , you hit reality , you fall in love , you get hurt too. You lose yourself and eventually become stronger. 
Remember!
These are the best years of your life.
You should understand the difference between enjoying it and ruining it. 
Heal before having children so your children don't have to heal from having you as a parent.</a>

Store up treasure for yourself with God, where no moth or rust can destroy, nor thief come and steal it. B. No one can serve two masters; for he will either hate one and love the other, or he will be loyal to the first and look down on the second. You cannot at the same time serve God and money. C. This is why I tell you not to be worried about food and drink for yourself or about clothes for your body. Is not life more important than food and is not the body more important than clothes? D. Fortunate you are, when people insult you and persecute you and speak all kinds of evil against you because you are my followers. Be glad and joyful, for a great reward is kept for you in God. This is how these people persecuted the prophets who lived before you. E. Set your heart first on the kingdom and justice of God and all these things will be given to you. ​</a>

                                            Some “One” Dear
You learned from the previous text that Self is a “Reflective Project”. We do
reflective assessment, and we keep on trying to change ourselves for what we think
is the best. Big part of the reflecting process are considerations like how you think
people perceive you. However, sometimes you could get so caught up with a lot
of things that you tend to fail to formally project yourself to others.
This activity will open the chance for you to tell everything that you want to
say to a person dear to you. You are tasked to create a letter for someone that matters
to you. Share all your learnings, your discovered characteristics, habits, and
experiences that you failed to tell him/her before.

                                            Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</a>

                            6. 6 NON- SEXUAL ADVICE FOR YOUNGSTERS
Do not spend so much time trying to be more physically attractive in order to just impress your crush rather than making yourself mentally attractive.
Educate yourself , address your reccuring toxic thoughts , deal with your insecurities and learn to be happy on your own.
That's attractive.
Normalize saying "No" without needing to over explain yourself. 
If someone is offended by your boundaries , that's their problem.
The best weight you'll ever lose is the weight of other people's opinion of you.
Don't subscribe to other people's definition of "FUN".
Fun doesn't have to mean drinking , partying and socialising.
Fun can be a night in alone , getting lost in a book , a deep conversation , a walk, creating art , playing music , or doing your work. 
FUN IS YOURS ; YOU DEFINE IT.
Before you get married 
discuss bills , parenting styles , credit , debt , how to deal with family , what belief will be installed in your children , childhood traumas , sexual expectations , partner expectations , financial expectations , family health history , bucket list , dream home , career and education , political view and whatever else come in mind. 
LOVE IS NOT ENOUGH.
The age of 15-30 is golden era of your life. 
You make friends , lose them too.
You fall , you fail , you learn , you realise , you hit reality , you fall in love , you get hurt too. You lose yourself and eventually become stronger. 
Remember!
These are the best years of your life.
You should understand the difference between enjoying it and ruining it. 
Heal before having children so your children don't have to heal from having you as a parent.</h2><br />

Store up treasure for yourself with God, where no moth or rust can destroy, nor thief come and steal it. B. No one can serve two masters; for he will either hate one and love the other, or he will be loyal to the first and look down on the second. You cannot at the same time serve God and money. C. This is why I tell you not to be worried about food and drink for yourself or about clothes for your body. Is not life more important than food and is not the body more important than clothes? D.

</p>Speech Styles
<p>According to Martin Joos (1976; 156) speech style refers to the speaker's use of language, which is defined by the degree of formality.
</p><p>
</p>Types of Communicative Styles
<strong>Intimate: </strong>This is a private style that is used by intimate family members or individuals. For instance, a talk between a husband and wife, a boyfriend and a girlfriend, a conversation between close siblings, a parent and a child, or a conversation between close friends.  <strong>Casual:</strong> Friends, peers, colleagues, or family members who have a shared knowledge or interest use it in casual or relaxed interactions. Conversations among friends, classmates, colleagues, peers, and family members, for example.
<strong>Formal: </strong>A type of oral presentation or paper that is meant to impart information and follows established professional regulations, standards, and processes while avoiding the use of slang terms. Sermons, rhetorical comments and inquiries, speeches, judicial declarations, and announcements are only a few examples.
<strong>Consultative: </strong>It's usually a dialogue, but it's formal enough that the words are carefully picked.  <strong>Frozen:</strong> Fixed speech is another name for it. It is the most formal communicating style, and it is frequently utilized in formal situations or ceremonies. Pledge of Allegiance, Lord's Prayer, national song, national pledge, and school creeds are just a few examples.

                            26. Some “One” Dear
You learned from the previous text that Self is a “Reflective Project”. We do
reflective assessment, and we keep on trying to change ourselves for what we think
is the best. Big part of the reflecting process are considerations like how you think
people perceive you. However, sometimes you could get so caught up with a lot
of things that you tend to fail to formally project yourself to others.
This activity will open the chance for you to tell everything that you want to
say to a person dear to you. You are tasked to create a letter for someone that matters
to you. Share all your learnings, your discovered characteristics, habits, and
experiences that you failed to tell him/her before.

                            28. Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</h2><br />
