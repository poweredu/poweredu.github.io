Textual aids are text features that can be present not only in the books, magazines, or other reading materials, but also in any places in the community just like in the streets, in the markets, and other public spots. You already know its help when it comes to understanding a certain concept on the book. Besides that, how do you think will it help you in your actual daily living and activities in the community? Cite examples to justify your answer.</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Textual aid not only helps us in academic problems but also in daily life. Examples of textual aid are the directions in the street, the signboard, the name of the store, the name of restaurant that you want to dine in, and many more. Textual aid helps us to understand what to do or to know where we should go. For instance, you wish to cross the street, there's a signboard that says it's not the pedestrian lane but you crossed anyway, then got hit by a car. So, without understanding textual aid there are risks but if you do, it should be an advantage in your being.</p><br />
