                                            I.  Modified True or False.  Write TRUE  if the statement is true.   If the statement is FALSE, underline only the word in the statement that makes it false and write the correct answer in the blank  (2 points each item).Example:           Mindanao 1.  Davao City is in Luzon.__________1. Literatures are works that express ideas of permanent or temporal interest, in forms of fiction and non-fiction, or prose and poetry.____________2. Non-fiction is a form of literature that follows the structure of natural speech, with fully formed sentences and paragraphs.____________3. When the work is analyzed with methods influenced by Freud’s psychoanalysis, it is called Freudian’s Criticism.___________4. In sociological criticism, the text is examined with how societal elements are represented in the work.   An influential type of this is gender criticism.___________5. Prose is a form of literature where words are arranged artistically, typically with attention to rhyme, rhythm, and symbolism.___________6.  Fiction are works that are imaginary in terms of characters, settings, event, and other elements.___________7.  In the deconstructionist criticism, the work is examined with a focus on how the meaning is used in the text, not on what is said.________ 8.  The assumption that language can accurately represent reality is rejected by the formalist criticism._________9.  The Reader-Response Criticism focuses on finding meaning in the  act of living itself and examining how individual readers or communities experience a literary text.__________10.  Reading is the argumentation and analysis of literary text through different views that focus on the text’s purposes, principles, and perspectives.__________11. Non-fiction are works that are presented as historical and personal truths.__________12.  Audience are the receivers of the text, as in, the individual or group that reads and responds to the message of the material.__________ 13.  Literary text as a whole can be seen in different ways; there are various ways to analyze and write the text.____________ 14. Formalist Criticism is taken as a form of pattern that needs to be examined on its own, with all the necessary elements for understanding the text that are contained within the text itself.____________ 15. Gender Criticism analyzes the work with how sexual identity influenced the creation and reception of the text, most notably through a humanistic lens.____________ 16.  The Reader-Response Criticism treats the work to contain no meaning unless a reader derives meaning from it, with the fundamental idea that literature is a transaction between the author and the mind of the audience.____________17. Sexual identity and our professional background also color our worldview.____________ 18.  Text is a piece of literary work that does not have to be written.____________ 19.   Works that express ideas in forms of fiction and non-fiction, or prose and poetry may include non-authored forms as well.___________20.  Works that are imaginary in terms of characters, settings, events, and other elements are considered as poetry.II.  Extended Prose.  Answer each question in not more than THREE (3) sentences (5 pts. each item).A.  Why does reading a story again in later life yield a different response compared to that when the story was first read as a child?B.  A weakness of the Reader- Response Criticism is the tendency for the reader to write whatever he or she wants as long as it is personal.  How could this be addressed so the reader can present a valid criticism?​</a>
