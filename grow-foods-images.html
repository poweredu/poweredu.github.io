This can result in highly elevated blood sugar levels.</p><p></p><p>Too much sugar in your blood is extremely taxing on the kidneys, which work to process that sugar. When the kidneys aren’t up to the job, much of that glucose is eliminated from the body through your urine.</p><p></p><p>This process also flushes out valuable hydrating fluids from your body, often leaving people with diabetes peeing frequently as well as dehydrated.</p><p></p><p>Early on, you may not even notice that you’re urinating more often than normal. One of the key warning signs, however, should be if frequent urination starts to wake you up from sleep and deplete your energy levels.</p><p></p><p>How to know if it’s diabetes</p><p>Peeing a lot is a hallmark sign of both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes, as the elimination of bodily fluids is sometimes your body’s only way of flushing excess blood sugar.</p><p></p><p>But urinating more than usual is just one of many signs and can be caused by any number of health conditions. If you’re worried about diabetes, it’s important to look out for some of these other common diabetes symptoms:</p><p></p><p>Fatigue. The cells’ inability to draw on glucose for energy can leave people with diabetes feeling depleted and exhausted much of the time. Dehydration only makes the fatigue worse.</p><p>Weight loss. A combination of low insulin levels and an inability to absorb sugar from the blood can lead to rapid weight loss in people with diabetes.</p><p>Blurred vision. A side effect of the dehydration caused by diabetes can be a severe drying of the eyes, which may affect vision.</p><p>Swollen gums. Those with diabetes are at higher risk for infections, swelling, or buildup of pus in the gums.</p><p>Tingling. A loss in sensation in the limbs, fingers, or toes is a common side effect of excess blood sugar.</p><p>If you’re frequently urinating and worry it might be diabetes, keep an eye out for some of these other classic symptoms. If you notice several of them, or just want to be sure, consult a doctor.</p><br />

A. function and structure
D. experimentation and observation
C. I and II
D. reforestation
D. all choices are correct<p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>
Through the years, organisms on earth would be subjected to changes because they are trying to adapt to their environment. These changes would become drastic as their lineage gap increases in size.
