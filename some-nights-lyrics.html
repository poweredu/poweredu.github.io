                        <strong>A MILLION DREAMS </strong><p>a. I think the singer saw that he sees a <strong>world </strong>where he can all his aspirations and hopes in life.He imagines a <strong>world</strong> in which he is free, contented, and surrounded by those he loves. He visualizes a world in which anything is possible and he may fully live his life. In other words, he sees a multitude of dreams that are all within his reach.</p><strong>b.Brightest colors mean</strong>The lyrics "Every night I lie in bed, the brightest colors fill my head" from the song "A Million Dreams" perhaps refer to the vivid and lively dreams that the singer has at night. The boldest colors can represent the singer's enthusiasm and hope for his goals and desires. It might also be a symbol for his desire to escape his existing situation and the routine of his everyday existence. The use of vivid colors in this line inspires amazement and imagination, indicating that the singer's visions are rich with potential and possibilities.c.Dark in the song representsThe singer's struggles and difficulties in life are perhaps represented by the "black" in the song. His dreams and reality are at odds with each other because of the difference between the "brightest colors" that fill his thoughts at night and the blackness that he experiences during the day. The darkness can stand in for the challenges he must face in order to realize his goals, such as poverty, social constraints, or anxieties about himself. The song emphasizes the capacity of optimism and imagination to overcome challenging circumstances and forge a better future by contrasting the darkness with the vivid colors of his dreams.d.Issues/Fears about life that the speaker confronting in the songThe song conveys a message of optimism and tenacity in the face of adversity while capturing the hardships and fears that many people experience when attempting to realize their aspirations.In the song some issues that confront the speaker are the fear of failure, poverty, social barriers and loneliness.E. Attitude/characteristic the singer showThe attitude/ characteristics the singer show is hopeful and optimistic attitude that despite of the challenges in life and fears he faces. the singer still embodies a positive and proactive attitude towards life. The singer is not contented with his current circumstances  and is willing to take risk and make changes to create a better future himself.f. Importance to have dreamsCertainly, having dreams in life is vital because they provide us hope, purpose, and inspiration. Dreams motivate us to follow our passions, face obstacles head-on, and realize our greatest potential.g. Actions to reach my dreamsTo pursue my dreams in life the following are the steps that I take: First, I will accept the other people negative opinion as a truth. I would make an effort to alter my viewpoint and see their remark as a challenge to disprove them.I will evaluate my goals in life, I will seek feedback from the people I trust.I will focus on self improvement  and surround myself with positive influences.h. Interpreting the songThe song "A Million Dreams" is about the ability of hope and creativity to get through challenging situations and accomplish one's goals. Despite difficulties including poverty and social restrictions, the singer—a young boy—dreams of a better life that is vibrant and exciting. The song exhorts listeners to hold on to their hopes and to trust in the ability of hope and imagination to change the world and build a better future.2. Lecture on how to interpret a songThere are a few important factors to take into account when figuring out what a song's message is. The first is the song's context. At the time the song was composed, what was going on in the world or the artist's life? This can offer crucial hints about what the song may be about.The definitions of the words used in the lyrics should then be viewed. Understanding the intended meaning of words is crucial because sometimes the artist will use them in a non-literal manner.It is important to consider the main themes and interests of the song, as well as the message the artist is trying to convey and any recurring patterns or themes. Once these elements have been taken into account, one can start to develop an interpretation of the song. This could involve looking at the lyrics from a broad perspective to identify any underlying themes or messages, or examining the music itself to see how the melody and instrumentation contribute to the overall mood and atmosphere of the song.3.
