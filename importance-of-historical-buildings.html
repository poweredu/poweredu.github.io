Read the article below about Naguib Mahfouz. As you read, look for the cohesive devices used and list them. Write your answers in your notebook. Naguib Mahfouz's first nine or ten years spent in the old Gamaliya quarters in Cairo plays an important role in his earlier, realistic novels like "Midaq Alley" and "The Cairo Trilogy." This alley of his childhood is a small-scale version of Egyptian society in his works. The family house seems to have inspired Mahfouz and serves as the model for the Abd al-Jawad family house in "The Cairo Trilogy" during that time. The Revolution in 1919 also had a nationalist effect on his writings that he expressed his criticisms through them. In 1920, he published his "The Cairo Trilogy" when his family moved to a new suburban district called Abbasiya. Mahfouz began writing when he was in primary school. He was then a fan of detective, historical, and adventure novels. He continued writing fiction in secondary school with Arabic fiction innovators, Taha Hussein and Ibrahim al-Mazini, as his models for the short story. Mahfouz's forty or so articles were published in various magazines and newspapers; most of which dealt with philosophical and psychological issues. Among his favorite writers were Shakespeare, Conrad, Melville, Flaubert, Stendhal, Tolstoy, Proust, O'Neill, Shaw, Ibsen, and Strindberg. He published his first novel, "Khufu's Wisdom" in 1939, and wrote 35 more novels, 15 collections of short stories, as well as "Echoes of an Autobiography" in 1994. He worked on some 25 film screenplays from the late 1940s to 1980s. This activity influenced the use of devices like montage and flashback in his prose writings. More than 30 Egyptian films have been based on Mahfouz's novels and short stories. His own books, however, have been adapted for screen not by him, but by others. Mahfouz received the Egyptian State Prize twice for his writings. In 1988, he got the Nobel Prize for Literature.​</a>

Shelly Smith, NYPL's Head of Conservation Treatment, shares tips on how to keep your treasured books in shape.Learn more about NYPL's Preservation DivisionShelly SmithShelly SmithDOsDO keep your books in a stable, moderate environment.  A good rule of thumb is that if you’re comfortable, so are your books.  Room temperature, around 70 degrees (though even cooler is better), and a moderate stable relative humidity (around 40-50%) is best.  Too much heat or moisture can speed up deterioration or encourage mold growth.  Try not to store your books in attics, which can become too hot, or basements, which can become too moist.DO keep your books away from direct sunlight and other high intensity light.  Ultraviolet and visible light can speed up the deterioration of paper and cause fading or discoloration of the vibrant colors of book covers or dust jackets.DO clean your books regularly by dusting.  Simply hold the book closed and wipe the covers and edges with a plain soft cloth.  Vacuuming books with a soft brush attachment can also safely remove loose dust.DO shelve your books upright, and support them with bookends so they won’t slump or become misshapen.  If you have oversize or large, heavy volumes that don’t fit upright on the shelf, store them flat rather than on their spine or fore edge (side opposite spine).DO hire a qualified conservator to repair your important or valuable volumes.  A good resource is the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC).  Its web page has excellent information about what to expect from a conservator and how to find one in your area.  AIC also has a referral service that can help you find conservators in your area.DON'TsDON’T put your bookshelves along exterior walls, where they may experience more temperature and humidity changes.  Try to place them along interior walls.DON’T repair damaged covers or paper with pressure-sensitive adhesive tape (the type of tape readily available in office supply, craft, and drug stores).  Often this type of repair, done with even the best of intentions, can cause more damage over time.DON’T use oil or leather dressing on your leather bindings.  Contrary to previously held opinion, oil or leather dressing doesn’t keep leather supple, and it can actually cause deterioration to the volume as the oil or leather dressing ages.  Simply wiping leather bindings with a plain soft cloth is best.DON’T pull on the top of the spine when removing books from shelves. This can cause the top of the book’s spine to break and detach over time. Instead, push back books on either side and grasp the volume you want to remove at the middle of the spine and pull to remove from the shelf.DON’T use self-stick notes, paper clips or rubber bands.  Self-stick notes leave a sticky residue that is not good for paper. Paper clips can rust over time and rubber bands can tear pages or, as they decay, even stick to the book.  Instead, use a slip of acid-free paper as a bookmark.AccessibilityPressCareersSpace RentalPrivacy PolicyOther PoliciesTerms &amp; ConditionsGovernanceRules &amp; RegulationsAbout NYPLLanguageNYPL Main Building Facade© The New York Public Library, 2021The New York Public Library is a 501(c)(3) | EIN 13-1887440​</a>

                            11. Build Your Style Language Workshop: Using Cohesive Devices Cohesive devices are words or phrases that connect the ideas in your sentences or paragraphs. Read the article below about Naguib Mahfouz. As you read, look for the cohesive devices used and list them. Write your answers in your notebook. Naguib Mahfouz's first nine or ten years spent in the old Gamaliya quarters in Cairo plays an important role in his earlier, realistic novels like "Midaq Alley" and "The Cairo Trilogy." This alley of his childhood is a small-scale version of Egyptian society in his works. The family house seems to have inspired Mahfouz and serves as the model for the Abd al-Jawad family house in "The Cairo Trilogy" during that time. The Revolution in 1919 also had a nationalist effect on his writings that he expressed his criticisms through them. In 1920, he published his "The Cairo Trilogy" when his family moved to a new suburban district called Abbasiya. Mahfouz began writing when he was in primary school. He was then a fan of detective, historical, and adventure novels. He continued writing fiction in secondary school with Arabic fiction innovators, Taha Hussein and Ibrahim al-Mazini, as his models for the short story. Mahfouz's forty or so articles were published in various magazines and newspapers; most of which dealt with philosophical and psychological issues. Among his favorite writers were Shakespeare, Conrad, Melville, Flaubert, Stendhal, Tolstoy, Proust, O'Neill, Shaw, Ibsen, and Strindberg. He published his first novel, "Khufu's Wisdom" in 1939, and wrote 35 more novels, 15 collections of short stories, as well as "Echoes of an Autobiography" in 1994. He worked on some 25 film screenplays from the late 1940s to 1980s. This activity influenced the use of devices like montage and flashback in his prose writings. More than 30 Egyptian films have been based on Mahfouz's novels and short stories. His own books, however, have been adapted for screen not by him, but by others. Mahfouz received the Egyptian State Prize twice for his writings. In 1988, he got the Nobel Prize for Literature.​</h2><br />

Shelly Smith, NYPL's Head of Conservation Treatment, shares tips on how to keep your treasured books in shape.Learn more about NYPL's Preservation DivisionShelly SmithShelly SmithDOsDO keep your books in a stable, moderate environment.  A good rule of thumb is that if you’re comfortable, so are your books.  Room temperature, around 70 degrees (though even cooler is better), and a moderate stable relative humidity (around 40-50%) is best.  Too much heat or moisture can speed up deterioration or encourage mold growth.  Try not to store your books in attics, which can become too hot, or basements, which can become too moist.DO keep your books away from direct sunlight and other high intensity light.  Ultraviolet and visible light can speed up the deterioration of paper and cause fading or discoloration of the vibrant colors of book covers or dust jackets.DO clean your books regularly by dusting.  Simply hold the book closed and wipe the covers and edges with a plain soft cloth.  Vacuuming books with a soft brush attachment can also safely remove loose dust.DO shelve your books upright, and support them with bookends so they won’t slump or become misshapen.  If you have oversize or large, heavy volumes that don’t fit upright on the shelf, store them flat rather than on their spine or fore edge (side opposite spine).DO hire a qualified conservator to repair your important or valuable volumes.  A good resource is the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works (AIC).  Its web page has excellent information about what to expect from a conservator and how to find one in your area.  AIC also has a referral service that can help you find conservators in your area.DON'TsDON’T put your bookshelves along exterior walls, where they may experience more temperature and humidity changes.  Try to place them along interior walls.DON’T repair damaged covers or paper with pressure-sensitive adhesive tape (the type of tape readily available in office supply, craft, and drug stores).  Often this type of repair, done with even the best of intentions, can cause more damage over time.DON’T use oil or leather dressing on your leather bindings.  Contrary to previously held opinion, oil or leather dressing doesn’t keep leather supple, and it can actually cause deterioration to the volume as the oil or leather dressing ages.  Simply wiping leather bindings with a plain soft cloth is best.DON’T pull on the top of the spine when removing books from shelves. This can cause the top of the book’s spine to break and detach over time. Instead, push back books on either side and grasp the volume you want to remove at the middle of the spine and pull to remove from the shelf.DON’T use self-stick notes, paper clips or rubber bands.  Self-stick notes leave a sticky residue that is not good for paper. Paper clips can rust over time and rubber bands can tear pages or, as they decay, even stick to the book.  Instead, use a slip of acid-free paper as a bookmark.AccessibilityPressCareersSpace RentalPrivacy PolicyOther PoliciesTerms &amp; ConditionsGovernanceRules &amp; RegulationsAbout NYPLLanguageNYPL Main Building Facade© The New York Public Library, 2021The New York Public Library is a 501(c)(3) | EIN 13-1887440​</h2><br />
