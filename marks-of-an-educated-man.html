The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</a>

                            1. what are the vocabulary words in the the marks of an educated man third trait by Nicholas Murray Butler ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>There are many educated men on the face of the Earth while some are not so educated. In his essay “The Marks of an Educated Man”, Butler listed five traits of an educated man: correctness and precision in the mother tongue, gentle manners, power and habit of reflection, power of growth, and his possession of efficiency/power to do so. The definition of an educated man in Butler’s definition is indeed correct. You cannot say you met one educated man that lacks all 5 of the traits that he had listed above.</p><p></p><p>To begin with, I agree with Butler’s definition of an educated man because all the qualities that he listed are truly found in an educated man. The first trait that he had stated was correctness and precision in the mother tongue. What this basically means is that an educated man uses correct language and pronunciation in his speech on a day to day basis. In the text Butler states “When one hears English well spoken with pure diction, correct pronunciation and almost unconscious choice of the right words, he or she recognizes it at once.” (page 1, paragraph 2, lines 15-17). What Butler is saying is that if a man can speaks English clearly and properly, therefore he is educated. People of this generation cannot put a sentence together without using 2 negatives or a curse word after every word that they say. An educated man pronounces his word thoroughly and clearly so anyone and everyone can understand what they are saying.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><strong>#</strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>i</strong><strong>n</strong><strong>g</strong><br />
