Beyond resilience, adaptability, and having the courage to face very difficult times, we Filipinos have shown that we are also compassionate, selflessly eager, and always ready to help anybody in need.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What is your motivation for choosing your ethnic group?</strong></p><p><strong>- It has an important social function and fosters feelings of group identity and solidarity. It is the means by which culture and its traditions and shared values may be conveyed and preserved.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What makes your ethnic group unique?</strong></p><p><strong>- Filipinos are known for having strong and close family ties. They place high regard and put importance on their family before anything else. They work all day and do all they can to feed and provide for their family. In other countries, when a person turned 18, he/she can live away from his/her family. Having Close Family Ties is one of their unique traits. It is one of the outstanding cultural values that Filipinos have. The family takes care of each other and is taught to be loyal to family and elders by simply obeying their authorities. This is one of the unique characteristics of Filipinos</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>What would you modify if you were to conduct the study again?​</strong></p><p><strong>- I would like to interview some Filipinos about their family.</strong></p><br />
