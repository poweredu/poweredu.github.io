                                            True or False
The need for cultural awareness is a major impact of globalization on the required skillset of effective communicators.
Virtual interactions have always been an important factor of success in business.
In a globalized world, effective communication is a necessity.
The first step in achieving effective communication is to know your location.
Globalization has introduced virtual communication and collaboration as a major part of workplace dynamics.
Awareness of communication differences in a body language can be just as important as the nuances of speech.
Conceptually, “communication” is another way of describing the technological space at the interface of economic globalization and cultural globalization.
The global policy framework for communication is therefore emerging as a key structural component of the emerging global governance framework in general.
Communicating with your customers, your suppliers, your stockholders, and many other stakeholders all factor into the global equation.
Ancient entrepreneurs need to understand the strengths and limitations of different communications media, and how to use each medium to maximum effect.
People who are accustomed to communicating in groups in virtual settings can find themselves lost, confused or unable to share their input.
Even when two people are speaking the same language, cultural differences can affect vocabulary, colloquial expressions, voice tone and taboo topics.
Affecting the true meaning of global communications would be the intercultural factor.
Global Communication is not only the interaction between two employees within your organization.</a>

                                            Aside from the spread of the infectious disease and the struggle to contain it, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic has created far-reaching implications, including economic, social, and cultural consequences. The said disease is anticipated to automatically affect the Philippine economy and the global economy as well, since deceleration or slowdown in economic activities, which is an infection control practice, is inevitably needed in preventing and reducing the transmission of the disease from one person to another. Decrease in tourist arrivals because of travel restrictions, sharp decline in remittances, increase in business closures, and rise in the unemployment rate are some of the expected economic impacts of the pandemic.Apart from the economic sectors, this infectious disease has also affected the different social institutions, such as education and family. Widespread closures of educational institutions and utilization of distance education instead of face-to-face learning are a few implications of the pandemic in the educational system. Also, people, especially women and children, have become more vulnerable to the different types of domestic and sexual violence because of community quarantine, which is sad, thinking that it should be safer for them to stay at home with their family. According to the Philippine National Police's - Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC), 602 cases of sexual assault, or an average of eight incidents a day, were recorded from March 17, 2020 to May 23, 2020. These were the times when Luzon and other parts of the Philippines were under enhanced community quarantine because of the pandemic. Religion is another social institution that is impacted by the pandemic. Sunday schools or church schools were closed, worship services of various religious institutions were cancelled, and even pilgrimages, or visitations to the places that are considered holy or special, were also cancelled.Because of these consequences brought by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, our world and our everyday lives will never go back to normal for a long period of time. Whether we like it or not, we must adapt the routines and restrictions of the “new normal,” such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, and changing our lifestyles, so that we can prevent the spread of the infectious disease and ensure not just our own safety, but the safety of all. Fortunately, various disciplines of Social Sciences can help us adjust to the “new normal.” These disciplines can help in the battle against the pandemic byinvestigating the different social forces related to the development and transmission of this infectious disease. Moreover, Social Science disciplines can produce knowledge that can be employed in helping individuals, families, and communities on how to better cope with the implications of the pandemic. Now, the question is: What are the different disciplines under the Social Sciences?Pahelp sana may matinong sumagot​</a>

                            3. True or False
The need for cultural awareness is a major impact of globalization on the required skillset of effective communicators.
Virtual interactions have always been an important factor of success in business.
In a globalized world, effective communication is a necessity.
The first step in achieving effective communication is to know your location.
Globalization has introduced virtual communication and collaboration as a major part of workplace dynamics.
Awareness of communication differences in a body language can be just as important as the nuances of speech.
Conceptually, “communication” is another way of describing the technological space at the interface of economic globalization and cultural globalization.
The global policy framework for communication is therefore emerging as a key structural component of the emerging global governance framework in general.
Communicating with your customers, your suppliers, your stockholders, and many other stakeholders all factor into the global equation.
Ancient entrepreneurs need to understand the strengths and limitations of different communications media, and how to use each medium to maximum effect.
People who are accustomed to communicating in groups in virtual settings can find themselves lost, confused or unable to share their input.
Even when two people are speaking the same language, cultural differences can affect vocabulary, colloquial expressions, voice tone and taboo topics.
Affecting the true meaning of global communications would be the intercultural factor.
Global Communication is not only the interaction between two employees within your organization.</h2><br />

                            9. Aside from the spread of the infectious disease and the struggle to contain it, Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic has created far-reaching implications, including economic, social, and cultural consequences. The said disease is anticipated to automatically affect the Philippine economy and the global economy as well, since deceleration or slowdown in economic activities, which is an infection control practice, is inevitably needed in preventing and reducing the transmission of the disease from one person to another. Decrease in tourist arrivals because of travel restrictions, sharp decline in remittances, increase in business closures, and rise in the unemployment rate are some of the expected economic impacts of the pandemic.Apart from the economic sectors, this infectious disease has also affected the different social institutions, such as education and family. Widespread closures of educational institutions and utilization of distance education instead of face-to-face learning are a few implications of the pandemic in the educational system. Also, people, especially women and children, have become more vulnerable to the different types of domestic and sexual violence because of community quarantine, which is sad, thinking that it should be safer for them to stay at home with their family. According to the Philippine National Police's - Women and Children Protection Center (PNP-WCPC), 602 cases of sexual assault, or an average of eight incidents a day, were recorded from March 17, 2020 to May 23, 2020. These were the times when Luzon and other parts of the Philippines were under enhanced community quarantine because of the pandemic. Religion is another social institution that is impacted by the pandemic. Sunday schools or church schools were closed, worship services of various religious institutions were cancelled, and even pilgrimages, or visitations to the places that are considered holy or special, were also cancelled.Because of these consequences brought by the Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) Pandemic, our world and our everyday lives will never go back to normal for a long period of time. Whether we like it or not, we must adapt the routines and restrictions of the “new normal,” such as wearing face masks, practicing social distancing, and changing our lifestyles, so that we can prevent the spread of the infectious disease and ensure not just our own safety, but the safety of all. Fortunately, various disciplines of Social Sciences can help us adjust to the “new normal.” These disciplines can help in the battle against the pandemic byinvestigating the different social forces related to the development and transmission of this infectious disease. Moreover, Social Science disciplines can produce knowledge that can be employed in helping individuals, families, and communities on how to better cope with the implications of the pandemic. Now, the question is: What are the different disciplines under the Social Sciences?Pahelp sana may matinong sumagot​</h2><br />
