                                            The study was conducted in the general area of Tablas Strait, in Mansalay Bay, on the island of Mindoro, central Philippines . The study site has a multispecies seagrass area starting at the intertidal zone to a depth of 1 meter. Between 1.5 to 2 meters in depth, coral bommies occur. Sand and rubble area with sporadic Halophila patches are found at 2–10-meter depths. The population survey was done for eight consecutive quarters starting in September 2011. A systematic search of aggregations was done by deploying an imaginary transect belt with a 20-meter width. A paddle boat was rowed, and made a survey stop every 50-meter distance. Aggregations were searched within a 20-meters radius of the boat. The search was aided by local fishermen who are used to looking for visual signs of aggregations from water surface down to 10-meters depth. As a preliminary to establishing the species' age frequency data, an investigation of whether shape changes with age was conducted. A total of 256 individuals were collected by hand randomly from the observed aggregations to serve as test organisms. Animals were boiled to facilitate the cleaning of the shells. An a-priori aging was done based on the length and lip thickness (Poiner and Catterall 1988; Catterall et al. 2001): &lt; 10 mm length are early recruits; 20–30 mm length with &lt; 2 mm lip thickness are yearlings; 30–40 mm length with &lt; 2 mm lip thickness are young adults; 30–45 mm length with 2.1-3.9 mm lip thickness as adults; and 30–45 mm length with &gt; 4 mm lip thickness as mature adults. The shells were later photographed laying on their adaxial side using a Canon S95 digital camera with grid settings to assist in focusing on the image. Positioning was made constant by making the suture between the lip and the body whorl constantly visible on the image and the central portion of the shell filling the center quadrat of the camera grid. This was facilitated by setting the shell on clay dough to prevent toppling. Acquired images were edited using Microsoft® Office Picture Manager retaining 1-centimeter space around each image. Ten (10) landmarks and 29 semi-landmarks were digitized along the surface of the captured images using tpsDig by Rohlf (2005)are specific features that can easily be located, such as tips, maximum curvatures, and sutures, while semi-landmarks are points with relative positions from a landmark or along a surface (Zelditch et al. 2004). The acquired spatial points were converted into coordinates by tpsRelW (Rohlf 2003), which allowed data processing as shape variables. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was done in MorphoJ (Klininger 2011) to determine possible age differences. Finally, the maximization of group separation was done with Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA). All individuals from observed aggregations were photographed on their adaxial side in situ. Shells heavily encrusted with algae were lightly cleaned to expose the shell outline. Photos were processed using the same methodologies done on test organisms. A total of 3,624 individuals were used for this study. Using the values from the CVA of the test organisms, Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) in R (R Core Team 2016) was applied to age sample individuals to derive the age frequency distribution. Then, the derived age frequency data were used to compute growth parameters, mortality rates, recruitment patterns, exploitation rate, and yield per recruit using FiSAT (FAO-ICLAM Assessment Tool) package (Gayanilo et al. 2005). Growth was assumed to be described by von Bertalanffy equation which had been proven to apply to bivalves and other gastropods (Dolorosa and Dangan-Galon 2014; del NorteCampos and Villarta 2010; Al-Barwani et al. 2007; Cob et al. 2009; Tumanda et al. 1997). The estimated maximum size when species is not caught (L∞), as well as the constant growth rate (K), was initially estimated by scanning for possible values given the age-frequency distribution using Elefan I in FISAT (Tumanda et al. 1997; Cob et al. 2008; Dolorosa and Dangan-Galon 2014). The values were confirmed with the subsequent fitting of derived age-frequency values where the Rn-value is the highest. Subsequently, the best combination of L∞ and K was taken using the Powell-Wetherall plot to take the proportion of total mortality (Z) and the growth rate (K). The K-value was taken as an approximation of the natural mortality (M) value which applies to exploited stocks that make a collection of natural mortality data impossible (Tumanda et al. 1997). For this approximation, the second point representing the yearling group (Age 1) was assumed to be fully recruited to the fishery. Total mortality (Z) was estimated with Ault and Ehrhardt method in the FiSAT II package. The model was chosen with its relaxed assumption on the lifespan of the species being analyzed.EXPLAIN? ​</a>

                            4. The study was conducted in the general area of Tablas Strait, in Mansalay Bay, on the island of Mindoro, central Philippines . The study site has a multispecies seagrass area starting at the intertidal zone to a depth of 1 meter. Between 1.5 to 2 meters in depth, coral bommies occur. Sand and rubble area with sporadic Halophila patches are found at 2–10-meter depths. The population survey was done for eight consecutive quarters starting in September 2011. A systematic search of aggregations was done by deploying an imaginary transect belt with a 20-meter width. A paddle boat was rowed, and made a survey stop every 50-meter distance. Aggregations were searched within a 20-meters radius of the boat. The search was aided by local fishermen who are used to looking for visual signs of aggregations from water surface down to 10-meters depth. As a preliminary to establishing the species' age frequency data, an investigation of whether shape changes with age was conducted. A total of 256 individuals were collected by hand randomly from the observed aggregations to serve as test organisms. Animals were boiled to facilitate the cleaning of the shells. An a-priori aging was done based on the length and lip thickness (Poiner and Catterall 1988; Catterall et al. 2001): &lt; 10 mm length are early recruits; 20–30 mm length with &lt; 2 mm lip thickness are yearlings; 30–40 mm length with &lt; 2 mm lip thickness are young adults; 30–45 mm length with 2.1-3.9 mm lip thickness as adults; and 30–45 mm length with &gt; 4 mm lip thickness as mature adults. The shells were later photographed laying on their adaxial side using a Canon S95 digital camera with grid settings to assist in focusing on the image. Positioning was made constant by making the suture between the lip and the body whorl constantly visible on the image and the central portion of the shell filling the center quadrat of the camera grid. This was facilitated by setting the shell on clay dough to prevent toppling. Acquired images were edited using Microsoft® Office Picture Manager retaining 1-centimeter space around each image. Ten (10) landmarks and 29 semi-landmarks were digitized along the surface of the captured images using tpsDig by Rohlf (2005)are specific features that can easily be located, such as tips, maximum curvatures, and sutures, while semi-landmarks are points with relative positions from a landmark or along a surface (Zelditch et al. 2004). The acquired spatial points were converted into coordinates by tpsRelW (Rohlf 2003), which allowed data processing as shape variables. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was done in MorphoJ (Klininger 2011) to determine possible age differences. Finally, the maximization of group separation was done with Canonical Variate Analysis (CVA). All individuals from observed aggregations were photographed on their adaxial side in situ. Shells heavily encrusted with algae were lightly cleaned to expose the shell outline. Photos were processed using the same methodologies done on test organisms. A total of 3,624 individuals were used for this study. Using the values from the CVA of the test organisms, Discriminant Function Analysis (DFA) in R (R Core Team 2016) was applied to age sample individuals to derive the age frequency distribution. Then, the derived age frequency data were used to compute growth parameters, mortality rates, recruitment patterns, exploitation rate, and yield per recruit using FiSAT (FAO-ICLAM Assessment Tool) package (Gayanilo et al. 2005). Growth was assumed to be described by von Bertalanffy equation which had been proven to apply to bivalves and other gastropods (Dolorosa and Dangan-Galon 2014; del NorteCampos and Villarta 2010; Al-Barwani et al. 2007; Cob et al. 2009; Tumanda et al. 1997). The estimated maximum size when species is not caught (L∞), as well as the constant growth rate (K), was initially estimated by scanning for possible values given the age-frequency distribution using Elefan I in FISAT (Tumanda et al. 1997; Cob et al. 2008; Dolorosa and Dangan-Galon 2014). The values were confirmed with the subsequent fitting of derived age-frequency values where the Rn-value is the highest. Subsequently, the best combination of L∞ and K was taken using the Powell-Wetherall plot to take the proportion of total mortality (Z) and the growth rate (K). The K-value was taken as an approximation of the natural mortality (M) value which applies to exploited stocks that make a collection of natural mortality data impossible (Tumanda et al. 1997). For this approximation, the second point representing the yearling group (Age 1) was assumed to be fully recruited to the fishery. Total mortality (Z) was estimated with Ault and Ehrhardt method in the FiSAT II package. The model was chosen with its relaxed assumption on the lifespan of the species being analyzed.EXPLAIN? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> a study that was conducted on a species of snail in the Tablas Strait, in the Philippines. The study aimed to determine the age frequency distribution of the snails and to use this information to calculate various population parameters, such as growth, mortality rates, and exploitation rates. The study used a combination of field observations and laboratory analysis to collect and analyze data on the snails. The field observations involved systematically searching for aggregations of the snails in a specific area, and the laboratory analysis involved cleaning and photographing the shells of the snails and using software to digitize and analyze their shapes. The results of the analysis were used to age individual snails and to calculate population parameters.</p><br />

Ptolemy believed that the world was made up of nested spheres that surrounded the <strong>Earth</strong>, based on the information he claim. The Moon, he believed, orbited on a sphere nearest to the <strong>Earth</strong>, followed by Mercury, Venus, and finally the Sun.</p>OBLATE SPHEROID<p>    A spinning fluid (including the Earth, which is "fluid" in astronomical time periods) imagine is an oblate spheroid as a first approximation. The surface of a revolution formed by rotating an ellipse around its minor axis is known as an oblate spheroid (Hilbert and Cohn-Vossen 1999, p. 10).</p>NORTH STAR<p>The North Star, also known as Polaris, is known for remaining practically motionless in our sky as the rest of the northern sky journeys around it. This is because of its proximity to the north celestial pole, the axis around which the entire northern sky revolves. Polaris is a constellation that goes to the part of the north direction.</p>ARISTOTLE<p>Aristotle was one of the most powerful philosophers of all time and the world's first true scientist. He made groundbreaking contributions to all chapters of philosophy and science, inventing the field of formal logic and identifying and exploring the links between the scientific disciplines.</p>ECLIPSE<p>Eclipse is a programming platform that uses an integrated development environment. It comes with a high-standard workspace and a plug-in outline for customizing our environment. It is the second-most-common Java development IDE, and it was the most famous until 2016. Eclipse is primarily penciled in Java and is intended for the development of Java applications, although it may also be used to create so many programs on other programming platforms.</p>SHADOW<p>A shadow is a kind of black region created by an opaque object blocking light from a light source. It made up all three-dimensional volumes at the back of the item that has light shining on it. A shadow across the direction is a two-dimensional silhouette or reverses the projection of the item that is obstructing the light. A dark or black region in a photograph is an example of a shadow. A pitch-dark corner from which a terrifying apparition emerges is an illustration of the shadow.</p>ERATOSTHENES<p>A Greek polymath, Eratosthenes of Cyrene was a mathematician, geographer, poet, astronomer, and music theorist. He was a student scholar who obtain the position of chief librarian in the Library of Alexandria. Eratosthenes calculated the circumference of the Earth mathematically putting it into two surface points. At the summer solstice, he observed the Sun's rays collapse vertically at noon near Syene (now Aswan), Egypt.</p><p>Explain How the Greeks knew that the earth is spherical? brainly.ph/question/1375318</p><p>What is the major event that led to the emergence of the geography​ https://brainly.ph/question/6899124</p><p>The ancient Greek who is known for championing the concept of atom was named https://brainly.ph/question/2109850</p><p><strong>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</strong></p><br />
