                                            Based on the Severe Weather Bulletin # 3 issued at 05:00 PM today by the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Typhoon "ROLLY^ prime prime will make landfall over Aurora Quezon Provinces on Sunday evening or Monday early morning, traverse Central Luzon and affect nearly the entirety of Luzon Island. Due to its trajectory, current severe intensity and potentially high-volume rainfall, "ROLLY^ prime prime can be expected to generate volcanic sediment flows or lahars, muddy streamflows or muddy run-off in rivers and drainage areas on the monitored active volcanoes of Mayon, Pinatubo and Taal. DOST-PHIVOLCS thus strongly recommends increased vigilance and readiness of communities in pre-determined zones of lahar and related hazards on these volcanoes.Prolonged and heavy rainfall may generate post-eruption lahars on major channels draining Mayon Volcano by incorporating loose material from remnant pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits from the January-March 2018 eruption. The bulk of erodible PDC deposits occupy the watershed areas of the Miisi, Mabinit, Buyuan and Basud Channels. In addition, older and erodible eruption deposits occupy the watershed areas on the eastern and western slopes of the edifice and can be remobilized as non-eruption lahars by erosion of banks and channel beds.. Mayon lahars can threaten communities downstream of the above channels with inundation, burial and wash away.Pinatubo lahars are likely be channel-confined and occur on the upper to middle reaches of the Sto. Tomas Marella and Bucao River systems but may transition to muddy streamflows and floods on the lower reaches and affect adjacent communities of San Marcelino, San Narciso, San Felipe and Botolan, Zambales Province. Muddy streamflows may likewise be generated along the O'Donnell and Pasig-Potrero River systems draining the Pinatubo edifice to the north and southeast, respectively and affect downstream communities in Tarlac and PampangaInstructions: (Knowledge, Understanding and Critical Thinking) Read the rubric or guide for assessing your scores, try to express your answer based on the given guideabove.

                        The Philippine’s education system is managed by the Philippine department of education. It controls the general running of schools and colleges in the Philippines and controls the curriculum in the Philippine’s education system. It also details things such as how teachers are to be hired and what qualifications they should have. My sequence essay is based on the education of a person born in the Philippines. The country achieved independence in 1946, so before that time it was colonial powers that regulated education. Those colonial powers came from the USA and Spain. The education system changed radically since the country achieved independence. There are six years of compulsory elementary education. This starts at around the age of six and goes up to the age of 12. The date that classes start is the same across the country, though some holidays do vary. Still, the curriculum must start in all schools at the same time. This is probably because it means any exams happen at the same time across the country.<br />As a young person, you are required to start school at the age of six and keep working until you reach the age of 12. At that age, you may be able to stay at your current school for your High School education, or you may have to move to another school to get your High School education.<br /><br /><br />

The provision of quality education and an ambient learning environment encourages the Filipino people to nurture and enhance their knowledge, potentials, and creativity. By providing quality education to the Filipino youth, we are enabling the youth of the nation to grow into globally competitive professionals, thus, offering the country with a better quality of living. </p><p></p><p>Before the Philippines broke away from their rule under Spain and the United States, their educational system was arranged according to their colonial powers. This radically changed after the Philippines carried off with their independence in 1946. The Philippines implemented a 10-year basic educational system composed of…show more content…</p><p>Cebu City National Science High School shall correspond its system to the new K to 12 educational program that is being implemented throughout the country.  The new K to 12 educational program is accompanied by a new curriculum where it implies that the mastery of academic concepts is not sufficient enough for young professionals to face the real world. Thus, the Department of Education or DepEd has incorporated media and technology skills, learning and innovation skills, effective communication skills, and life and career skills. Through this system, the Cebu City National Science High School shall be able to incorporate the new curriculum to the institution’s design and planning.  Unfortunately, the current facilities of the educational institution are not able to accommodate to the updated K to 12 program as more classrooms, laboratories, and ancillary rooms are related.</p><p>We should partake in things that we believe in and things that will contribute to our success. However, public education prepares you to become something you are not and grow out of your creativity. It gives you the false hope that what you have desire to become is something else because you were not taught in a way to prepare for you to exhibit yourself into the world. There are many things that is learned in school, but is soon realized on how eventually we can not use these life lessons in our lives. For example, a person who wants to be a musician is forced to intensely focus on science, math and English when it does not correspond to the musical field.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Philippine COVID-19 Response
<p>
</p><p>It was December 31, 2019. People all over the world are optimistic about the year 2020 because it brings in a new decade. However, in Wuhan, China, dozens of people are mysteriously dying from pneumonia.
</p><p>
Three months later, the whole world is on a lockdown, and the number of infected kept on rising. The World Health Organization decided to name this new disease as <strong>COVID-19</strong>, and the virus that causes it as SARS-COV-2. During the first phase of the pandemic, the Philippines had to close its doors from the outside world. Towns, cities, and provinces also closed their borders. People stockpiled because they do not know how long the lockdown will last.
</p><p>
There were multiple surges in 2020, and it carried over to 2021. Tens of thousands have died, and then, a miracle came in the form of vaccines. At first, there were only a few thousand people who are being vaccinated, but as the government became aggressive on their vaccination program, tens of millions of Filipinos have been inoculated. Today, the cases are dropping, and the Philippines is slowly reopening, thanks to the effort of the government, the medical professionals, and everyone who made it possible.

Plants that were previously wilted spring to life in the rainy season. </p><p></p><p>Animals are also active during the rainy season. This is the season where farmers look forward to, as rain becomes the saving grace for their crops. However, the season also has the potential to bring about large scale destruction if preventive measures are not taken. Floods, hurricanes, storms and other water-related natural calamities usually occur during the rainy season. </p><p></p><p>Historically, people have always associated the rainy season with the growth of vegetation. However, from an agricultural perspective, food crops do not reach their full maturity and it can cause food shortages in some parts of the world. </p><p></p><p>During this season, an increase in the incidence of malaria and other water-borne diseases are also observed. The sudden onset of monsoon can also make people prone to other diseases such as jaundice, typhoid, and cholera. </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Learning Objectives
</p><p>Understand the expectations for reading and writing assignments in post-secondary (university, college, institute) courses
</p><p>Understand and apply general strategies to complete post-secondary-level reading assignments efficiently and effectively
</p><p>Recognize specific types of writing assignments frequently included in post-secondary courses
</p><p>Understand and apply general strategies for managing post-secondary-level writing assignments
</p><p>Determine specific reading and writing strategies that work best for you individually
</p><p>In a post-secondary environment, academic expectations change from what you may have experienced in high school. The quantity of work you are expected to do is increased. When instructors expect you to read pages upon pages or study hours and hours for one particular course, managing your workload can be challenging. This chapter includes strategies for studying efficiently and managing your time.
</p><p>
</p><p>The quality of the work you do also changes. It is not enough to understand course material and summarize it on an exam. You will also be expected to seriously engage with new ideas by reflecting on them, analyzing them, critiquing them, making connections, drawing conclusions, or finding new ways of thinking about a given subject. Educationally, you are moving into deeper waters. A good introductory writing course will help you swim.

                            30. Based on the Severe Weather Bulletin # 3 issued at 05:00 PM today by the Philippine Atmospheric Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA), Typhoon "ROLLY^ prime prime will make landfall over Aurora Quezon Provinces on Sunday evening or Monday early morning, traverse Central Luzon and affect nearly the entirety of Luzon Island. Due to its trajectory, current severe intensity and potentially high-volume rainfall, "ROLLY^ prime prime can be expected to generate volcanic sediment flows or lahars, muddy streamflows or muddy run-off in rivers and drainage areas on the monitored active volcanoes of Mayon, Pinatubo and Taal. DOST-PHIVOLCS thus strongly recommends increased vigilance and readiness of communities in pre-determined zones of lahar and related hazards on these volcanoes.Prolonged and heavy rainfall may generate post-eruption lahars on major channels draining Mayon Volcano by incorporating loose material from remnant pyroclastic density current (PDC) deposits from the January-March 2018 eruption. The bulk of erodible PDC deposits occupy the watershed areas of the Miisi, Mabinit, Buyuan and Basud Channels. In addition, older and erodible eruption deposits occupy the watershed areas on the eastern and western slopes of the edifice and can be remobilized as non-eruption lahars by erosion of banks and channel beds.. Mayon lahars can threaten communities downstream of the above channels with inundation, burial and wash away.Pinatubo lahars are likely be channel-confined and occur on the upper to middle reaches of the Sto. Tomas Marella and Bucao River systems but may transition to muddy streamflows and floods on the lower reaches and affect adjacent communities of San Marcelino, San Narciso, San Felipe and Botolan, Zambales Province. Muddy streamflows may likewise be generated along the O'Donnell and Pasig-Potrero River systems draining the Pinatubo edifice to the north and southeast, respectively and affect downstream communities in Tarlac and PampangaInstructions: (Knowledge, Understanding and Critical Thinking) Read the rubric or guide for assessing your scores, try to express your answer based on the given guideabove.
