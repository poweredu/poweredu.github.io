                                            Philippines is Most Gender-Equal Country in Asia -reportSource: CNN Philippines at https://www.cnn.ph/news/2018/12/18/Philippines-Global-Gender-Gap-Report-2018.htmlMetro Manila (CNN Philippines, December 18) - The Philippines remains the topAsian country with the narrowest gap between men and women, according to a global reportreleased Tuesday.The World Economic Forum (WEF)'s Global Gender Gap Report for 2018 also rankedthe Philippines eighth among 149 countries in achieving gender equality. It said the countrygot its record-high score of 0.799, which means it has closed almost 80 percent of its overallgender gap. The country also improved two notches from being on the 10th spot in 2017. Thereport listed the Philippines among the five countries that have achieved full parity in politicaland economic leadership - with women legislators, senior officials and managers. Othercountries with the same achievement are Laos, Bahamas, Colombia, and Jamaica. ThePhilippines' gender gap in the educational attainment pillar remains closed, like last year. Thismeans the literacy rate and enrolment in schools are almost the same for men and women.Meanwhile, the report noted that the Philippines managed to narrow its EconomicParticipation and Opportunity gender gap "due to increases in wage equality for similar workand women's estimated earned income," the report noted. Based on the WEF's annualExecutive Opinion Survey, the Philippines closed 79 percent of the gap on wage equality thisyear, from 75 percent in 2017. The Philippines, however, got the lowest score of 0.416 in thearea of political empowerment, which means it has yet to close almost 60 percent of the gap,and it is not alone. "Political Empowerment is where the gender gap remains the widest(globally): only 23% of the political gap - unchanged since last year - has been closed, andno country has yet fully closed political empowerment gaps," the report said. This indicatormeasures the gap between men and women at the highest level of political decision-making,either as head of state or in key parliamentary and ministerial positions,In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has publicly said he prefers to appointmen in government, saying they can get his many orders done.Globally, a lot more needs to be done. "Today, the Global Gender Gap score stands at 68percent. This means that, on average, there is still a 32 percent gap to close," the report said.​</a>

________________________________
The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.

Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</a>

In an interview with CNN Philippines on Friday, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said moving the opening of schools to a later date would be challenging for public schools as some private schools have already started their classes."Ang iniiwasan po natin na magiging behind ang ating mga public elementary and high school students natin (What we're trying to avoid is our public elementary and high school students being left behind)," he said.Briones said that the moving of classes to October was based on theeffect of MECQ in the two regions - National Capital Region (NCR)and Region IV-A - that have the "biggest number of enrollments"for this school year."Some suggested September but the President chose October to give space for school opening preparations," she added. This is the second time that the DepEd has moved the school opening.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, school opening for SY 2020-2021 was originally scheduled on June 1. Due to the ongoing public health situation, DepEd had decided to move the school opening to Aug. 24. "We trust that this is the final adjustment of the school opening," she said.Question11.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The president of the Philippines (Filipino: Pangulo ng Pilipinas, sometimes referred to as Presidente ng Pilipinas) is the head of state and the head of government of the Philippines. The president leads the executive branch of the Philippine government and is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines. The president is directly elected by the people, and is one of only two nationally elected executive officials, the other being the vice president of the Philippines. However, four vice presidents have assumed the presidency without having been elected to the office, by virtue of a president's intra-term death or resignation.[f</p><br />

                            3. Philippines is Most Gender-Equal Country in Asia -reportSource: CNN Philippines at https://www.cnn.ph/news/2018/12/18/Philippines-Global-Gender-Gap-Report-2018.htmlMetro Manila (CNN Philippines, December 18) - The Philippines remains the topAsian country with the narrowest gap between men and women, according to a global reportreleased Tuesday.The World Economic Forum (WEF)'s Global Gender Gap Report for 2018 also rankedthe Philippines eighth among 149 countries in achieving gender equality. It said the countrygot its record-high score of 0.799, which means it has closed almost 80 percent of its overallgender gap. The country also improved two notches from being on the 10th spot in 2017. Thereport listed the Philippines among the five countries that have achieved full parity in politicaland economic leadership - with women legislators, senior officials and managers. Othercountries with the same achievement are Laos, Bahamas, Colombia, and Jamaica. ThePhilippines' gender gap in the educational attainment pillar remains closed, like last year. Thismeans the literacy rate and enrolment in schools are almost the same for men and women.Meanwhile, the report noted that the Philippines managed to narrow its EconomicParticipation and Opportunity gender gap "due to increases in wage equality for similar workand women's estimated earned income," the report noted. Based on the WEF's annualExecutive Opinion Survey, the Philippines closed 79 percent of the gap on wage equality thisyear, from 75 percent in 2017. The Philippines, however, got the lowest score of 0.416 in thearea of political empowerment, which means it has yet to close almost 60 percent of the gap,and it is not alone. "Political Empowerment is where the gender gap remains the widest(globally): only 23% of the political gap - unchanged since last year - has been closed, andno country has yet fully closed political empowerment gaps," the report said. This indicatormeasures the gap between men and women at the highest level of political decision-making,either as head of state or in key parliamentary and ministerial positions,In the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte has publicly said he prefers to appointmen in government, saying they can get his many orders done.Globally, a lot more needs to be done. "Today, the Global Gender Gap score stands at 68percent. This means that, on average, there is still a 32 percent gap to close," the report said.​</h2><br />

________________________________
The shift of focus from access to quality is part of the Department’s Quality Basic Education reform plan and a step towards globalizing the quality of Philippine basic education. The move got the green light after DepEd secured at the 43rd Cabinet Meeting the approval and support of President Rodrigo Roa Duterte and the Cabinet for the national effort to raise the quality of basic education.
Speaking before various partners and stakeholders, Briones presented the ongoing interventions of the Department that will improve the quality of learning in public schools. The interventions include curriculum review, transformation of the National Educators Academy of the Philippines (NEAP), proposal to extend the levels of teacher positions, and the Last Mile Schools program.
“We have to address the challenge of quality which will be difficult. We cannot do it in three years or even in six years. [We have to address the challenge of quality ] now that we have an idea of how we stand with the rest of the world; now that we are more familiar with our challenges [are] relative to the rest of world and to the rest of the region ,” Briones said.
The Secretary stressed that reading in English is the weakness of learners which affects their performance in Science and Math, as the medium of instruction and testing in later grades is English.
Sec. Briones instructed DepEd’s Curriculum and Instruction strand specifically the Bureau of Curriculum Development (BCD), and the Bureau of Education Assessment (BEA) to study further how the choice of language affects test performance of learners.
“Does the choice of language affect test performance? Reading in English is clearly a weakness of our learners, and this may also affect the performance of our learners in Science and Math as the language of instruction and testing in later grades is English,” Briones explained.
Department of Education (DepEd) Secretary Leonor Magtolis Briones issued directives to address the challenge of quality in basic education during the Multi-Stakeholder Panel Discussion: PISA and the Challenge of Education Quality in the Philippines held at SEAMEO Innotech on December 4.

“Obviously, we need to strengthen our teaching and learning in English if we are to continue with English as our language of instruction and testing,” she added.
She also instructed the concerned offices to ensure that through the curriculum review the foundational competencies of reading and numeracy are clearly articulated, and are not sacrificed by congestion of ancillary competencies.
“I direct the Bureau of Education Assessment to be more proactive in interacting with our units and the field to ensure alignment of our national and system assessment with curricular goals and instructional and classroom assessment practices at the school and classroom levels,” the Secretary added.
Briones further emphasized that it is at the level of the school and the classroom that quality will ultimately depend.
“Addressing the challenge of quality will be a difficult and long-drawn process. But the more challenging [the] task for all of us is how to concretely translate Sulong EduKalidad at the school and classroom level,” she stated.
In closing, Briones urged all stakeholders to join DepEd in achieving its goal for quality basic education in the country.
“We have to work out our own solutions. We need all of you, all of us, we own education. Let us start working together. Let us start talking and let us start acting in two years time,” the Secretary concluded.

                            5. I have no question, I just wrote a story and wanted to share it lol
Sam’s Snail
One fine morning, a boy who goes by Sam was passing through the neighbourhood at 6:30 in the morning to make it to his school early. He was thinking about what the next class pet would be as the last one sadly died of thirst. 
His thoughts were interrupted when he saw a small snail upside-down on the sidewalk. He watched the snail struggle and try it’s best to get back up. Feeling sympathetic, he tipped it over. The snail continued on its way to the busy road. When Sam tried turning the snail around to make it face the grass, it still continued to the road.
Knowing the vehicles on the road could easily squish the puny snail, he decided to simply just bring it with him to school. He grabbed the empty container his mom always packs for him just in case and carefully placed the snail inside. He looked around and noticed a flower bush. He picked a leave and placed it in the container as well.
During class hours, he’d keep the snail’s container on top of his bag as it was full and he had to watch over the little critter. The adviser of his class made her students list down all the presidents of the Philippines they knew. As she was passing by her students, checking if everyone was working, she noticed the snail container on Sam’s bag and stared at it for a few seconds. 
“Sam, may I ask about this snail on top of your bag?” She asked him picking up the container in curiosity. “Teacher, that’s a snail I found going to school this morning, it had a huge risk of dying if he continued going to the busy road so I brought it to school to keep it safe.” Sam answered. “I see…may I speak to you after class?” She looked at him. “Sure ma’am.” Sam went back to listing presidents.
“Sam, I have questions regarding the snail. You know how no one brought a new class pet for us today right?” The teacher said as she pushed her glasses up her nose. “Yes po.” The adviser looked at him, “I would like to ask you if the snail could become the next class pet? We need a replacement for Tom the Tortoise. It’s fine if not.” He thought for a bit and asked himself “Why not?” “Sure teacher, we can make him the class pet.” The adviser’s eyes lit up and a smile crept on her face.
 “Great! Say, what is the name of the little fella?” She asked. “Eum, its name is…Shelly! Shelly the Snail.” Sam blurted out the first thing that came in mind. “Alright, I’ll bring it home and find a proper container for it.”
Since it was almost the end of the school year, Shelly ended up becoming their class pet until the last day of class. During it’s time as class pet, it became so popular it became the school’s new mascot! Who knew a snail found walking to school could achieve so much?</h2><br />

In an interview with CNN Philippines on Friday, Cabinet Secretary Karlo Nograles said moving the opening of schools to a later date would be challenging for public schools as some private schools have already started their classes."Ang iniiwasan po natin na magiging behind ang ating mga public elementary and high school students natin (What we're trying to avoid is our public elementary and high school students being left behind)," he said.Briones said that the moving of classes to October was based on theeffect of MECQ in the two regions - National Capital Region (NCR)and Region IV-A - that have the "biggest number of enrollments"for this school year."Some suggested September but the President chose October to give space for school opening preparations," she added. This is the second time that the DepEd has moved the school opening.Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, school opening for SY 2020-2021 was originally scheduled on June 1. Due to the ongoing public health situation, DepEd had decided to move the school opening to Aug. 24. "We trust that this is the final adjustment of the school opening," she said.Question11.
