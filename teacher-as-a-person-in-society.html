Salary Increase for Public School Teachers
It is not unknown to many people that public school teachers fund their job since the government does not provide enough funds for them. They use their own money to repaint their classrooms. They get from their own pockets the fees for classroom materials and sometimes food for some students who could barely eat twice a day. They spend thousands of pesos to fund their graduate studies and seminars. They are also given tasks that are beyond teaching. Yet they do all these in the hope of making their students learn the skills that they try so hard to impart to them. Knowing all these, the government should raise the salary of our public-school teachers.
During the campaign period, the president promised a pay hike for teachers. Yet, years later, it has not been fulfilled. Even lawmakers have been passing bills on salary increase among government workers, but not one is implemented. They keep on saying that there are not enough funds for the hike and a reallocation of budget needs to be done to fulfill it. However, in a 2018 report, the Commission on Audit states that there is an unexplained P13 billion worth of expenses by the Department of Education. Aside from that, error-filled textbooks and other unnecessary expenses keep on slashing the education funds when in fact, these mismanaged large sums of money could have been used for the teachers’ salary increase.
Spending on teachers will be worth it. They make the best out of the limited resources that they have, so imagine if they are fully funded while their personal and professional needs are duly augmented. The quality of education will become better. Modern technology can and will be used in classrooms, as expected. Teachers and schools could provide more up-to-date, accurate, and more appropriate learning materials for learners.
The government must increase the salary of public-school teachers. It is beneficial to all stakeholders such as students, parents, and the community. Augmenting the salary of teachers for the betterment of their lives cascades to those who directly benefit from them: the Filipino learners. It cannot be stressed enough how teachers, like any other professionals, are vital in building a strong society.</a>

Salary Increase for Public School Teachers
It is not unknown to many people that public school teachers fund their job since the government does not provide enough funds for them. They use their own money to repaint their classrooms. They get from their own pockets the fees for classroom materials and sometimes food for some students who could barely eat twice a day. They spend thousands of pesos to fund their graduate studies and seminars. They are also given tasks that are beyond teaching. Yet they do all these in the hope of making their students learn the skills that they try so hard to impart to them. Knowing all these, the government should raise the salary of our public-school teachers.
During the campaign period, the president promised a pay hike for teachers. Yet, years later, it has not been fulfilled. Even lawmakers have been passing bills on salary increase among government workers, but not one is implemented. They keep on saying that there are not enough funds for the hike and a reallocation of budget needs to be done to fulfill it. However, in a 2018 report, the Commission on Audit states that there is an unexplained P13 billion worth of expenses by the Department of Education. Aside from that, error-filled textbooks and other unnecessary expenses keep on slashing the education funds when in fact, these mismanaged large sums of money could have been used for the teachers’ salary increase.
Spending on teachers will be worth it. They make the best out of the limited resources that they have, so imagine if they are fully funded while their personal and professional needs are duly augmented. The quality of education will become better. Modern technology can and will be used in classrooms, as expected. Teachers and schools could provide more up-to-date, accurate, and more appropriate learning materials for learners.
The government must increase the salary of public-school teachers. It is beneficial to all stakeholders such as students, parents, and the community. Augmenting the salary of teachers for the betterment of their lives cascades to those who directly benefit from them: the Filipino learners. It cannot be stressed enough how teachers, like any other professionals, are vital in building a strong society.</a>

Salary Increase for Public School Teachers
It is not unknown to many people that public school teachers fund their job since the government does not provide enough funds for them. They use their own money to repaint their classrooms. They get from their own pockets the fees for classroom materials and sometimes food for some students who could barely eat twice a day. They spend thousands of pesos to fund their graduate studies and seminars. They are also given tasks that are beyond teaching. Yet they do all these in the hope of making their students learn the skills that they try so hard to impart to them. Knowing all these, the government should raise the salary of our public-school teachers.
During the campaign period, the president promised a pay hike for teachers. Yet, years later, it has not been fulfilled. Even lawmakers have been passing bills on salary increase among government workers, but not one is implemented. They keep on saying that there are not enough funds for the hike and a reallocation of budget needs to be done to fulfill it. However, in a 2018 report, the Commission on Audit states that there is an unexplained P13 billion worth of expenses by the Department of Education. Aside from that, error-filled textbooks and other unnecessary expenses keep on slashing the education funds when in fact, these mismanaged large sums of money could have been used for the teachers’ salary increase.
Spending on teachers will be worth it. They make the best out of the limited resources that they have, so imagine if they are fully funded while their personal and professional needs are duly augmented. The quality of education will become better. Modern technology can and will be used in classrooms, as expected. Teachers and schools could provide more up-to-date, accurate, and more appropriate learning materials for learners.
The government must increase the salary of public-school teachers. It is beneficial to all stakeholders such as students, parents, and the community. Augmenting the salary of teachers for the betterment of their lives cascades to those who directly benefit from them: the Filipino learners. It cannot be stressed enough how teachers, like any other professionals, are vital in building a strong society.</h2><br />
