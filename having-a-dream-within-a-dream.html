The poem vividly describes the difference between dreams and reality. 4. The main idea of the poem is to live in the Present because our Time on earth may not be enough. 5.

You and the rest of your dream will be his movie, and he will silently observe. Never interacting, not for a moment. And yet, somehow, you will still know that he is there. Are you comforted? Or do you feel sinister intent in his gaze? Do you sense that his presence is dangerous? Or is he only here to protect you? From what? From what? From what? From what? From what? From what?

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

Soon, Tom was walking down a quiet, lovely road. The road led to a mighty andmajestic place— Westminster. Tom stared in glad wonder at the magnificent array of Englishroyalty. Perhaps, now, he would be able to see a prince of flesh and blood.There were many country folks and people from the city. All at once, he caught sight of aspectacle that almost made him shout out of joy. Within was an attractive-looking boy. He wasclothed in lovely silk and satin, shining with jewels. Several gorgeous gentlemen stood nearhim. Oh! He was a prince without a shadow of a doubt. The prayer of the pauper boy's heartwas answered at last.Tom's breath came quick and short with excitement. His eyes grew big with wonder anddelight. He wanted to have a good, devouring look at the prince. The next instant, one of thesoldiers snatched him rudely away.The soldier said, “Mind your manners, you young beggar!"The crowd jeered and laughed. But the young prince sprang to the gate. He cried out,"How dare you treat a poor boy that way! How dare you treat my father's subject so! Open thegate and let the boy in!”yan po ung unang story​</a>

When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams.

Even if I may die, I will still ask forgiveness for they are my family and God is merciful. I don't need anyone to beg on their knees for forgiveness if they did anything wrong and careless. It needs to be me who will be on the knees. If they need anything, I will give them anything if I am about to die because when (not saying I will after what I did in the story)  I go to God, everything that I need is in front of me.

Perhaps, now, he would be able to see a prince of flesh and blood.There were many country folks and people from the city. All at once, he caught sight of aspectacle that almost made him shout out of joy. Within was an attractive-looking boy. He wasclothed in lovely silk and satin, shining with jewels. Several gorgeous gentlemen stood nearhim. Oh! He was a prince without a shadow of a doubt. The prayer of the pauper boy's heartwas answered at last.Tom's breath came quick and short with excitement. His eyes grew big with wonder anddelight. He wanted to have a good, devouring look at the prince. The next instant, one of thesoldiers snatched him rudely away.The soldier said, “Mind your manners, you young beggar!"The crowd jeered and laughed. But the young prince sprang to the gate.
