                        Helping minimize the effect of Earthquake as a studentAnswer:<p>Although apparently, <strong>Earthquakes</strong> are an inevitable part of our lives especially given that we are near the pacific ring of fire. Even when there is just so little we can do against natural disasters, there are still some things we can do, and always no that doing something is always great than doing nothing. As student's what can we really do when there are <strong>earthquakes</strong>? Well there is one in my mind. The Philippines has set in their mind that awareness and prevention are better than cure, which is true, the reason why every year they conduct lots of <strong>earthquake</strong> drills to help the citizens, organizations to come and be prepared when these things happen. Taking the earthquake drill seriously as a student every time they conduct an <strong>earthquake</strong> drill will help minimize the effect of an earthquake. It will raise the survival ability of the citizens and even knowing the drill can make them useful during the <strong>earthquake</strong> itself. </p><p>Know here what is an Earthquake:</p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/4169967</p><p></p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>We cannot prevent natural earthquakes from occurring but we can significantly mitigate their effects by identifying hazards, building safer structures, and providing education on earthquake safety. By preparing for natural earthquakes we can also reduce the risk from human induced earthquakes.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>sana makatulong pa brainliest po salamat</p><br />
