Lead dancers known as shamans served as the tribes' healers, spiritual authorities, and guardians.</p><p></p><p>Dance in the <strong>Late 16th and 17th Centuries</strong> intricate pageants and performances gave rise to masque dancing in the 16th century. Masque dance required elaborate costume creation and set construction, as well as singing, acting, and dancing. It was frequently utilized as court entertainment.
