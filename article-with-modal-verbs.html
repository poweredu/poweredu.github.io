These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and lo stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Regrets</p><p>As we get older and when we think about our past we sometimes ponder the things that we should have done. And we also may regret those things we did badly and the mistakes we made. In reality, we can always learn from our mistakes and hope to never make them again. For example, if I failed a test because of a lack of study, the next test I will hope to pass because of hard work. Remember too that some regrets are not based in reality and we may waste time thinking that they are. Would I have really not have been involved in a car crash if I had been driving more slowly? After all, the other driver ought to have been concentrating and not playing with their radio. We have to be honest with ourselves and live in the now. The only things we can control are the things happening now, in this moment.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p>Gain the skills you need to succeed whilst improving your language confidence with our courses for adults.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>This old joke plays on different interpretations of can. The student is asking for permission, whereas the teacher is talking about ability. Some people might say that the student’s use of can is incorrect (i.e. the student should say May I go to the bathroom?). This view, however, is based on a very narrow understanding of modality and modal verbs in English.</p><p>in this article we take a closer look at modal verbs. We begin by looking at their function in English and exploring basic properties. We then go on to look in more detail at the most common uses of the important modal verbs can, could, will and would. In article Modal verbs 2, we complete the story by covering may, might, must, should and ought to.</p><p>Modal verbs in English</p><p>As well as making simple statements or asking questions, we may sometimes want to express our intentions and attitudes, talk about necessity and possibility, or make offers, requests, or suggestions. In English, these uses of language are usually expressed by a set of verbs called modals. Modals always occur with other verbs, and can be thought of as a special kind of auxiliary verb, e.g.</p><p>I must go to the post office.</p><p>Can I borrow your umbrella?</p><p>The most commonly used modals in English are:</p><p>can / could / will / would / may / might / must / ought to / should</p><p>Modals are mainly used when we want to indicate our attitude to what we are saying, or when we are considering how what we say will affect the person we are communicating with. Compare:</p><p>She’s the oldest. vs. She might be the oldest.</p><p>(Here the modal shows that the speaker is not absolutely sure that the statement is true.)</p><p>Close the door. vs. Could/would/will you close the door?</p><p>(Here the modals turn an instruction into a polite request.)</p><p>Some basic characteristics of modals</p><p>a) Modals are always followed by the base form of the verb, e.g.</p><p>I might play tennis tomorrow.</p><p>You ought to tell her.</p><p>Sometimes a modal is followed by the base form of auxiliaries have or be, followed by a participle, e.g.</p><p>I might be playing tennis tomorrow.</p><p>You ought to have told her.</p><p>In passive structures, a modal is followed by be or have been and a past participle, e.g.</p><p>She ought to be disqualified.</p><p>The door might have been locked.</p><p>b) Modals never inflect, i.e. they have no –ing or –ed forms, and do not take –s in the third person singular present.</p><p>Note: the modal form could is sometimes thought of as the past tense of can when it refers to the ability to do something, e.g.</p><p>Louise can read. = Louise could read when she was three.</p><p>and also in reported speech, when the modal form would is also thought of as the past tense of will:</p><p>'Jackie can come.' = She said that Jackie could come.</p><p>'You will be late.' = I told her that she would be late.</p><p>c) Unlike other verbs, modals do not use do and did to form negatives. Negatives are formed by putting not immediately after the modal, except in the case of ought to, where the negative form is ought not to (which is sometimes abbreviated to oughtn’t to). The negative of can is written as one word cannot, more usually shortened to can’t. Shall not and will not are abbreviated to shan’t and won’t respectively. Could not and would not usually appear as couldn’t and wouldn’t, e.g.</p><p>I might not play tennis tomorrow.</p><p>You ought not to tell her.</p><p>She can’t come.</p><p>We won’t be ready until five.</p><p>d) Modals do not use do and did to form questions. Questions are formed by placing the modal before the subject. In the case of ought to, ought is placed before the subject and to after it, e.g.</p><p>Can she speak Spanish?</p><p>Ought you to tell her?</p><p>Wouldn’t he help you?</p><p>When will and would are used after a pronoun, they are often shortened to the contracted forms 'll and ’d and joined to the pronoun, e.g.</p><p>I’ll help if you want.</p><p>I’m sure she’ll agree.</p><p>It’d be better if you told her yourself.</p><p>He said that he’d walk home.</p><br />

These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols.

                        Use Modals to Express Ideas.<p></p><p>We <strong>can</strong> not deny the Philippines is famous for its beaches. But, when you want to visit the Philippines, it is not complete if you do not taste their local foods. As a person that already visited the Philippines, I want to give a few pieces of advice about their iconic food that you <strong>should</strong> try! First, let's start with breakfast. In the Philippines, there is a must-try breakfast food that you <strong>need to</strong> try, it is Tocino. it is the Filipino version of bacon or we can call it belly cured in sugar, salt, and other spices. Commonly, tocino is served with sinangag (garlic fried rice), and fried egg. That combination is called Tosilog.  The second must-try food is Kinilaw. Kinilaw is a refreshing food served with raw fish that was marinated in vinegar with calamansi juice, pepper, salt, and chili peppers. Because this food is marinated in vinegar, so the taste is kinda sour but refreshing! so for you who likes the sour taste that makes you feel refreshing, then you <strong>should</strong> try this! The last one is Kare-Kare. What a familiar name right? Kare means curry so that kare-kare is a thick stew consists oxtail, vegetables, and a peanut sauce. It is so good, savory, but  heavy a little bit. But the rest of it, of course, is so delicious.</p><p></p><p></p><p>Learn more about giving an advice to tourists when coming to Philippines for a visit or for a vacation </p><p><strong>https://brainly.ph/question/20023893</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong><br />#SPJ1</strong></p><p></p><br />
