                        ￼Pay tribute and celebrate the life of your friend by writing a heartfelt eulogy. Reading example eulogies for a friend is the best place to start before beginning to write your eulogy. Summarizing your friendship and friend’s life in a short speech will seem impossible. By reading the examples below you will see how a eulogy is typically written and what information is included.<br /><br />You should begin the writing process by collecting the information for the eulogy. Spend time thinking about the memories you shared with your friend, what he or she taught you, what he or she enjoyed in life and why you will miss him or her. You can also speak to his or her other friends and family to help gather information for the eulogy. They can help tell you more about your friends childhood, education, career, family and interests.<br /><br />After you have collected the information for the eulogy you will need to turn it into a draft. The best eulogies for a friend are written multiple times. Your first draft will likely contain too much information, spelling and grammar errors, but that is ok. Rewrite the eulogy a few times until you produce the final version. Read your final draft aloud to friends and family. Use any suggestions they may have and write the final copy of the eulogy.<br /><br />Before giving the eulogy at the funeral you should practice it a few times. Do not worry about memorizing the eulogy; it is perfectly ok to have the speech at the funeral. Remember that friends and family in attendance will be happy to hear your eulogy about your friend and you should not stress about how well your speech is delivered. When reading the speech you should read slowly, make eye contact with the audience and pause often to catch your breath.<br /><br />The example eulogies for a friend below will help inspire you to write a beautiful eulogy to your friend.<br /><br /><br />

It is through example that I learned to be the mother and wife that I am today.</p><p></p><p>   My father is hardworking, strong,loving, and gentle. He loved his family and deeply devoted to my mother and me. However, he was no Saint by any means or stretch of the imagination. As a child, I always looked forward to his childhood friends Uncle Bert and Uncle John coming over our house. They would reminisce and tell stories about their youth, and every once in a while ,usually after few beers , they would forget that I was in the room and start talking of unedited stories. I would always learn new things from my Dad. </p><p>He showed me that genuine love that no other guy gave to me, we usually bond by watching football games and driving around town. I know he was a good friend to anyone of the people here. I admire his passion in drawing and catching fishes in the lake. Now I would like to ask him forgiveness for my mistakes and tell him how I will miss him and I love him so much. Dad, I know you're with God right now please guide us. I love you so much Dad.</p><p></p><p>For more details</p><p>brainly.ph/question/484929</p><br />

                        IN PRAISE OF BEAUTY

O beauty allure, beauty of the hyacinth
Doused by wailing drops of dew shroud
And pierced by the radiant shaft of heaven,
Through the rituals of purity
To tread the virginal soil of Venus.

O like the scenery
Of the splendid garden of Aphrodite,
With Pageantry, the art of Pothos and Himeros,
The pearly dross most sought after
Like a wand that spelled all the eyes of men.

Dazzling aurorae shimmering in deep shadows;
Figure beholding of the twinkling crown Andromeda.
Sunrise awakening the greenery;
Ascending furrowed amber terrain of
The gloaming by the countryside!

Habendum et tenedum!
Before the lily white altar an avowal
Of chastity and tranquility enshrined;
On feather quilted bed day and night
With love elixir soothing the body and the soul! 

Soul melody in diatonic harmony of
Meshed contralto with resonating baritone.
Swell the homophonic rhythm of Azande
As the pitch from my lips wear and decline
And the tempo of my heart increase!

Scented lavender wafting through subtle air;
Aromatic morning of rose bathed with dew
That transports the mind beyond earthly realm
And capture the heart at whim
Lost in imagination of the form and frame.
 
Culinary variety spread in romantic atmosphere
In candlelight banquet of cream and crimson;
Sheer delicacy, man’s greatest savour
Whose delights subsist even in her absence;
Whose substance transcends life’s ideal!

                        Here's an example of eulogy speech to help you through one of the most emotional speeches you'll probably ever have to give in your lifetime.<br /><br />A eulogy or funeral speech is a speech given at a funeral or memorial service to honor the deceased. You may be asked to give a eulogy speech for a family member or a close friend.<br /><br />A eulogy is often one of the most difficult types of speeches to deliver due to its emotional nature, but delivering a good eulogy can be very meaningful for the attendees of the service and particularly for the family members.<br /><br />Important elements of a eulogy are<br /><br />to let the audience know how you knew the deceasedto share a personal story or two that sheds a positive light on the character of the personto let the family members and friends of the deceased know how much their loved one contributed to you or the community and how he or she will be missed.<br /><br />It is perfectly OK to tell a humorous story during a eulogy as long as it is in good taste. Poems on death or quotes on death may be something you want to weave into your eulogy as well.<br /><br />Below is an example of eulogy speech for a 60 year old man given by a close friend. When preparing a eulogy of your own, substitute personal details of your friend or loved one's life for the details in this speech.<br /><br /><br />

The younger children were running in and out of our kitchen nook where we were working. The nook gives a full view of our backyard and the neighbors’ trees towering above their privacy fence.  And then I saw the cherry picker going towards the 50-year-old maple tree in our next door neighbor’s backyard. They had trimmed it back severely last autumn. It was a beautiful old maple tree, providing cool shade and beautiful yellow leaves in the fall. The tree trimmer began to take all of the budding branches off one of the big branches. I could not stand the tension. I closed the blinds, and made another cup of coffee. There was no way that I could teach my daughter and watch the destruction of the tree.</p><br />

                        <strong>Eulogy for Nature</strong><p><strong></strong></p><p>A eulogy about nature itself requires positive things and aspects, most of it will be for something that served as well in our lifetime and never ceased to amaze us by showing wondrous things about life and living with nature.
</p><p><strong>Nature</strong>, our ecosystem or Mother Nature we call it many names due to its care for other living creatures and organisms whether big or small. This is where we first started to learn how to live and how to survive. It gives us life itself by supplying us with:
</p>Food
Water
Shelter
<p>The way we live now is considered “modern” since it involves technology and more electricity. But back when all those things didn’t exist, the place we once called home in Nature. Up to now we still rely on nature very much since it has the ability to heal itself over the time being. What we humans destroy she grows it back again. But what is Mother <strong>nature </strong>gets tired of doing things all over again? We humans continue to give her:
</p>Pollution
Greenhouse Gases
Effects of Fossil Fuels
Cutting trees for other purposes
Sell animals that truly belongs to the wild
<p></p><p>Eulogy for <strong>Nature</strong>:
</p><p>To Mother Nature,
</p><p>You are a gift that God created with varieties of color and life, from little living creatures up to the ignorant humans. You shine with beauty and peacefulness, with every tree that blew through your breeze and those waves in every ocean. You are part of every one of us whether we are from different countries and from different nations. You make us think that we always have one in common with everyone.
</p><p>For every boat that safely got back from the sea; for every hungry human you give them fruits and berries. The leaves that grow in every tree and its shade, the sunlight gently passing through every color of flowers and leaves. The weather that enables us to grow crops and more trees.
</p><p>You gave us more than we deserved and more than we asked for, yet we still weren’t content. We took for granted your blessing to us, the life you make us and the other creatures too. We sought power and more land to conquer and improve wealth we lost touch of what was fading. But I believe that even though we continue to hurt you, even more, you still are forgiving and will start a new.
</p><p>To the nature that never ceased to amaze us.
</p><p>From a tiny human,

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Brainstorm Ideas for the Eulogy</p><p></p><p>Before you start writing a eulogy, brainstorm ideas for points to include in your speech and get organized.</p><p></p><p>2. Write the Eulogy’s Introduction</p><p></p><p> Use this template for writing the 1st paragraph of the eulogy.</p><p>In the opening statement, acknowledge why everybody is gathered—i.e. to celebrate the life of the deceased and to say goodbye.</p><p></p><p>3. Write a Short Biography of the Deceased’s Life</p><p></p><p>For paragraphs 2 to 5 of the eulogy, give the funeral guests a short overview about the deceased’s life by using this template:</p><p>First discuss when and where the deceased was born, who was in his or her birth family, significant family events, and any other interesting family details. </p><p>For example:</p><p></p><p>“John was born on December 12, 1952, in the small town of Smithville, Idaho.  His parents, Wilma and Fred Smith, settled in the town in 1939 and were corn farmers.  John was the oldest of five boys, Fred, Lincoln, Garry and Paul.  The family suffered a devastating loss in 1960 when Lincoln died from polio.”</p><p></p><p>4. Include Special Memories, Stories, and Qualities of the Deceased in the Eulogy</p><p></p><p>For paragraphs 6 to 9 of the eulogy, share special memories and stories about the deceased.  Use this template to cover these topics:</p><p>After you have covered biographical information about the deceased is the time to delve into  any special memories or stories.</p><p>You can use some humour here, if you wish.  But be careful to use humour that is appropriate for the occasion and that others will find tasteful.</p><p>For example:</p><p></p><p>“My dad would always volunteer to be the coach for our football team.  We loved going camping and fishing with him on the weekends, though we spent more time joking around than actually catching any fish.  Family was the most important thing to my dad.  He would always say, “Family will always be there to watch your back, so be nice to your brothers!”</p><p></p><p>5. Close the Eulogy With Words of Comfort and a Final Goodbye</p><p></p><p>For paragraph 10 of the eulogy—the final paragraph—give the congregation some words of comfort to dwell on using template.</p><p>Talk about the lessons that the deceased taught you and how he or she impacted your life.   </p><p>For example:</p><p></p><p>“Emily taught me to work hard, be kind to others, and never take life too seriously.  Her humour, selflessness and kindness will continue to inspire those who had the privilege of knowing her.”</p><p></p><p>6. Proofread the Eulogy</p><p></p><p>You need to proofread your eulogy a couple of times to ensure that all the information is correct and that it strikes the right tone.</p><p>It would be best to have a trusted family member or friend check it for you also to ensure that the facts are correct, that your humour is not too much, and that it is well written.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
