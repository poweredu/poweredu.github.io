There are many types of potential energy and one of which is gravitational potential energy which is the potential energy with respect to the object's position. This is affected by the mass of the object (m), height (h), and pull of gravity (g), thus, having the formula PE =mgh. In the question, substituting the values to the formula will give us the book's potential energy. The unit of potential energy is Joules (J) which is equivalent to Newton meter (Nm).

To solve the velocity, we need to derive the formula for v.

Specifically, the <strong>speed of sound depends on the temperature</strong> and sometimes humidity. Since sound possesses kinetic energy, thus, the temperature affects the speed of sound. It is because, at higher temperatures, molecules move and vibrate faster making sound waves travel faster. To get the speed of sound at a certain temperature, the following formula is used: v = 331 [tex]\frac{m}{s}[/tex] + (0.6 [tex]\frac{m}{s}[/tex] ) (T in °C), where T is the temperature in ° Celsius. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><br />
