The story follows a woman who is confined to a room by her husband, a physician, who believes that she is suffering from a nervous condition. The room has yellow wallpaper, which the narrator becomes obsessed with and begins to see as a living entity. As the story progresses, the narrator's mental health deteriorates, and she becomes increasingly isolated and delusional.</p><p></p><p>The story is often interpreted as a critique of the medical treatment of women during the 19th century, particularly the "rest cure" that was popularized by Dr. Silas Weir Mitchell. The rest cure involved complete rest and isolation, which often did more harm than good. The story also speaks to the theme of patriarchal oppression, as the narrator is stripped of her agency and her voice by her husband and is ultimately pushed to the brink of insanity.</p><p></p><p>The use of first-person narration is central to the story's effectiveness. The reader is given a direct insight into the narrator's thoughts and feelings, which become increasingly disjointed and erratic as the story progresses. The use of symbolism is also significant, as the yellow wallpaper comes to represent the narrator's confinement and oppression.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "The Yellow Wallpaper" is a powerful and disturbing story that highlights the dangers of patriarchal power structures and the medical mistreatment of women during the 19th century. The story remains relevant today as a reminder of the importance of agency and autonomy in the face of oppressive systems.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: The story entitled “The Mats” was written by Francisco Arcellana, one of the admirable literary Filipino artists. The story talks about a typical Filipino family culture, that portrays the close family relationship, respect for the elders and remembering the family members who passed away.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>            The story begins with the homecoming of Mr. Angeles who came from Mariveles. He wrote a letter for his family about the real weaver artist who make a marvelous mats. Apparently, he would bring home his family some mats from this mat weaver.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>            Knowing that the rest of the family members will receive their own personalized sleeping mats, they became excited about the news. It was not just an ordinary mat that they would receive but a personalized mat with their names and a color depending on their birthstone. I can sense here, how much joy the kids felt when they heard the news. Giving gifts is part of our tradition when some come back home. This shows how much Mr. Angeles love his family.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>            The mat plays an important role to Emelia and Mr. Angeles, for Nana Emelia received a mat by her mother when she got married to Mr. Angeles. It shows in this story that Filipinos are naturally sentimental. Filipinos always treasure the things we received from our special someone, family, friends, etc. It shows how Filipinos care for that certain thing they received from others.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>            Finally, Mr. Angeles arrived and the kids were excited to received their personalized sleeping mats. Mr. Angeles distributed the mats to his children as he calls the names that’s on the mat. Now they were all done but there are three mats left. Those mats were for their kids who passed away. This only show that even though they’re dead they remain in the heart of their father. So, the story taught us that we should not forget our loved ones no matter how many years had passed. The sleeping mats used as an outlet to pay as a tribute to his three kids who were not with them anymore.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>SHARE THIS:</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Authors often employ figurative language to make unfamiliar objects, settings and situations more relatable. Short stories, in particular, rely heavily on figurative language -- such as similes, metaphors, hyperbole, and personification -- to make the characters and storylines come alive in the reader’s mind.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation: pabrainliest po</strong></p><p></p><br />

Enjoy reading this story.</p><p></p><p>Velan was a carpenter. He was living in a village. His mother dies a long time back. His aged father, Kuppan, lived with Velan. Kuppan was very weak. He could not even walk well. He was so weak. It was because Velan did not give him enough food. He had given his father a small earthen plate. Even a small quantity of rice in the plate appeared to be much. Velan was a bad man. He was a drunkard also. After taking drinks, he abused his father badly.</p><p></p><p>Velan had a son. His name is Muthu. Muthu was just ten years old. He was a very good boy. He loved his grandfather. He had great respect for his grandfather. He did not like his father’s attitude and character, because his father was treating his grandfather cruelly.</p><p></p><p>One day Kuppan was eating his food out of earthen plate that his son had given to him. The earthen plate fell down. The plate broke into pieces. The food also fell on the floor. Velan was working at the other end of the room. He saw the broken plate. He was very angry with his father and used very harsh words to abuse his father. The old man felt bad about what happened. He was sorry for his mistake. Velan’s words wounded him very deeply.</p><p></p><p>Velan’s son, Muthu, saw this. He did not like his father. His father was ill-treating his grandfather. He was afraid to speak against his father.

He worked with the tools to make a wooden plate. His father saw him working.</p><p></p><p>“What are you making, Muthu?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>“I am making a wooden plate!" replied Muthu.</p><p></p><p>“A wooden plate! What for?" asked his father.</p><p></p><p>“I am making it for you, father. When you grow old, like my grandfather, you will need a plate for food. A plate made from earth mat break very easily. Then I may scold you severely. So, I want to give you a wooden plate. It may not break so easily."</p><p></p><p>The carpenter was shocked to hear this. Only now he realized his mistake. His father was kind to Velan He had looked after Velan very well. Now, he was old. Velan was treating his father severely. Velan was now very sad about his own behavior. He realized his mistakes. He then became a different person.</p><p></p><p>From that day, Velan treated his father with great respect. He gave up drinking too. Velan learnt a lesson from his own son.</p><p></p><p>You should honor your parents at all times. It is your duty. It brings you their blessings.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>di ko Alam Kung ganyan ba ang tinutukoy mo sorry nalang Kung mali</p><br />

You may choose to focus exclusively on comparing, exclusively on contrasting, or on both-or your instructor may direct you to do one or both.</p><p></p><p>First, pick useable subjects and list their characteristics. In fact, their individual characteristics determine whether the subjects are useable. After that, choose a parallel pattern of organization and effective transitions to set your paper above the merely average.</p><p></p><p>1. Picking a subject</p><p>Focus on things that can obviously be compared or contrasted. For instance, if you are examining an idea (political or philosophical) examine the opposite of that idea. Or, if you are examining a person, like a president, pick another president for comparison or contrast. Don't try to compare a president and a cab driver, or existentialism and a legislative bill on car tax refunds.</p><br />

                            20. Story analysis The Monkey's PawShort story by W.W. Jacobs​</h2><br />
                        <p>"The Monkey's Paw" is a short story by W.W. Jacobs that explores the theme of the consequences of desire and the dangers of interfering with fate. The story follows the White family, who come into possession of a monkey's paw that is said to grant three wishes. Despite warnings from a previous owner of the paw, Mr. White decides to make a wish for a sum of money, which sets in motion a chain of events that leads to tragedy and despair.</p><p></p><p>The story is structured in three parts, each representing a wish granted by the paw. The first wish results in the death of the White's son, Herbert, who is killed in a work accident and whose body is mutilated beyond recognition. The second wish is made by Mrs. White, who wishes for her son to be brought back to life. However, the consequences of this wish are even more horrific, as the revived Herbert is a twisted and grotesque version of his former self, causing Mrs. White to flee in terror.</p><p></p><p>The third and final wish is left unspoken, as Mr. White realizes the danger of interfering with fate and chooses to destroy the paw. However, it is too late, as the damage has already been done, and the Whites are left to live with the consequences of their desires.</p><p></p><p>Jacobs uses a range of literary techniques to create a sense of foreboding and tension throughout the story. The setting, a cold and dark night in a remote location, adds to the atmosphere of suspense and unease. The use of foreshadowing, such as the warnings of the previous owner of the paw and the description of Herbert's workplace, creates a sense of inevitability and doom. The paw itself is a powerful symbol of temptation and danger, representing the human desire for power and control.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "The Monkey's Paw" is a cautionary tale about the dangers of meddling with fate and the consequences of unchecked desire. Through its use of suspense, symbolism, and foreshadowing, the story serves as a powerful reminder of the fragility of human life and the limits of human power.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Here's an analysis of the first paragraph of "The Wedding Dance" short story:</p><p></p><p>The first paragraph of "The Wedding Dance" by Amador Daguio sets the scene for the story and introduces the main characters. The paragraph describes the setting as a "square" in a "mountain village," with the "bright noonday sun" shining down on the people gathered there. The author also mentions the presence of music and dancing, which creates a festive atmosphere. The two main characters, Awiyao and Lumnay, are introduced through their actions and physical descriptions. Awiyao is described as a strong and handsome man, while Lumnay is portrayed as a woman who is "too near-sighted" to join in the dancing. This sets up a contrast between the two characters, with Awiyao being physically capable and confident while Lumnay is physically limited and socially isolated from the festivities. The paragraph also hints at the conflict that will drive the story, as Lumnay looks at Awiyao "with pain in her heart" and thinks about their failed marriage. Overall, the first paragraph effectively establishes the setting, characters, and conflict, drawing the reader into the story and creating a sense of anticipation for what will happen next.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>The short story "A Grain as Big as a Hen's Egg" is a fable that imparts an important lesson about greed and the dangers of seeking more than what we need.</p><p></p><p>The story is about a farmer who discovered a grain as big as a hen's egg in his field. Instead of being content with his good fortune, he became greedy and began to dream of all the wealth and prosperity he could have if he were to sell this enormous grain. He decided to take the grain to the market, but along the way, he met a series of people who convinced him to trade the grain for something even better. Each time he made a trade, he thought he was getting a better deal, but he ended up with nothing in the end.</p><p></p><p>The story is a cautionary tale about how greed can cloud our judgment and lead us down a dangerous path. It shows how easy it is to get caught up in the desire for more and lose sight of what really matters. The farmer's decision to keep trading the grain for something better is a metaphor for how chasing after wealth and material possessions can leave us with nothing in the end.</p><p></p><p>The story also emphasizes the importance of contentment and gratitude. The farmer had a good harvest, but he couldn't appreciate it because he was focused on what he didn't have. The story encourages us to be happy with what we have and to be grateful for the blessings we already possess.</p><p></p><p>Overall, "A Grain as Big as a Hen's Egg" is a thought-provoking story that teaches an important lesson about the dangers of greed and the value of contentment. It encourages us to appreciate the blessings we have, rather than always seeking more, and reminds us that true wealth comes from within</p><br />
