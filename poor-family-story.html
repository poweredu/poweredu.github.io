                            1. describe the poor family in the story "the father goes to court"​</h2><br />
                        In "The Father Goes to Court" by Carlos Bulosan, the poor family is depicted as living in a state of extreme poverty and deprivation. The father, who is the main character, works hard every day as a laborer but is unable to provide for his family's basic needs.<br /><br />The family's home is described as a small, cramped space with a dirt floor. They have no furniture aside from a few wooden crates that serve as chairs and a table. The walls of the house are made of bamboo and coconut leaves, and the roof is made of nipa palm leaves.<br /><br />The family's clothing is old and tattered, and they cannot afford to buy new clothes. The children, who are malnourished and sickly, do not attend school because the family cannot afford the fees and the necessary supplies.<br /><br />Despite their poverty, the family is depicted as being proud and dignified. They do not beg for money or handouts, but instead try to make do with what little they have. The father, in particular, is determined to provide for his family and works hard to earn a living, even though he is often exploited and mistreated by his employers.<br /><br />Overall, the poor family in "The Father Goes to Court" is a poignant portrayal of the struggles faced by many Filipino families during the early 20th century.<br />

Despite her luxurious lifestyle, she always had a soft spot for the less fortunate and always went out of her way to help them. One day, while wandering around the town, she met a poor maid who was struggling to make ends meet. The maid's hard life touched the princess's heart, and she decided to take her under her wing and make her a part of her family.</p><p></p><p>Middle:</p><p></p><p>As the days passed, the princess and the maid became good friends. The maid was amazed at the princess's generosity and kindness towards everyone, regardless of their status in society. One day, while the maid was out, she met a beggar who was in dire need of help. Despite her own poverty, the maid offered the beggar food and shelter. The beggar was actually a good witch in disguise, and she was impressed by the maid's selflessness and kind heart. The witch decided to help the maid and the princess in their quest to help the poor and the needy in the town.</p><p></p><p>Together, the princess, the maid, and the witch worked tirelessly to improve the lives of the people in the town. They provided food, shelter, and clothing to the poor, and their efforts brought joy and happiness to everyone. However, there was an evil witch who was jealous of the princess's popularity and was determined to ruin her happiness.</p><p></p><p>Ending:</p><p></p><p>The evil witch used her dark powers to cast a spell on the princess, causing her to fall into a deep sleep. The witch hoped that the princess would never wake up and that her kingdom would fall into chaos. However, the good witch came to the rescue and used her magic to break the spell. The princess woke up, and with the help of her friends, she defeated the evil witch.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the princess, the maid, and the witch lived happily ever after. Their friendship grew stronger, and their love for the poor and the needy continued to inspire others. The town prospered, and there was joy and happiness all around. The princess realized that true happiness comes not from material possessions but from the love and support of friends and family.</p><br />

                        The rich man filed a complaint against the poor man's family because he believed that the son of the poor man stole his rooster. Despite the lack of evidence, the rich man wanted to punish the family for the alleged crime.The father, in order to compensate for the alleged crime, brought a white rooster to the rich man as a gesture of peace and goodwill. The rich man was pleased with this and withdrew the complaint.The societal conflict or issue presented in the story is the inequality between the rich and the poor. The rich man had power and influence that he used to oppress the poor man's family without any proof of their guilt.The rich man and the poor man's family were different in terms of their economic status and power. The rich man had wealth and influence, while the poor man's family struggled to make ends meet and lacked power and resources.The moral of the story is that justice is not always served in a fair and impartial manner. The rich man used his power to oppress the poor man's family without any proof of their guilt. The father's act of bringing a white rooster as a peace offering is a symbol of his willingness to find a peaceful resolution to the conflict despite the injustice that was done to his family. The story highlights the importance of being just and fair, regardless of one's social status or economic standing.<br />

                            27.

                        <p>1. A poor family is described as struggling financially and living a simple life, while a rich family is rich and lives in luxury.</p><p></p><p>2. The irony of the story is that, although the rich man's family is doing well financially, they are not happy and still feel the need to take advantage of the poor man's family. On the other hand, despite the economic difficulties, the poor man's family is content and happy.</p><p></p><p>3. The complaint of a wealthy neighbor who voluntarily lent money to his poor father and repaid it on time is not entirely justified. The only problem was that payments were made in small amounts, but the rich man did not set any repayment terms.</p><p></p><p>4. The way the poor father pays the rich is only because he paid on time and according to their covenant. It is unfair and unreasonable for a rich neighbor to demand full payment immediately, regardless of the poor person's financial situation.</p><p></p><p>5. Social justice is reflected in the story by describing the family of the poor man, who appears content and happy despite economic difficulties. The story emphasizes the importance of treating others fairly and not taking advantage of the underprivileged. It also emphasizes the need for empathy and understanding towards people in difficult situations.</p><br />
