                                            Hello I will be sending little parts of my essay for people to correct, I want it to be perfect for my teacher to understand why they are so important to me.
All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals that have made me the person I am today.
	One of these amazing goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense obviously, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a very fun sport to do. With all of this information, I think you can conclude that this sport is very important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</a>

Our today's occasion is an outstanding event for all of us as another academic year has come to an end. This means that another group of students graduate from our school and is to start its way into the 'adult life'. 1) ______, this 'adult life' seems to be less appealing and more terrifying with its close oncoming. 2) ____, there are a few important things I am eager to tell our graduates. 3) _____is: do not be afraid of the changes that come to your life; they are crucial, unpredictable, and overwhelming but you are able to deal with them. 4) ______, just built your own way and remember that your families and friends are always there to provide you with any needed support. 5). ______, please, keep in mind the fact that we are graduating after you and look up for you as the examples and inspirations, so, do not be up to anything you would not like us to do. I believe that would be the most suitable advice and recommendation you can hear from someone my age. 6) ________, follow always unto what you really want. 7) _______, I would like to highlight is the crucial value of your dreams as, like the great Steve Jobs pointed out, the way to success is to "dream bigger", and this tool is available for everyone. There has barely been one person in the world that had never failed, so, you, most probably, will not become such an exception. 8)_______, do not limit yourself by the fear of losing, you will lose one day anyway, and this occasion is unpredictable and unpreventable. It may sound absolutely discouraging but have a think about it: if there is nothing to hold you back, everything is possible. With this in mind, make a bold, confident, and reckless step in the life, hurry to fall, 9)_________ the sooner you will do this, the more time you will have for getting back to the top. 10)________ do not let the obstacles and failures stop you as they are just other twists of a great life adventure you are to embark on and we are looking forward to witness. Thank you and congratulations!​</a>

                                            Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</a>

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</a>

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</a>

All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals. That has made me the person I am today.
	One of these goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden. I enjoy TKD because it has taught me honesty, integrity, perseverance, self-control, an indomitable spirit, and most importantly, confidence. The dojang has taught me self-defense, and I have stuck to it for many years. It is important to me because the people there have kept me going. Also, it is a fun sport to do. With all of this information, you can conclude that this sport is important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</a>

All my life I have loved doing many things, but only a few amazing things have turned into big goals that have made me the person I am today.
	One of these amazing goals is in TKD. I have enjoyed doing TKD since I was in the kinder garden.

With all of this information, I think you can conclude that this sport is very important to me. Since you probably understand now why I picked this sport. Even though I am very good and have my black belt, my journey will not stop there. I want to continue helping at the dojang, And go up in ranks. That is my current goal for TKD for now.</h2><br />

What I am talking about here is my first hike in the mountains. ___2.Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and more compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future.___3. Though cell phones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating, distracting students by the possibility to access the internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally, cell phones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon as cyberbullying. ___4. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska. America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old. George and Terry, my two best friends and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day, I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn.___5. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 ( Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses.

                            10. Do not envy those people who were born great but rather, make yourself great through hardwork. Perhaps, we all grow through the process. Just like the flower, it needs proper care, right amount of water until it grows and becomes a beautiful flower that everyone will admire it. And you, you are like a flower who grows every single day of your life. You are like an art that even it is not colourful and it is just simple, you can still call it a masterpiece. You are flawed by design, your imperfections is what makes you perfect. You deserve all the love and not to be swathe by dilemmas, that even though you were destructed by many, loving yourself is still eternity.I used to envy someone people for the fact that they have the things that I want. Will they call me plagiarist for the fact that I am trying to copy them because all people love them? Will they sue me for committing mistake and that is to hate someone because of too much envious of that person? Because of toxic high standards in our society I became someone that isn’t really me. And I realized something, as I keep on growing each day, starting to comprehend things everyday. I realized that—Never let their wordsmakes you doubt aboutyourself and change you.Never let their glancemakes you scared of them.Never let them take offyour self-confidence.And never let them controlyour decisions in life.“Do not change yourself for others and let others change for you. You don't need to adjust yourself just to fit yourself with them.”Today, I woke up loving thyself— negative thoughts already left and I am embracing myself for who really I am. Today, I’m starting to do what I really want for myself and what really makes me happy. I don’t need wings to fly because I am already a fairy, achieving my goals in life with my own hand. I don't need super power to attain everything that I want because I’ve realized that myself will never leave me and I don’t need someone for I have myself. Today, I don’t need to envy those perfect character in the noble that I always read, I became happy in my life knowing that I am the leading lady of my own story.I’ve realized that I don’t need someone to fulfill the things that I want because I have me. I am the writer of my life and I am the one who’s doing my fate. Today, I am looking at the mirror, I’m happy knowing that this is me, the someone that I used to hate before is now loving herself for who really she was.​</h2><br />

In my life, young as I am, I have experienced the difficulty of being left alone and continued dreaming for the possibility in life. I struggled to the realization of my dreams. When I was in elementary, I have dreamed of becoming a teacher. To teach students of things their parents have forgotten to teach the good things like virtues, values,and ways of life. At present, I am pursuing the dreams I have dreamed of since I was in elementary. I have become who I am today it is because of the passion I have and motivated to achieve what I wanted in life. In my future endeavor, I am assured that I can make my dreams a reality. I enrolled in a college institution where doubt arise, asking myself if I couldfinish my college course without any conflict. To my dismay, there it goes again, the problem with financial matters will not leave me. I was able to combat this battle by praying that everything will be possiblebecause at that time my father has no job and could not support my schooling. Until such time my mother decided to work in Manila to support my studies. And to make my story short, I graduated with flyingcolors because of the perseverance and struggles I have encountered. I do believe that every pain we have suffered in the past will be changed by the realization of what we really desire in life. As I continued to face what will become of my life in the future, I prayed that everything will be a dream to success. I see my life as a wheel that continued to spin trying to look for myfortune. The reason for all these is the Passion and will power that I invested within myself to attain the goals I have bestowed in mind. In becoming a person with virtue and perseverance, I look up to the highestpower that he is the reason for all the blessings I got since then. I can compare my life to a star that shines brightly in the dark cold night, its sparks and lights lighted the world to show that he is not tired ofgiving off his light to people and things below to light their path through the realization of their dreams. Just like a star, I started as a gas cloud and ended asa star remnant that if I will apply this to my real-life situation, the person whose dreams have never shined before, continued to travel along the way to find the light that she is searching for. The gas cloud is mydream, and the star remnant is the realization of that dream. Explanation:The story of my life is a story of failures and success. A story of determination and perseverance that whatever we have in the past, would be connected to our present and future endeavor. The dreams that we have bestowed within ourselves is the dream we realized in the coming years as we continued chasing for them. There was this saying that goes, " Whatever we have attained in the present it will be connected in the past because the past is the important events in our life because we learn from it, to accept our present we must divine our past and accept thefuture".​</h2><br />

Perhaps, since I am a high school student, somebody might say that I have my entire life ahead of me, with all of its beautiful experiences. But despite being so young, I already have a personal breathtaking experience, which, I am sure I will carry with me until my last days. What I am talking about here is my first hike to the mountains. *7. Sexuality education may even cause harm because of the distorted and biased views about premarital contact. It is time to give students more comprehensive and compendious sex education programs that will better prepare them for the future. *8. Though cellphones are necessary for high school students in terms of their safety, they should still be prohibited from use in school. This concept is founded on several reasons, such as disrupting the educational process and facilitating students’ cheating; distracting students by the possibility to access the Internet, social media, or communicate with friends; finally cellphones contribute to the spreading of the social phenomenon known as cyber bullying. *9. The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east of the Yellow Sea,travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall.According to the conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s lengths is approximately 2400 miles. Its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet. For many centuries, the Great Wall has been considered one of the world’s wonders. (Turnbull &amp; Noon, 2007). *10. Historically, the word Halloween is a contraction from the phrase All Hollows Even, which meant the day before All Hollows Day. It is a Catholic holiday dedicated to the commemoration of saints and martyrs for faith; today, though, we know it more as a holiday of trick-or-treating, scary costumes, and entourage, and funny pranks. Gradually, Halloween has lost its religious connotations, and has turned onto a holiday gladly celebrated by youth and adults across the Western world on October 31. *11. When we take into account how many celebrities used illegal drugs, how unstable their family lives are, and how much crime they commit, we can infer that celebrities should not be celebrated as they are. It is in my opinion that celebrities are worse off than non-celebrities – we should instead honor ourselves with self-esteem, self-confidence and self-reliance. We do not need to look up to famous individuals who can be termed by-and-large as criminals, illegal drug users, and down-and-out family members. Despite the veil of their success, on the whole, they are rather miserable examples of human beings that should not be given the honor they have incurred. *12. It was the 4th of July in blistering Nebraska, America’s Independence Day. As usual on every Independence Day since I was five years old, George and Terry, my two best friends, and I went on a picnic. I diligently carried out my household chores, packed my picnic bag, and off I went to collect my friends by way of a bicycle. It is going to be an awesome day. I thought to myself as I sped down my neighborhood street on my beat-up blue Schwinn. *13. Antibiotics were invented by Alexander Flemming in 1928 (Diggins). Antibiotics are chemical substances produced by various microorganisms and other living systems, and capable of inhibiting the growth of dangerous bacteria and viruses. Before the epoch of antibiotics began, there was not much that could be done for patients suffering from different infections, and death rates were not much higher than today. *14. Living in the city is hard, even for those who were born in the industrialized environment of crowded streets, huge supermarkets, crammed subways, and polluting factories. I was born and raised in Dallas, so I know first-hand about heavy traffic and five-level interchange roads. *15. Terrorists cannot continue their actions if they are prosecuted and detained. Grounds for criminal prosecution include UN security Council resolutions and outstanding U.S. indictments (Scheffer, 2001).Circumstances surrounding the attempted use of these grounds to prosecute terrorists activities are not always favorable. * ​</h2><br />
