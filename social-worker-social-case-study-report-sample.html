                        <p>I do not have access to a specific case or scenario to which I can provide a detailed response. However, as a general guide, here are some principles and legal bases that social workers commonly apply in their practice:</p><p></p><p>Respect for the dignity and worth of the person: Social workers recognize and respect the inherent value and worth of every person, and strive to promote the well-being and self-determination of individuals, families, and communities. This principle is enshrined in the Code of Ethics of the National Association of Social Workers (NASW) and is also reflected in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and various national and international laws.</p><p></p><p>Confidentiality: Social workers respect the privacy and confidentiality of their clients, and only share information with others when it is necessary to protect the client or others from harm, or when required by law. Confidentiality is a fundamental principle in social work practice, and is also protected by various laws and regulations, such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) in the United States.</p><p></p><p>Social justice: Social workers recognize and address systemic and institutional inequalities and work to promote social justice and human rights. This principle is based on the understanding that social, economic, and political factors can have a significant impact on the well-being and opportunities of individuals and communities. The principle of social justice is also reflected in various national and international laws and policies, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p></p><p>Empowerment: Social workers support and empower their clients to make informed decisions and take action to improve their lives. This principle is based on the belief that individuals have the right to self-determination and that social workers can serve as advocates and allies to help them achieve their goals. Empowerment is also reflected in various laws and policies, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</p><p></p><p>In summary, social workers apply various principles in their practice, such as respect for the dignity and worth of the person, confidentiality, social justice, and empowerment. These principles are based on ethical standards, legal requirements, and a commitment to promoting the well-being and self-determination of individuals, families, and communities.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Top 10 Social Work Interview Questions and Answers</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>While you can never really know what to expect from a job interview, the least you can do is brace yourself for the most common questions you might be asked. If you’re struggling to find the answers or you don’t really know how to put them into words, have no fear! We’ve listed the top 10 social work interview questions and answers so you can truly prepare yourself and have your responses ready ahead of the big day.</p><p></p><p>1. ‘What made you go into social work?’</p><p>Employers want to hear more than just ‘I have a desire to help others’. Most importantly, refrain from saying it’s because you graduated in this field. Instead, reveal your commitment to the job and how much you believe social work is essential to society. Perhaps bring up a personal story and explain what led you to choose this profession. Sample answer: ‘I want to make a difference in the lives of maltreated children. I see and hear about the challenges they face every day in abusive/unhealthy households, and I want to be the one to improve this situation. Being a child protection social worker can help me help them find the right direction in life. I thrive to not only help but also empower, motivate and advocate for this target group.’</p><br />
