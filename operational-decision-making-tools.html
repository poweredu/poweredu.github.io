What are the various uses of horizontal analysis in assisting in decision maker in making  sound decision? 3.

As a learner, why study the various limitations of financial analysis?                       5. Why do we have to analyze the financial statement?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>1. Vertical analysis of an income statement helps the decision-maker by expressing each line item as a percentage of a particular reference point, such as net sales or total revenue. This analysis helps identify the proportion of revenue that is spent on various expenses, such as cost of goods sold, operating expenses, and interest expenses. Decision-makers can use this information to identify areas where cost savings could be realized or where revenue growth is possible, and make informed decisions accordingly.</p><p></p><p>2. Horizontal analysis is a comparison of financial data over a period of time, such as multiple years. The various uses of horizontal analysis in assisting decision-makers in making sound decisions include tracking the company's financial performance, identifying areas where the business needs to improve or invest, and making informed financial decisions based on trends in financial ratios or line items over time. This analysis can help decision-makers understand the trend in various financial ratios or line items over time, highlight areas where the business is experiencing growth or decline, and detect financial red flags.</p><p></p><p>3. Ratio analysis is an analytical tool that helps decision-makers assess the financial performance and efficiency of a company. It involves calculating various financial ratios, such as profitability ratios, liquidity ratios, and leverage ratios. These ratios can help decision-makers compare the company's financial performance against industry standards, identify areas where the company is strong or weak, and monitor changes in the company's financial health over time. Ratio analysis can help decision-makers make informed decisions about investing, financing, and managing the company's operations.</p><p></p><p>4. Studying the various limitations of financial analysis is important for learners because it helps them understand the potential weaknesses of financial analysis tools and the risks of relying solely on financial data to make decisions. Some limitations of financial analysis include the use of historical data, the possibility of manipulation or fraud, and the limitations of financial ratios in capturing the full picture of a company's financial health. Understanding these limitations can help learners approach financial analysis with a critical eye and use multiple sources of information to make informed decisions.</p><p></p><p>5. Analyzing financial statements is essential because it provides decision-makers with important information about a company's financial health and performance. Financial statements provide a snapshot of the company's financial situation at a particular point in time, including its assets, liabilities, and equity. This information helps decision-makers evaluate the company's ability to generate profits, manage its expenses, and meet its financial obligations. Analyzing financial statements can help decision-makers make informed decisions about investing, financing, and managing the company's operations.</p><p></p>Pa brainly if you don't mind<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The nonprofit Center for Audit Quality explains auditor independence: “Auditors’ independence from company management is essential for a successful audit because it enables them to approach the audit with the necessary professional skepticism.”1 The center goes on to identify a key practice to protect independence by which an external auditor reports not to a company’s management, which could make it more difficult to maintain independence, but to a company’s audit committee. The audit committee oversees the auditors’ work and monitors disagreements between management and the auditor about financial reporting. Internal auditors of a company are not the auditors that provide an opinion on the financial statements of a company. According to the Center for Audit Quality, “By law, public companies’ annual financial statements are audited each year by independent auditors—accountants who examine the data for conformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP).”2 The opinion from the independent auditors regarding a publicly traded company is filed for public inspection, along with the financial statements of the publicly traded company.</p><br />
