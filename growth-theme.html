You'll be graded using the rubries written on the latter part of the module Biology, also referred as Biological Science or Life Science deals with the study of living organisms it is divided into subdisciplinen. As a broad discipline, biologists use the term unifying themes where the study is being anchored. The major unifying themes that were mentioned include the cell theory as a description of living systems, continuity of life as explained by the molecular basis of inheritance, the interdependence of structure and function, the diversity of life brought by evolution, unity of living systems as explained by evolutionary conservations, and emergent properties that arise from the organization of life. Describe each unifying theme illustrated below. Oive details on how these themes serve as the foundation in the study of biology 1.

Organisms'function, structures, growth and origin are indeed one of many diverse topics thatshould be explored to grasp the complexities of life. Generally, the followingstatements provide key concepts on the unifying themes in the study of life.1. Biology is about the study of life.2. The unifying themes connect the different subdisciplines that make upbiology as a science.3. The unifying themes of biology comprise the cell theory as a description ofliving systems, continuity of life, interdependence of function and structure,​</a>

After this activity, you are expected to be able to determine the themes of biology as they relate to the properties of life.Materials: mung bean seeds Pot Soil Measuring tools Other materials (as needed by the experiment design)Procedure: 1. Propose a hypothesisFrom common knowledge, you already have an idea as to what plants need to grow healthy, like water and sunlight. Think of other factors or substances that will affect plant growth (suggestions: type of soil, fertilizer type, music or human voice). Choose a variable, and then propose a hypothesis about how the presence and absence of that factor affects the growth or survival of a plant. 2. Conduct your experiment a. Outline the steps of your experiment. Identify the variable and controls in your experiment. NOTE: There should only be one experimental variable – the presence or absence of the factor you are testing.b. Determine the time period for your experiment. c. Specify the data that you will observe in the experimental and control setups. Choose the data that can be accurately measured and compared. d. Conduct your experiment and record your observations. 3. Analyze your dataa. Compare the measured data from the experimental and control plants. b. Organize your data into a table. c. Make a graph to display your results.4. Draw conclusion Did the presence of your experimental variable make a difference in the growth of the experimental and control plants? Was the effect more or less than you had proposed? Pahelp po please.. ​</a>

                        UNIFYING THEME: FOUNDATION IN THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY<p>1. <strong>Growth and development continuity of Life</strong></p><p>                Life is a continuous process, together with this, all living things will grow and develop continuously through time. Life ends, life starts, hence life is a cycle. </p><p>                Humans will grow in many aspects -- physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. As we, humans are growing we are also developing. When humans mature, we develop lot of things, in physical aspect, the development involve changes in our body, motor skills, and senses. Mental skills or cognitive growth involves our ability to learn, our memories, thinking, and reasoning. As we are continuing to grow, there are also development or changes in our emotions, the way we act to our experiences, and on how we handle and interpret different feelings.</p><p>                  All living things, not only us humans are growing and developing. Plants and animals also, even bacteria and viruses are evolving. Because that's how life is -- through reproduction and death, life will come and go, will grow and develop and will eventually die, but the continuity of life will never end, as it is passed through one generation to another. </p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Organization of life acquire and process energy​</strong></p><p><strong>                  </strong>All processes require and process energy. A give and take relationship. Life needs energy to survive, and gives off energy to help others to live. These life processes are done and needed by different life organizations, from cells, organs, organisms, human, animals, plants, ecosystems, communities, and the whole biosphere. </p><p>                  The most obvious explanation or example on how life organization acquire and process energy is the process of respiration. Cellular respiration is the process by which organisms, for example, us humans, use oxygen to break down food molecules to get chemical energy for cell functions, carbon dioxide is released in this process and it is needed to process plant's food through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis acquires light energy from the sun and transform it to chemical energy. These two processes that involve different organization of life are working together in order to survive, thus, they acquire and process energy altogether.</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</strong></p><br />

Research Title: The psychological experience of caregivers of COVID-19 patientsB. Summary of Findings: The psychological experience of nurses caring for COVID-19 patients can be summarizedinto 4 themes. First, negative emotions present in early stage consisting of fatigue, discomfort, and helplessness wascaused by high-intensity work, fear and anxiety, and concern for patients and family members. Second, self-copingstyles included psychological and life adjustment, altruistic acts, team support, and rational cognition. Third, wefound growth under pressure, which included increased affection and gratefulness, development of professionalresponsibility, and self-reflection. Finally, we showed that positive emotions occurred simultaneously with negativeemotions.C. Your Conclusion:

Generally, the followingstatements provide key concepts on the unifying themes in the study of life.1. Biology is about the study of life.2. The unifying themes connect the different subdisciplines that make upbiology as a science.3.

                        <p>Biology is the science that studies life. What exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious answer, but it is not easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life.</p><p></p><p>From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared properties that make something “alive”? How do those various living things function? When faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them? </p><p></p><p>And, finally—what biologists ultimately seek to understand—how did this diversity arise and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.</p><p></p><p>(Welcome na po agad!) :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Biology is the science that studies life. What exactly is life? This may sound like a silly question with an obvious answer, but it is not easy to define life. For example, a branch of biology called virology studies viruses, which exhibit some of the characteristics of living entities but lack others. It turns out that although viruses can attack living organisms, cause diseases, and even reproduce, they do not meet the criteria that biologists use to define life.</p><p>From its earliest beginnings, biology has wrestled with four questions: What are the shared properties that make something “alive”? How do those various living things function? When faced with the remarkable diversity of life, how do we organize the different kinds of organisms so that we can better understand them?</p><p>And, finally—what biologists ultimately seek to understand—how did this diversity arise and how is it continuing? As new organisms are discovered every day, biologists continue to seek answers to these and other questions.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>IPAG PATULOY MO ANG PAGAARAL MO PARA MAKAPAG TAPOS</p><br />
