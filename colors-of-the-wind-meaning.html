One day, a shoot came out of the side of the Mother Banana tree. He was husky, dark-covered, and thick-leafed. The Mother Banana tree noticed the difference between the newcomer and her other shoots. She said nothing about her impressions. complained, so she gave in to their desire. The other shoots did not keep silent, however. And one of them said: "Move away, you dark one. You are not one of us. You are ugly and not graceful." The little shoot moved some distance away, and there he grew even darker and stronger. One day, the sky grew dark and poured heavy rains. Lightning and thunder broke out. When the strong wind blew hard at the Mother Banana tree and the vain shoots around her, they wailed as her leaves were tattered to pieces. The wind kept blowing harder until the banana family was threatened to be toppled to the ground. The dark-colored shoot, seeing the banana family in peril, uprooted himself from the ground and wound his body around the family, thus saving them. The dark shoot was limp but was still alive when the storm blew over. Filled with remorse, the other shoots shouted to one another, "Habaka, Habaka, "meaning "Lift him, lift him." They lifted him and placed him in a dark place beside them. There he grew strong and sturdy. The Mother Banana pitied the dark-colored shoot and tried to extend her leaves to shade him from the sun. But the other shoots From the wailing of the banana shoots for their dark-colored brother, Habaka," the present "Habaka, name "abaca" was derived. - Compiled by: Damiana Eugeni Philippine Folk Literature, 199​</a>

Love, happiness, joy, excitement, surprise, pain, sadness, disappointment, stress, and so on are represented by these colors. There is no one who is completely content in this world. Everyone has their own set of problems. Some people have issues with their jobs, while others have issues with their relationships. Whether we're talking about health, money, or people, struggles never end. However, how you handle them is entirely up to you. It's up to you whether you let them get the best of you or you turn the tables on them.</p><p></p><p></p><br />

One day, a shoot came out of the side of the Mother Banana tree. He was husky, dark-covered, and thick-leafed. The Mother Banana tree noticed the difference between the newcomer and her other shoots. She said nothing about her impressions. complained, so she gave in to their desire. The other shoots did not keep silent, however. And one of them said: "Move away, you dark one. You are not one of us. You are ugly and not graceful." The little shoot moved some distance away, and there he grew even darker and stronger. One day, the sky grew dark and poured heavy rains. Lightning and thunder broke out. When the strong wind blew hard at the Mother Banana tree and the vain shoots around her, they wailed as her leaves were tattered to pieces. The wind kept blowing harder until the banana family was threatened to be toppled to the ground. The dark-colored shoot, seeing the banana family in peril, uprooted himself from the ground and wound his body around the family, thus saving them. The dark shoot was limp but was still alive when the storm blew over. Filled with remorse, the other shoots shouted to one another, "Habaka, Habaka, "meaning "Lift him, lift him." They lifted him and placed him in a dark place beside them. There he grew strong and sturdy. The Mother Banana pitied the dark-colored shoot and tried to extend her leaves to shade him from the sun. But the other shoots From the wailing of the banana shoots for their dark-colored brother, Habaka," the present "Habaka, name "abaca" was derived. - Compiled by: Damiana Eugeni Philippine Folk Literature, 199​</h2><br />
