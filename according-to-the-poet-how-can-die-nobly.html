Do this in your notebook.If We Must DieBy: Claude McKay (1889–1948)If we must die, let it not be like hogs Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot,  While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs,  Making their mock at our accursèd lot. If we must die, O let us nobly die, So that our precious blood may not be shed In vain; then even the monsters we defy Shall be constrained to honor us though dead! O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe! Though far outnumbered let us show us brave, And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow! What though before us lies the open grave? Like men we’ll face the murderous, cowardly pack, Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back!Questions:1. What do the first four lines establish? 2.

If We Must Die By Claude McKay (1889-1948) If we must die, let it not be like hogs Hunted and penned in an inglorious spot, While round us bark the mad and hungry dogs, Making their mock at our accursed lot. If we must die, o let us nobly die, So that our precious blood may not be shed In vain; then even the monsters we defy Shall be constrained to honor us though dead! O kinsmen! we must meet the common foe! Though far outnumbered let us show us brave, And for their thousand blows deal one death-blow! ! What though before us lies the open grave? Like men we'll face the murderous, cowardly pack, Pressed to the wall, dying, but fighting back! Questions: CLMD 1. What do the first four lines establish? 2. What message does the persona forward to his allies? 3. How does the persona describe his enemies? 4. According to the poet, how can one die nobly? 5.

                        if one person did something great to you, Then you can now just utterly help that person but it must be below your heart for you to help other people. dont wait for an exchange just help him and maybe one day he might help you too :)<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One can die nobly by "dying but fighting back." The author is trying to convince the reader to keep fighting for whatever it is you want. He says that giving up and giving in to things without ever trying it like dying like a hog.</p><p></p><p>hope it helps❤️</p><p></p><p></p><br />

Circles that overlap have a commonality while circles that do not overlap do not share those traits.Venn diagrams help to visually represent the similarities and differences between two concepts. They have long been recognized for their usefulness as educational tools. Since the mid-20th century, Venn diagrams have been used as part of the introductory logic curriculum and in elementary-level educational plans around the world.Applications for Venn DiagramsVenn diagrams are used to depict how items relate to each other against an overall backdrop, universe, data set, or environment. A Venn diagram could be used, for example, to compare two companies within the same industry by illustrating the products both companies offer (where circles overlap) and the products that are exclusive to each company (outer circles). Venn diagrams are, at a basic level, simple pictorial representations of the relationship that exists between two sets of things. However, they can be much more complex. Still, the streamlined purpose of the Venn diagram to illustrate concepts and groups has led to their popularized use in many fields, including statistics, linguistics, logic, education, computer science, and business.Examples of Venn DiagramsA Venn diagram could be drawn to illustrate fruits that come in red or orange colors. Below, we can see that there are orange fruits (circle B) such as persimmons and tangerines while apples and cherries (circle A) come in red colors. Peppers and tomatoes come in both red and orange colors, as represented by the overlapping area of the two circles.<p>꧁༒───────────────────༒꧂</p><p></p><p></p><p>[tex]\rm\blue{\overbrace{\underbrace{\tt\color{pink}{ \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: ✨B.FRANCINE✨\: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: \: }}}}[/tex]</p><p></p><p>#CARRY ON LEARNING</p><p>#BRAINLY</p><p>#BRAINLYPH</p><p></p><br />

                            13. According to the speaker, how should an individual deal with death in the poet crossing the bar?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer&amp;Explanation</strong></p><p>"Crossing the Bar" is a poem by the British Victorian poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson. The poem, written in 1889, is a metaphorical meditation on death, which sees the speaker comparing dying—or a certain way of dying—to gently crossing the sandbar between a coastal area and the wider sea/ocean. In essence, it is a poem that argues that death is in fact a kind of comfort, a point of view based on the speaker's religious faith in the afterlife. Accordingly, the speaker wants to die quietly and gently, without fear, reassured by the knowledge that what comes next is a meeting with God. "Crossing the Bar" was written shortly before Tennyson's own death, and is the poem that Tennyson wanted placed at the end of all future collections and editions of his poetry.</p><p></p><br />
