                        Martin Luther King Jr.:
<p><strong>Martin Luther King Jr.</strong> was <strong>a Baptist minister and a social activist</strong> who have <strong>been famous due to his contribution in the American civil rights movement </strong>from the mid 1950 until the time of his assassination in 1968. He had <strong>sought equality and human rights for the African – Americans, economically disadvantaged, and all other victims of injustices through peaceful protests.  </strong></p><p><strong>Martin Luther King Jr. </strong>was the <strong>motivating force behind the watershed events including the Montgomery Bus Boycott</strong> and the <strong>March in Washington in 1963 </strong>which caused these landmarks to be the place for legislation of the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.
</p>Birth:
<p><strong>Martin Luther King, Jr.</strong> was born on <strong>January 15, 1929, in Atlanta, Georgia,</strong> being the <strong>second child of Martin Luther King Sr., a pastor, and Alberta Williams King, a former schoolteacher.
</strong></p>Education:
Being a gifted student, King attended <strong>isolated public schools</strong> and was admitted to <strong>Morehouse College </strong>at the age of 15. Morehouse College is the alma mater of his father and maternal grandfather. There<strong> he studies law and medicine.</strong> With no plans of following his dad’s footsteps, he had entered the ministry and later changed his mind after being mentored by Morehouse’s president<strong> Dr. Benjamin Mays</strong>. Dr. Mays is <strong>an influential theologian and outspoken advocate for racial equality.
</strong>In <strong>1948</strong>, just after his graduation, <strong>King entered Crozer Theological Seminary in Pennsylvania.</strong> There he earned a Bachelor of Divinity degree, won a prestigious fellowship, and was elected president of his predominantly white senior class. He then enrolled in a graduate program at Boston University, completing his coursework in 1953 and earning a doctorate in systematic theology two years later.
Marriage:
<p>While in <strong>Boston,</strong> Martin<strong> met Coretta Scott</strong>, <strong>a young singer from Alabama </strong>who was <strong>studying at the New England Conservatory of Music.</strong> The couple <strong>went into marriage in 1953</strong> and <strong>settled in Montgomery, Alabama, </strong>where <strong>he became pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church. </strong>The Kings had <strong>four children: Yolanda Denise King, Martin Luther King III, Dexter Scott King and Bernice Albertine King.
</strong></p>Career:
<strong>Martin Luther King Jr. </strong>was chosen as the <strong>protest’s leader and official spokesman.</strong> This was after activists coordinated a bus boycott that would continue for 381 days which is a response to Rosa Parks’ refusal to give up her seat for a white passenger on Montgomery bus and was arrested. The Montgomery Bus Boycott placed a severe economic strain on the public transit system and downtown business owners.  As <strong>SCLC president,</strong> Martin Luther King, Jr. <strong>traveled across the country and around the world,</strong> giving lectures on nonviolent protest and civil rights as well as meeting with religious figures, activists and political leaders.
Later that year, <strong>Martin Luther King, Jr. worked with a number of civil rights and religious groups to organize the March on Washington </strong>for <strong>Jobs and Freedom</strong>, a peaceful political rally designed to shed light on the injustices African Americans continued to face across the country.
Death:
<p><strong>On the evening of April 4, 1968, Martin Luther King was assassinated</strong>. He was <strong>fatally shot </strong>while standing <strong>on the balcony of a motel in Memphis, </strong>where King had traveled to support a sanitation workers’ strike. In the wake of his death, a wave of riots swept major cities across the country, while President Johnson declared a national day of mourning.
