Alan loves to read books. Sometimes, he imagines himself as one of the characters from the book he reads. One night, while he was in his room, he heard a loud bang from the room next door. It was his mini-library.
  	He jumped out of bed and checked the room. When he opened the door, a blinding light came out. After a while, he noticed that he was already in a different place. Books were flying. There were also flying horses and dragons. Humans lived peacefully together with ancient beasts. All the things he read from the books came to life. “Welcome to, Realtasia.
Would you like to have some tour?” a talking cat approached Alan. He happily followed. They walked around the place and Alan was amazed by its beauty.
  	The cat, named Ali, then, guided Alan to the woods where he saw a gigantic tree, as tall as a mountain. Its leaves looked like pages of books, and its branches looked like the skeleton of books. Alan realized that it was the tree that gave life to Realtasia and without it the world would be gone.</a>

Alan loves to read books. Sometimes, he imagines himself as one of the characters from the book he reads. One night, while he was in his room, he heard a loud bang from the room next door. It was his mini-library.
  	He jumped out of bed and checked the room. When he opened the door, a blinding light came out. After a while, he noticed that he was already in a different place. Books were flying. There were also flying horses and dragons. Humans lived peacefully together with ancient beasts. All the things he read from the books came to life. “Welcome to, Realtasia.
Would you like to have some tour?” a talking cat approached Alan. He happily followed. They walked around the place and Alan was amazed by its beauty.
  	The cat, named Ali, then, guided Alan to the woods where he saw a gigantic tree, as tall as a mountain. Its leaves looked like pages of books, and its branches looked like the skeleton of books.
