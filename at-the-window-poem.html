I HEARD A FLY BUZZ- WHEN I DIED
-EMILY DICKINSON

Was like the Stillness in the Air-
Between the Heaves of Storm-
The Eyes around- had wrung them dry
And breaths were gathering firm
For the last Onset - when the King
Be witnessed in the room
I willed my Keepsakes - Signed Away
What Portion of me be
Assignable - and then it was
There interposed a Fly -
With Blue - uncertain - stumbling Buzz
Between the light - and - me
And then the Windows failed - and then
I could not see to see

With Blue - uncertain - stumbling Buzz
Between the light - and - me
And then the Windows failed - and then
I could not see to see
