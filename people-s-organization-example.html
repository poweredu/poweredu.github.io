                                            Learning Opportunity 9 Directions: Read the paragraph and answer the questions below. Despite historic progress on developing new tools to fight COVID-19 including nine vaccines listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use -- inequitable access means the pandemic is actually worse today than it was a year ago. Last December, I wrote about COVID-19's confirmed global death toll of 1.5 million. Just one year later, that number stands in excess of 5 million. So far, the world has delivered 7 billion vaccines and counting, but they are being distributed unequally. According to Our World in Data, more than eight times as many boosters are administered globally every day than are primary doses in low income countries. It is a global injustice, and the most vulnerable people remain the most at risk. Only 1 in 4 health care workers in Africa have been fully vaccinated despite serving on the pandemic's front lines, for example, according to WHO. QUESTIONS 1. What is the main topic of the text? 2.

A tsunami is a fast-moving giant wave traveling towards a coastline which can destroy structures and objects along its way.

No one really knows how big it can grow. A tsunami may also take place during powerful storms such as super typhoons. As strong storms approach, they may push waves to form a tsunami. Because of the destructive power of a tsunami, people must be alert and ready for them.

Despite historic progress on developing new tools to fight COVID-19 including nine vaccines listed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for emergency use -- inequitable access means the pandemic is actually worse today than it was a year ago. Last December, I wrote about COVID-19's confirmed global death toll of 1.5 million. Just one year later, that number stands in excess of 5 million. So far, the world has delivered 7 billion vaccines and counting, but they are being distributed unequally. According to Our World in Data, more than eight times as many boosters are administered globally every day than are primary doses in low income countries. It is a global injustice, and the most vulnerable people remain the most at risk. Only 1 in 4 health care workers in Africa have been fully vaccinated despite serving on the pandemic's front lines, for example, according to WHO. QUESTIONS 1. What is the main topic of the text? 2.

All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter's ider changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is to changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are perman they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter. 3. Dr. Miller doesn't want the tigers to vanish. These majestic beasts are dis alarming rate.

A tsunami is a fast-moving giant wave traveling towards a coastline which can destroy structures and objects along its way. It sometimes happens during a very strong earthquake located out in the sea. Depending on its size, the height of a tsunami may be as tall as an average person or as high as an electric post. No one really knows how big it can grow. A tsunami may also take place during powerful storms such as super typhoons. As strong storms approach, they may push waves to form a tsunami. Because of the destructive power of a tsunami, people must be alert and ready for them.

There should be two to three supporting points: reasons, facts, statistics, quotations, examples, or a mix of these. Both the second and third body sections should follow the same pattern.

You want to make sure you are giving thorough, comprehensive, and clear explanations on the topic. Never assume the reader knows everything about your topic (even if it is covered in the reader’s field of study). For example, even though some of your instructors may teach criminology, they may have specialized in different areas from the one about which you are writing; they most likely have a strong understanding of the concepts but may not recall all the small details on the topic. If your instructor specialized in crime mapping and data analysis for example, he or she may not have a strong recollection of specific criminological theories related to other areas of study. Providing enough background information without being too detailed is a fine balance, but you always want to ensure you have no gaps in the information, so your reader will not have to guess your intention.
