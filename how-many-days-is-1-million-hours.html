EXERCISE 16
1.	The force (F) exerted by an object varies directly as its mass (m). If the force is 20 dynes when the mass is 440 kg., find the force when the mass is 1100 kg.
2.	Hooke’s Law states that the distance (d) that a spring is stretched varies directly as 
the weight (w) on the end of the spring. If the distance is 48 cm. when the weight is 120 gms., find the weight when the distance is 72 cm.
3.	The amount of garbage varies directly as the number of people. If town A (population 50,000) produces 24 tons of garbage in a certain period, how much garbage would town B     (population 2 million) produce in the same time period.
4.	The amount of paper that is recycled varies directly as the acres of land which are saved from logging. If 5 tons of paper is recycled, 120 acres of trees are saved. How many tons of recycled paper are needed to save 300 acres of trees?
5.	Time varies inversely as speed. If it takes 3 hrs. to paddle a certain distance at 5 km. per hour, how long would it take to paddle the same distance at 2 km. per hr.?
6.	The time to complete a job varies inversely as the number of people who are working.
If it takes 7 people 11 days to complete a job, how long would it take 3 people to complete the same job?
7.	The current (I) in an electric circuit varies inversely as the resistance (R). 
If the current is 0.3 amperes when the resistance is 45 ohms, find the resistance when the current is 1.6 amperes.
8.	Time varies inversely as speed. If the speed is 20 km./hr. for a time of 3 hrs., what would be the speed if the time is 30 minutes?

                                            Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.

                                            Activity 15: Speech WritingPlease refer to the Practical Task.GUIDED GENERALIZATIONIdentify what type of speech is used in the following:1.___________________________________________________________________ Did you know that during the first months of 2004, approximately 200 million birds died or were destroyed in attempt to stop the pandemic of avian influenza? Did you hear that United Nations contributor, Dr. David Navarro, estimated the number of possible human casualties as 5 – 150 million people? Are you aware that since its discovery in the 1990”s, the avian flu has been contracted by more than 100 people, and one of them died? (www.speech.guru)2._____________________________________________________________________ I will finish my speech by one of my favourite quotations. It is taken from the book written by a brilliant mathematician who dared to believe in the incredible. You must have read it in your childhood, but I want you to recall, re-evaluate and remember it. “There is no use trying, said Alice; one can’t believe impossible things. I dare say you haven’t had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast” (Louis Carol).3._________________________________________________________________________ The process itself falls into four simple steps. First, ensure that the wide end of the knot is approximately 30 cm lower than the narrow end and cross the wide end over the narrow one. This will create a loop between the collar and your will-be-tie. Pass the wide end through this loop and then down. So the wide end will again be on top of the narrow one4.__________________________________________________________________________How many of you think guns are necessary to protect yourself? Would you feel the same way if you knew how often guns kill children? I don’t think so! Magazines usually tell people how beautiful and powerful guns are, and never mention how many children get hurt by guns every 0day. But I am here to ask all of you to oppose gun ownership because the fact is that guns are a weapon of violence, they take more lives away every year, and they make people blind to the fact they are killing their own children.5.___________________________________________________________________________The term OCD consists of two defining words: obsession and compulsion. As the word “disorder” speaks for itself, defining obsession and compulsion is crucial for understanding this problem. According to the Merriam-? Webster dictionary, obsession is a persistent disturbing pre-occupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling. Compulsion, in its turn, is an irresistible, persistent impulse to perform an act-often to deal with the obsession. An OCD can be defined as a condition of the mind characterized by a constantly repeating intrusive thought, which can be neutralized only by a certain act or ritual (academichelp.net)​</a>

It orbits around the sum of a speed of 18.5miles per second or 67,000 miles per hour. Seventy one percent of the Earth's surface is water: the PacificOcean makes up 70 million squared miles of that coverage. The force of gravity is strong that you would needto travel at a speed at least seven miles per second to escape it. Approximately two million species of animals,plants and other organisms have been identified and named: it is estimated that approximately 50 millionspecies have yet to be identified.If everyone in the United States recycled their newspapers, the lives of 41,000 tress woul be spared. Onesingle tree can detoxify the air of up of to 60 pounds of pollutants. To make an aluminum can from recycledmaterials takes only five percent of the energy normally needed to make acan, an energy savings Of 95%.The energy saved by recycling just one aluminum can is enough to power a television set for three hours.Recycling glass bottles allows the energy consumption for new glass products to be cut in half.Answer the comprehension check.1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Use compound interest formulas</p><p>Savings instruments in which earnings are continually reinvested, such as mutual funds and retirement accounts, use compound interest. The term compounding refers to interest earned not only on the original value, but on the accumulated value of the account.</p><p></p><p>The annual percentage rate (APR) of an account, also called the nominal rate, is the yearly interest rate earned by an investment account. The term nominal is used when the compounding occurs a number of times other than once per year. In fact, when interest is compounded more than once a year, the effective interest rate ends up being greater than the nominal rate! This is a powerful tool for investing.</p><p></p><p>We can calculate the compound interest using the compound interest formula, which is an exponential function of the variables time t, principal P, APR r, and number of compounding periods in a year n:</p><p></p><p>A</p><p>(</p><p>t</p><p>)</p><p>=</p><p>P</p><p>(</p><p>1</p><p>+</p><p>r</p><p>n</p><p>)</p><p>n</p><p>t</p><p>For example, observe the table below, which shows the result of investing $1,000 at 10% for one year.

EXERCISE 16
1.	The force (F) exerted by an object varies directly as its mass (m). If the force is 20 dynes when the mass is 440 kg., find the force when the mass is 1100 kg.
2.	Hooke’s Law states that the distance (d) that a spring is stretched varies directly as 
the weight (w) on the end of the spring. If the distance is 48 cm. when the weight is 120 gms., find the weight when the distance is 72 cm.
3.	The amount of garbage varies directly as the number of people. If town A (population 50,000) produces 24 tons of garbage in a certain period, how much garbage would town B     (population 2 million) produce in the same time period.

                            14. Read here:::::::::::::::::::::::::BATS BY DEBBIE DEANIn the distant past, many people thought bats had magical powers, but times have changed. Today, many people believe that bats are rodents, that they cannot see, and that they are more likely than other animals to carry rabies. All of these beliefs are mistaken. Bats are not rodents, are not blind, and are no more likely than dogs and cats to transmit rabies. Bats, in fact, are among the least understood and least appreciated of animals. Bats are not rodents with wings, contrary to popular belief. Like all rodents, bats are mammals, but they have a skeleton similar to the human skeleton. The bones in bat wings are much like those in arms and the human hand, with a thumb and four fingers. In bats, the bones of the arms and the four fingers of the hands are very long. This bone structure helps support the web of skin that stretches fromthe body to the ends of the fingers to form wings. Although bats cannot see colors, they have good vision in both dim and bright light. Since most bats stay in darkness during the day and do their feeding at night, they do not use their vision to maneuver in the dark but use a process called echolocation. This process enables bats to emit sounds from their mouths that bounce off objects and allow them to avoid the objects when flying. They use this system to locate flying insects to feed on as well. Typically, insect-eating bats emerge at dusk and fly to streams or ponds where they feed. They catch the insects on their wingtip or tail membrane and fling them into their mouths while flying. There are about 1,000 species of bat, ranging in size from the bumblebee bat, which is about an inch long, to the flying fox, which is sixteen inches long and has a wingspan of five feet. Each type of bat has a specialized diet. For seventy percent of bats, the diet is insects. Other types of bats feed on flowers, pollen, nectar, and fruit or on small animals such as birds, mice, lizards, and frogs. One species of bat feeds on the blood of large mammals. This is the common vampire bat, which lives only in Latin America and is probably best known for feeding on the blood of cattle. Unfortunately, in an attempt to control vampire bat populations, farmers have unintentionally killed thousands of beneficial fruit-and insect-eating bats as well. Bats, in fact, perform a number of valuable functions. Their greatest economic value is in eliminating insect pests. Insect- eating bats can catch six hundred mosquitoes in an hour and eat half their body weight in insects every night. In many tropical rain forests, fruit eating bats are the main means of spreading the seeds of tropical fruits. Nectar-feeding bats pollinate a number of tropical plants. If it were not for bats, we might not have peaches, bananas, mangoes, guavas, figs, or dates.Today, the survival of many bat species is uncertain. Sixty percent of bats do not survive past infancy. Some are killed bypredators such as owls, hawks, snakes and other meat-eating creatures, but most are victims of pesticides and other human intrusions. In Carlsbad Caverns, New Mexico, where there were once eight million bats, there are now a quarter million. At Eagle Creek, Arizona, the bat population dropped from thirty million to thirty thousand in six years. Bats often have been burdened with a bad reputation, perhaps because they are not the warm, cuddly sort of animal we love to love. However, their unusual physical features should not lead us to overestimate their harm or to underestimate their value.1. What is the text about?2. Who is the author of the text?3.

                            19. Activity 15: Speech WritingPlease refer to the Practical Task.GUIDED GENERALIZATIONIdentify what type of speech is used in the following:1.___________________________________________________________________ Did you know that during the first months of 2004, approximately 200 million birds died or were destroyed in attempt to stop the pandemic of avian influenza? Did you hear that United Nations contributor, Dr. David Navarro, estimated the number of possible human casualties as 5 – 150 million people? Are you aware that since its discovery in the 1990”s, the avian flu has been contracted by more than 100 people, and one of them died? (www.speech.guru)2._____________________________________________________________________ I will finish my speech by one of my favourite quotations. It is taken from the book written by a brilliant mathematician who dared to believe in the incredible. You must have read it in your childhood, but I want you to recall, re-evaluate and remember it. “There is no use trying, said Alice; one can’t believe impossible things. I dare say you haven’t had much practice, said the Queen. When I was your age, I always did it for half an hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast” (Louis Carol).3._________________________________________________________________________ The process itself falls into four simple steps. First, ensure that the wide end of the knot is approximately 30 cm lower than the narrow end and cross the wide end over the narrow one. This will create a loop between the collar and your will-be-tie. Pass the wide end through this loop and then down. So the wide end will again be on top of the narrow one4.__________________________________________________________________________How many of you think guns are necessary to protect yourself? Would you feel the same way if you knew how often guns kill children? I don’t think so! Magazines usually tell people how beautiful and powerful guns are, and never mention how many children get hurt by guns every 0day. But I am here to ask all of you to oppose gun ownership because the fact is that guns are a weapon of violence, they take more lives away every year, and they make people blind to the fact they are killing their own children.5.___________________________________________________________________________The term OCD consists of two defining words: obsession and compulsion. As the word “disorder” speaks for itself, defining obsession and compulsion is crucial for understanding this problem. According to the Merriam-? Webster dictionary, obsession is a persistent disturbing pre-occupation with an often unreasonable idea or feeling. Compulsion, in its turn, is an irresistible, persistent impulse to perform an act-often to deal with the obsession. An OCD can be defined as a condition of the mind characterized by a constantly repeating intrusive thought, which can be neutralized only by a certain act or ritual (academichelp.net)​</h2><br />

It orbits around the sum of a speed of 18.5miles per second or 67,000 miles per hour. Seventy one percent of the Earth's surface is water: the PacificOcean makes up 70 million squared miles of that coverage. The force of gravity is strong that you would needto travel at a speed at least seven miles per second to escape it. Approximately two million species of animals,plants and other organisms have been identified and named: it is estimated that approximately 50 millionspecies have yet to be identified.If everyone in the United States recycled their newspapers, the lives of 41,000 tress woul be spared.
