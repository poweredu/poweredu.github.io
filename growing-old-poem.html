Mad Girl's Love Song by Sylvia Plath God topples from the sky, hell's fires fade: Exit seraphim and Satan's men: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. The stars go waltzing out in blue and red, And arbitrary blackness gallops in: I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. I fancied you'd return the way you said, But I grow old and I forget your name. (I think I made you up inside my head.) I dreamed that you bewitched me into bed And sung me moon-struck, kissed me quite insane. (I think I made you up inside my head.) I should have loved a thunderbird instead; At least when spring comes they roar back again. I shut my eyes and all the world drops dead. (I think I made you up inside my head.)"

Forever.Answer the following questions:1. What is the poem all about?2. How farmers are outstanding in their field?3. Why farmers said "Raising food, caring for the land - in their blood”?​</a>

There I'll come when I'm a man With a camel caravan;Light a fire in the gloomOf some dusty dining-room;See the pictures on the walls, Heroes fights and festivals; And in a corner find the toys Of the old Egyptian boys.​</a>

Friendship 
by Vener Santos
Days will pass,
And things will grow old...
Flowers will bloom,
And soon will decay...
But when a friendship starts,
All of the year it will remain fresh.
Friends will grow old,
But friendship will never...
As long as both cares,
It will remain young forever...
Death will separate it on earth,
But it will reborn in heaven...</a>

                                            Direction: In each paragraph below, write the topic sentence in your answer sheet.
1. The best trip my family ever took was to Tagaytay. We drove there in 4 hours. I didn’t think it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We stayed in Tagaytay Highlands. We rode the cable car, and visited a mini zoo where there was a parrot who stole mom’s earring! I liked the climate best, because it was cool unlike the usual warm climate we have in Pampanga. 
2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensils before using them. Clean utensils won’t transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eat with. 
3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don’t realize that every time they hear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, many song lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn’t old-fashioned; it’s as modern as the latest hit song!
4. Growing a garden can be fun, can allow a person to have good exercise, and can provide fresh fruits and vegetables for the gardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.
5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about what happened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening the next day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or just counting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music or gentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mind enough that you will be able to sleep in no time.</a>

MY HEART LEAPS UP

SO WAS IT WHEN MY LIFE BEGAN;
SO IS IT I AM A MAN;
SO BE IT WHEN I SHALL GROW OLD;
OR LET ME DIE!
THE CHILD IS FATHER OF THE MAN;
AND I COULD WISH MY DAYS TO BE
BOUND EACH TO EACH BY NATURAL PIETY
plssss help me answer this </h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>As I read the poem "<strong>My Heart Leaps Up</strong>" by William Wordsworth, I couldn't help but <strong>feel </strong>a <strong>sense of wonder</strong> and <strong>appreciation for the beauty of nature</strong>. The poem begins with the line, "My heart leaps up when I behold a rainbow in the sky," which is a <strong>sentiment that I can completely relate to</strong>. Seeing a rainbow after a rainfall can be a breathtaking sight and evoke a sense of awe and wonder.</p><p></p><p>The second stanza speaks to the idea of how our childhood experiences shape who we become as adults. The line "The child is father of the man" suggests that our <strong>formative years have a significant impact on the person we will become</strong>. It reminds me of how my own childhood experiences have influenced the way I view the world and the person I have become.</p><p></p><strong>The final stanza contains a powerful wish:</strong> "And I could wish my days to be bound each to each by natural piety." This line speaks to the <strong>idea that we should remain connected to nature throughout our lives</strong>. It is a wish to stay in tune with the natural world and find meaning in it. For me, this is a reminder to appreciate the natural world around us and to strive to live a life in harmony with nature.<p></p><p>Overall, "My Heart Leaps Up" is a <strong>beautiful</strong> and<strong> thought-provoking poem</strong> that speaks to the power of nature and the importance of staying connected to it throughout our lives. It is a reminder to appreciate the beauty of the world around us and to stay in tune with the natural rhythms of life. The poem is a call to action, urging us to live a life of natural piety and to remain connected to the natural world throughout our lives.</p><p>The poem "My Heart Leaps Up" by William Wordsworth is a beautiful expression of the profound connection that we as humans have with nature. The opening lines of the poem are particularly powerful, with the speaker expressing how his heart leaps up when he sees a rainbow in the sky. The use of the word "leaps" creates a vivid image of excitement and joy, suggesting that the speaker is deeply moved by the sight of the rainbow.</p><p></p><p>As the poem continues, the speaker reflects on the fact that he has felt this same sense of wonder and awe since the beginning of his life. He connects this feeling to his identity as a man, suggesting that it is an integral part of who he is. The final lines of the poem, in which the speaker expresses his desire for his days to be bound each to each by "natural piety," further emphasize the idea that we are all connected to nature in a profound way.</p><p></p><p>Personally, I found this poem to be a deeply moving expression of the human relationship with nature. It is easy to get caught up in the busyness and stress of modern life, and sometimes we forget to take the time to appreciate the beauty of the world around us. Reading this poem reminded me of the importance of taking a step back and simply enjoying the natural world. It also reminded me of the ways in which we are all connected to nature, and how this connection can bring us a sense of peace and contentment.</p><p></p><p>Overall, I believe that this poem is a testament to the power of nature to move and inspire us. It is a reminder that even in our fast-paced, technology-driven world, we can still find moments of wonder and joy in the natural world around us. The poem speaks to the timeless human desire to connect with something greater than ourselves, and to find meaning and purpose in our lives. I found it to be a beautiful and inspiring work of poetry, and one that I will certainly return to in the future.</p><br />

                            13. Reflection poem about the poem entitled Travel by Robert Louis Stevenson.TRAVELRobert Louis StevensonI should like to rise and goWhere the golden apples grow;-- Where below another skyParrot islands anchored lie,And, watched by cockatoos and goats, Lonely Crusoes building boats;--Where in sunshine reaching outEastern cities, miles about,Are with mosque and minaretAmong sandy gardens set,And the rich goods from near and farHang for sale in the bazaar;--Where the Great Wall round China goes,And on one side the desert blows,And with the voice and bell and drum,Cities on the other hum;--Where are forests hot as fire,Wide as England, tall as a spire,Full of apes and cocoa-nutsAnd the negro hunters' huts;--Where the knotty crocodile Lies and blinks in the Nile, And the red flamingo flies Hunting fish before his eyes;-- Where in jungles near and far, Man-devouring tigers are,Lying close and giving earLest the hunt be drawing near,Or a comer-by be seenSwinging in the palanquin;-- Where among the desert sandsSome deserted city stands,All its children, sweep and prince, Grown to manhood ages since, Not a foot in street or house, Not a stir of child or mouse, And when kindly falls the night, In all the town no spark of light. There I'll come when I'm a man With a camel caravan;Light a fire in the gloomOf some dusty dining-room;See the pictures on the walls, Heroes fights and festivals; And in a corner find the toys Of the old Egyptian boys.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Robert Louis Stevenson's poem "Travel" is a call to explore new places and experience different cultures. The poem expresses a desire to go where "the golden apples grow" and "parrot islands anchored lie".</p><p>It encourages readers to step out of their comfort zones and embark on a journey of self-discovery. </p><p>A reflection poem about this work could focus on the importance of travel in broadening one's horizons, learning about oneself, and gaining new perspectives. It could also explore the emotions that arise when leaving home and venturing into the unknown.</p><p></p><br />

                            14. In the poem "Hanging Fire" the speaker describes themself as 14 years old and still growing up. When do you think someone can consider themselves grown up? What are some of the challenges teenagers experience as they grow up? Which growing pains explored in the poem do you relate to and why?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The age at which someone can consider themselves grown up can vary depending on cultural, social, and personal factors. Generally, it is believed that an individual reaches adulthood when they reach the age of majority, which is 18 years old in many countries. However, reaching a certain age does not automatically make someone a grown-up. Some people may feel more mature and responsible than others at a younger age, while others may still be growing and learning well into their twenties or thirties.</p><p>Teenagers experience many challenges as they grow up, including physical changes, hormonal changes, and social pressures. They may struggle with identity formation, figuring out who they are and what they believe in. They may also experience anxiety, depression, or other mental health issues. Additionally, teenagers may face academic pressure, conflicts with parents or peers, and the challenge of making important life decisions.</p><p>In the poem "Hanging Fire," the speaker describes several growing pains that many teenagers may relate to, including feeling unsure of oneself, worrying about fitting in with peers, and struggling to communicate effectively with parents. The speaker also expresses concerns about sexual identity and pregnancy, which are common issues for teenagers to grapple with as they navigate the complexities of adolescence.</p><p>Overall, the challenges that teenagers face as they grow up are complex and multifaceted, and they require patience, understanding, and support from parents, teachers, and other adults in their lives.</p><p></p><br />

Friendship 
by Vener Santos
Days will pass,
And things will grow old...
Flowers will bloom,
And soon will decay...
But when a friendship starts,
All of the year it will remain fresh.
Friends will grow old,
But friendship will never...
As long as both cares,
It will remain young forever...
Death will separate it on earth,
But it will reborn in heaven...</h2><br />

                            17. Direction: In each paragraph below, write the topic sentence in your answer sheet.
1. The best trip my family ever took was to Tagaytay. We drove there in 4 hours. I didn’t think it would be very interesting, but I was wrong. We stayed in Tagaytay Highlands. We rode the cable car, and visited a mini zoo where there was a parrot who stole mom’s earring! I liked the climate best, because it was cool unlike the usual warm climate we have in Pampanga. 
2. No one likes to eat with a dirty knife, fork, or spoon. It is important to completely wash all utensils before using them. Clean utensils won’t transmit germs and bacteria. They also are more pleasant to eat with. 
3. Many people think poetry is old-fashioned and uninteresting. They don’t realize that every time they hear a song sung, they are hearing poetry in the form of song lyrics. Just like many written poems, many song lyrics use rhythm, rhyme, and literary imagery. It turns out that poetry isn’t old-fashioned; it’s as modern as the latest hit song!
4. Growing a garden can be fun, can allow a person to have good exercise, and can provide fresh fruits and vegetables for the gardener. It is interesting to watch the seeds pop their heads above the soil for the first time. It is sometimes hard to believe that a little seed can become a large vine or plant in just a few weeks. Planting the seeds and pulling weeds are good exercise for anyone. Then, after watching the plant grow and produce, the gardener ends up with delicious tomatoes, beans, or other yummy produce from the garden.
5. Sometimes it is hard to fall asleep. Maybe you are not sleepy, or maybe you are thinking about what happened during the day. You can also lie awake if a big event, like a test or a party, is happening the next day. There are several things you can do to try and fall asleep. You can try counting sheep, or just counting, which will keep your mind busy with a repetitious activity. Sometimes listening to soft music or gentle sounds, like rain, helps. You can even try telling yourself a story, which may distract your mind enough that you will be able to sleep in no time.</h2><br />

                            25. Read the poem entitled my" Heart Leaps Up" by william wordsworth and write a brief personal reaction to present  your personal response to the literary selection. Present what u feel after reading the poem in your reaction paper. MY HEART LEAPS UP My heart leaps up when I behold A rainbow in the sky :So was it when my life began ;So is it now I am a man ;So be it when I shall grow old,Or let me die! The child is father of the Man ;And I could wish my days to be Bound each to each by natural piety.​</h2><br />
                        Answer<p>The poem "Heart Leaps Up" by William Wordsworth is about the pure joy of seeing a rainbow during childhood. For me, the poem compelled me to be appreciative and be grateful for the simple wonders of nature we encounter throughout our lives. The poem reminds me of how Buzz Aldrin praised God for his creation when he and Armstrong first walked on Earth's moon. As William expresses in his poem, we should be able to retain our childlike hearts, being in awe and wonder of God's power. As Jesus said in <strong>Matthew 18:3</strong> says, “unless you turn and become like little children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven."</p><p></p><p><strong>What is Morally Righteous? -</strong> https://brainly.ph/question/6114652</p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><p> </p><br />
