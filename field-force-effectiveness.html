An __________can be made stronger by using more coils of wire. Each turn of the wire adds more force to the electromagnet. The number of dry cells also affects the ______of an electromagnet. More dry cells mean more electrons flowing in the electromagnet and, therefore, stronger _______ is produced. The size of the iron core also matters. The greater the size of the iron core, the ______ magnetism an electromagnet has. An electromagnet is a kind of magnet where the magnetic field is created by an______.

Place a wire that is connected to a power pack in between the poles of a horseshoe magnet.An <strong>electric motor</strong> is an electrical machine that converts electrical energy into mechanical energy. Most electric motors operate through the interaction between the motor's magnetic field and electric current in a wire winding to generate force in the form of torque applied on the motor's shaft.<strong>Direct current </strong>is the one directional flow of electric charge. An electrochemical cell is a prime example of DC power. Direct current may flow through a conductor such as a wire, but can also flow through semiconductors, insulators, or even through a vacuum as in electron or ion beamsA <strong>magnetic field</strong> is a vector field that describes the magnetic influence on moving electric charges, electric currents, and magnetic materials. ... Magnetic fields surround magnetized materials, and are created by electric currents such as those used in electromagnets, and by electric fields varying in time.In <strong>electricity generation,</strong> a generator is a device that converts motive power into electrical power for use in an external circuit. Sources of mechanical energy include steam turbines, gas turbines, water turbines, internal combustion engines, wind turbines and even hand cranks. <strong>coil</strong><strong> </strong><strong>noun</strong><strong>nouna length of something wound or arranged in a spiral or sequence of rings.</strong><strong>nouna length of something wound or arranged in a spiral or sequence of rings."a coil of rope"</strong><strong>nouna length of something wound or arranged in a spiral or sequence of rings."a coil of rope"verb</strong><strong>nouna length of something wound or arranged in a spiral or sequence of rings."a coil of rope"verbarrange or wind (something long and flexible) in a joined sequence of concentric circles or rings.</strong><br />
