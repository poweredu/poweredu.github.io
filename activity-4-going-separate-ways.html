                            3. Activity #4 Going Separate Ways in Grade 10 science module......</h2><br />
                        <p>In science 10 unit 1 module 1 activity 4, the title of the activity is Going Separate ways. <strong>Going Separates Ways</strong> talk about the plates that are<strong> moving away</strong> from each other. When plates are moving away  from each other, the type of boundary created is <strong>Divergent Boundary</strong>. So activity 4 is all about <strong>Divergent boundary</strong>, its mechanism and the geological features formed with type of plate boundary.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Here are the questions presented on this activity.
</strong></p><p><strong>Q28.</strong> What are common in the four pictures?
</p><p><strong>Answer:
</strong></p><p>
All picture shows a fissure or cracks between two land masses.
</p><p><strong>
Q29. </strong>The land masses in each picture were once  connected Millions of years ago. What will be its effect to the earth's crust?  </p><p><strong>
Answer:
</strong></p><p>
If they are connected millions of years ago it means, the land masses are moving away from each other very slowly.
</p><p><strong>Q30.</strong> What will be its effect to earth's crust if this event will continue for millions of years?
</p><p>
<strong>Answer:</strong>
</p><p>
If this event continues for millions of years, the cracks will become wider and the two land masses will be more far away from each other. The creation of new crust between the land masses also widen.
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Divergent Boundary</strong>
</p><p>
Occur between plates that are moving apart and new crust is created by magma pushing up from the mantle.
</p><p>

</p><p>
</p><p><strong>
Here are the list of Geological features present in divergent boundary
</strong></p>Rift valleys
Mid-ocean ridge
Volcanoes
Earthquake
<p><strong>
Rift valleys
</strong></p><p>
Occurs on diverging continental plates.
</p><p><strong>
Mid-ocean ridge
</strong></p><p>
Occurs on diverging oceanic plate. The other name of it is underwater mountain ranges. You can find relatively young rocks in this area. Seafloor spreading also can be observed in this area which provide valid evidence for continental drift theory.
</p><p>
<strong>Volcanoes
</strong></p><p>
Volcanoes are formed as magma pushing the crust but it is not that violent compared to the volcanoes found in convergent boundary.
</p><p><strong>
Earthquake
</strong></p><p>
As the plates are moving away from each other, it produces earthquake but not strong like earthquake produce in convergent boundaries.
</p><p>
</p><p>When a continent started to break apart and move away from each other, the crust may  break into several segments. The breaking leads to the formation of down  faulted valleys called rift valleys. In the middle of the boundary, magma also rises on the surface as the lithosphere melted below. When this magma cools down, it would result to the formation of new plate.
</p><p>
</p><p>The rift valley widen its length and depth as the spreading continues.  Because of this phenomena, the valley develops into a linear sea, the same to the Red Sea today
</p><p>
</p><p><strong>Here are some list of rift valley formed in the world.</strong></p>
Rhine Rift ValleyBaikal Rift ValleyRed Sea
Rio Grande Rift
<p><strong>Divergent boundary</strong> are also known as constructive boundary. Seafloor spreading occur in divergent boundary which created a new crust. today, the distance between Africa and America widen due to the presence of mid-atlantic ridge between them. Mid-atlantic ridge is an indicator of divergent plate boundary, new seafloor are created new this area which widen the distance between the two continents.
