                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>FOOD INDUSTRY</strong></p><p>FOOD LABELLING ISSUES:
Quantitative Research with Consumers  (EVALUATION REPORT SERIES NO. 4)</p><p>This quantitative research with consumers was conducted at the time of transition from  the old to the new Code in order to provide baseline indicators of consumer attitudes  towards labelling, awareness and use of different labelling elements, beliefs about the  clarity and trustworthiness of labels, and which label elements consumers find difficult to  interpret. </p><p><strong>MEDICINE </strong></p><p>Quantitative Research Methods in Medical Education </p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>There has been a dramatic growth of scholarly articles in medical education in recent years. Evaluating medical education research requires specific orientation to issues related to format and content. Our goal is to review the quantitative aspects of research in medical education so that clinicians may understand these articles with respect to framing the study, recognizing methodologic issues, and utilizing instruments for evaluating the quality of medical education research. This review can be used both as a tool when appraising medical education research articles and as a primer for clinicians interested in pursuing scholarship in medical education.</p><p><strong>TOURISM </strong></p><p>Quantitative research in tourism and hospitality: an agenda for best-practice recommendations </p><p>This paper aims to serve as an important guide for more rigorous quantitative research in tourism and hospitality.
</p><p>  This paper relies on comments from several methodological experts in the field, as well as the authors’ main observation of the literature.
</p><p>  This paper identifies ten important areas of concern. In each of these areas, the authors provide recommendations for best practices.</p><p><strong>INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY </strong></p><p>One to One Technology and its Effect on Student Academic  Achievement and Motivation</p><p>Abstract
</p><p>This research was a quantitative study using 4th grade participants from a Title 1 elementary
</p><p>school in Central Illinois. This study set out to determine whether one to one technology (1:1  will be used hereafter) truly impacts and effects the academic achievement of students. This  study’s second goal was to determine whether 1:1 Technology also effects student motivation  to learn. Data was gathered from students participating in this study through the Pearson  enVision Math series with Topic Tests, Discovery Education Assessment results, and attendance  records being used. The results show that 1:1 Technology could be a factor in student academic  achievement and motivation to be at school. These findings are important due to the  technological shift that schools are currently facing. With more technology exposure for  students and more professional development for teachers to hone their newly acquired  teaching methods, 1:1 Technology may be the catalyst needed for school districts to help their  students achieve at higher levels.</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p>NOTE: </p><p>I can't include the link please do search the titles for your citation.</p><p></p><p>P.s </p><p>-this are researched articles </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYFAST</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
