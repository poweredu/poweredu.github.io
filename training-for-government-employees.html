                                            Case 1: Medina Company: The Change of Management 
Medina Company is the leading bus company in the area of
Zamboanga Peninsula. They are serving the routes of Zamboanga
Peninsula since 1995. They started with 10 buses but not grow to 250
buses. It was awarded by the Local Government Unit as the Most
Outstanding Companies in 2018 and recognized as one of the most
potential bus companies to dominate the other areas 10 years from
now.
The founder of the company reached the retirement age and wishes
to retire. He is worried who will succeed the President post on his
company. The owner has three sons Jose, Wally and Paolo.
15
Jose is a Certified Public Accountant and currently employed as the
Chief Accountant of an executive firm. He is well established in the
company, but the downside is the communication skills. He is not
approachable and strict in terms of work but despite such behavior he
continuously grows and be promoted because of his skills which the
management of the company highly values. He is eyed to be the next Vice President of the company he works which happens to be his ambition.
Wally is a business management major and currently operates a
business in Cebu. His business was used to be the number one disco bar
but due to the pandemic he needs to shut it off. He has also another
business which is car trading. The business earns an average income. His
work ethics was great and treats the employees well. The downside of his
work attitude is the cash management. He is not that good in handling
efficiently the cash income of the business.
Paolo is a beauty consultant of his own business. He was able to
expand his business in just a matter of five years and reached 20
branches. Their company wishes to be the number one beauty consultancy
services in the area of Davao. Paolo was unable to finish his degree in
business administration and was distracted to join beauty pageants
instead. His current business was the most successful among the other
five business which he failed. He has a good communication skill and even
won a beauty pageant title.
The three sons are no perfect at all which the owner acknowledges.
The Medina Company is willing to train any person who will be appointed
by the owner to be the next President. It is now a headache who will be the
proper choice.</a>

                            10. Case 1: Medina Company: The Change of Management 
Medina Company is the leading bus company in the area of
Zamboanga Peninsula. They are serving the routes of Zamboanga
Peninsula since 1995. They started with 10 buses but not grow to 250
buses. It was awarded by the Local Government Unit as the Most
Outstanding Companies in 2018 and recognized as one of the most
potential bus companies to dominate the other areas 10 years from
now.
The founder of the company reached the retirement age and wishes
to retire. He is worried who will succeed the President post on his
company. The owner has three sons Jose, Wally and Paolo.
15
Jose is a Certified Public Accountant and currently employed as the
Chief Accountant of an executive firm. He is well established in the
company, but the downside is the communication skills. He is not
approachable and strict in terms of work but despite such behavior he
continuously grows and be promoted because of his skills which the
management of the company highly values. He is eyed to be the next Vice President of the company he works which happens to be his ambition.
Wally is a business management major and currently operates a
business in Cebu. His business was used to be the number one disco bar
but due to the pandemic he needs to shut it off. He has also another
business which is car trading. The business earns an average income. His
work ethics was great and treats the employees well. The downside of his
work attitude is the cash management. He is not that good in handling
efficiently the cash income of the business.
Paolo is a beauty consultant of his own business. He was able to
expand his business in just a matter of five years and reached 20
branches. Their company wishes to be the number one beauty consultancy
services in the area of Davao. Paolo was unable to finish his degree in
business administration and was distracted to join beauty pageants
instead. His current business was the most successful among the other
five business which he failed. He has a good communication skill and even
won a beauty pageant title.
The three sons are no perfect at all which the owner acknowledges.
The Medina Company is willing to train any person who will be appointed
by the owner to be the next President. It is now a headache who will be the
proper choice.</h2><br />

Fina has been in the business for more than 20 years and because of her courage and enterprise, she was able to put up 3 branches in each of the capital towns of 3 adjoining provinces, namely Nueva ecija, Tarlac and Pangasinan . She is planning to operate in nueva vizcaya and isabela in the near future. The business involves using machine to copy documents, books, magazine and other material. Fina employs 6 young ladies per branch. A big dealer in manila supplies her with the latest copying machine, paper and ink. Fina has open credit line with the dealer. Fina personally trains new employees in the firm's main office in Dagupan. After a month of training, the new employees are deployed in various branches. New employees are paid daily wages depending on output . They are also entitled to free board and lodging . The firm's customer consist of teachers,students, government employees and some others. Just a week ago, the dean of a big school in the city propose to her the copying of books to be sold to students. The dean indicate tht she will take care of selling the books to students in her School. For the service, the dean was expecting a 20 percent commission. Fina thinks the proposal is a good one and it will yield good profits. Shes not yet fully convince, however, is the proposal is ethically right .

While the proposal may generate significant profits, it may also require additional investment in equipment, labor, and other resources.

Is this proposal in line with her business goals and values? Will it create sustainable growth and opportunities for her business?
