                                            Have you ever experienced having a fever? You usually touch your forehead or neck to check if you have a fever or not. You use your sense of touch to tell whether an object is hot or cold or one is hotter or colder than the other. When bathing a baby, you dip your fingers in the water, and when you prepare baby's milk, you sprinkle a few drops of milk on your wrist to check if the temperature is just right. When you are about to fry some food, you sprinkle some water to see if the frying pan is already hot. When you feel you are warm, you often say you have a high temperature. When an object is cold, you often say it has a low temperature. Temperature is commonly associated with coldness or hotness of a body. How do we quantify this difference in the hotness or coldness of a body? You might have experienced that your mother checked your temperature by putting a small glass tube or a digital device called a thermometer in your underarm. 1.

What is the role of pressure in the set up?Let us relate this concept to what is happening inside the volcano. Magma inside the volcano has hightemperature. As the magma is continuously heated, it goes up. As it rises, gas bubbles are developed. The gasbubbles are trapped and expanded causing the molten material to swell also, resulting in a gradual increase inpressure within the volcano. When the pressure exceeds the strength of the overlying rock, fracturing occurs. Theresulting breaks lead to a further drop in confining pressure, which in turn causes even more gas bubbles to form​</a>

                            4. As a physical chemist it is one of your duties to know the solubility of compounds found in the laboratory. The solubility of potassium chloride at 60oC is 47 g per 100 g of water.  At 20oC, the solubility drops to 33 g per 100 g of water. Assume that 140 g of potassium chloride was stirred in 200 mL of water.  a.	At 60oC, how many grams of crystals will settle out of the solution? b.	After cooling the solution at 20oC, how many grams  of crystals can be recovered</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The increased vibration (kinetic energy) of the solute molecules causes them to dissolve ... The impurities dissolve as well, but when the solution is cooled, it is often ... Solubility of a gas in water tends to decrease with increasing temperature, and ... temperature: colder water will be able to have more gas dissolved in it.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            10. Have you ever experienced having a fever? You usually touch your forehead or neck to check if you have a fever or not. You use your sense of touch to tell whether an object is hot or cold or one is hotter or colder than the other. When bathing a baby, you dip your fingers in the water, and when you prepare baby's milk, you sprinkle a few drops of milk on your wrist to check if the temperature is just right. When you are about to fry some food, you sprinkle some water to see if the frying pan is already hot. When you feel you are warm, you often say you have a high temperature. When an object is cold, you often say it has a low temperature. Temperature is commonly associated with coldness or hotness of a body. How do we quantify this difference in the hotness or coldness of a body? You might have experienced that your mother checked your temperature by putting a small glass tube or a digital device called a thermometer in your underarm. 1.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Q1. The taste of the resulting mixture will depend on the proportion of sugar and water in the mixture.</p><p>Q2. When sugar and water are mixed, the individual particles of sugar will dissolve in the water forming a homogenous mixture.</p><p>Q3. The total volume of the sugar mixture is 180 ml (80 ml sugar + 100 ml water).</p><p>Q4. The volume of the resulting sugar mixture is equal to the expected total volume of the unmixed sugar and water. The reason for this is because the sugar particles dissolve in the water, so the total volume of the mixture is equal to the total volume of the unmixed sugar and water.</p><p>Q5. After adding the food coloring or dye to the water, the water will take on the color of the dye. The color of the water will be evenly distributed throughout the water.</p><p>Q6.

Slowly unscrew the caps and observedQuestion 4Do you have the same observation as in the soft drinks?Question 5Explain your answer.In the activity, you have seen the effect of temperature on the amount of gas that can be produced in a liquidHow does this affect the pressure inside the bottle? What is the role of pressure in the set up?Let us relate this concept to what is happening inside the volcano. Magma inside the volcano has hightemperature. As the magma is continuously heated, it goes up. As it rises, gas bubbles are developed. The gasbubbles are trapped and expanded causing the molten material to swell also, resulting in a gradual increase inpressure within the volcano. When the pressure exceeds the strength of the overlying rock, fracturing occurs. Theresulting breaks lead to a further drop in confining pressure, which in turn causes even more gas bubbles to form​</h2><br />
