Try to DEDUCE andformulate its Research topic.Massachusetts provides good opportunities for historic population research, sinceregistration of births, deaths, and marriages was made compulsory in 1639 (Spiegelman,1968:3). Deerfield was selected as the community for study after a number of small towns inNorthwestern Massachusetts were considered. The reason Deerfield was chosen is becauseavailable records appeared to be very complete. The community of Deerfield's ownemphasis on its long history, and efforts by such specific groups as the Pocumtuck ValleyMemorial Asaociation, (founded in 1870), and the Heritage Foundation, provide for a goodlibrary with many well preserved records. Although several references concerning Deerfieldand Massachusetts are consulted, the major sources for the information presented beloware Baldwin's Vital Records of Deerfield, Massachusetts to the Year 1850 (1920); andGeorge Sheldon's History of Deerfield (1896). The major emphasis on the complete recordsgiven in Baldwin 2 (1920) with supplementary information being added from Sheldon'spublished genealogies (pp. 4-407, Vol. II). Sheldon's work is considered by many colonialhistorians to be a very well written and thorough local history. The vital statistics compiled byBaldwin appear to be very complete considering the time period covered and are based ongrave inscriptions as well as town and parish records. These statistics include 4943 births,1485 marriages, and 2204 deaths. In an effort to test the accuracy of the records, the localcemeteries around Deerfield were sample surveyed, and virtually 100 percent of thecemetery markers checked are found in Baldwin.Independent Assessment 1 /Direction: Identify the DATA used in the previous paragraph that was used to describe thebackground of the research.

Deerfield was selected as the community for study after a number of small towns inNorthwestern Massachusetts were considered. The reason Deerfield was chosen is becauseavailable records appeared to be very complete. The community of Deerfield's ownemphasis on its long history, and efforts by such specific groups as the Pocumtuck ValleyMemorial Asaociation, (founded in 1870), and the Heritage Foundation, provide for a goodlibrary with many well preserved records. Although several references concerning Deerfieldand Massachusetts are consulted, the major sources for the information presented beloware Baldwin's Vital Records of Deerfield, Massachusetts to the Year 1850 (1920); andGeorge Sheldon's History of Deerfield (1896). The major emphasis on the complete recordsgiven in Baldwin 2 (1920) with supplementary information being added from Sheldon'spublished genealogies (pp. 4-407, Vol. II). Sheldon's work is considered by many colonialhistorians to be a very well written and thorough local history. The vital statistics compiled byBaldwin appear to be very complete considering the time period covered and are based ongrave inscriptions as well as town and parish records. These statistics include 4943 births,1485 marriages, and 2204 deaths. In an effort to test the accuracy of the records, the localcemeteries around Deerfield were sample surveyed, and virtually 100 percent of thecemetery markers checked are found in Baldwin.Independent Assessment 1 /Direction: Identify the DATA used in the previous paragraph that was used to describe thebackground of the research.
