                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Festivals in the Philippines can be religious, cultural, or both. Several of these are held to honor the local Roman Catholic patron saint, to commemorate local history and culture, to promote the community's products, or to celebrate a bountiful harvest. They can be marked by Holy Masses, processions, parades, theatrical play and reenactments, religious or cultural rituals, trade fairs, exhibits, concerts, pageants and various games and contests. However, festivals in the country are not limited to Christian origins. Many festivals also focus on Islamic or indigenous concepts. There are more than 42,000 known major and minor festivals in the Philippines, the majority of which are in the barangay (village) level. Due to the thousands of town, city, provincial, national, and village fiestas in the country, the Philippines has traditionally been known as the Capital of the World's Festivities.[citation needed]</p><p></p><p>Some festivals, such as Holy Week and Christmas, are declared as public holidays, and thus, are observed and celebrated nationwide.</p><p></p><p>Nature and origin of festival dances:</p><p>SINULOG FESTIVAL OF CEBU.</p><p>DINAGYANG FESTIVAL OF ILOILO.</p><p>ATI-ATIHAN FESTIVAL OF KALIBO, AKLAN.</p><p>BUYUGAN FESTIVAL OF LEYTE.</p><p>BANGUS FESTIVAL OF DAGUPAN.</p><p>T'NALAK FESTIVAL OF SOUTH COTABATO.</p><p>MASSKARA FESTIVAL OF BACOLOD CITY.</p><br />
