</p>Summary of the Soul of the Great Bell
<p>
</p><p>Nearly 500 years ago, the Celestial August and Yung-Lo commanded his greatest bellsmiths and mouders to create a bell that will create a sound that reaches 100 Li.  </p><p>
</p><p>It was spearheaded by Kouan-Yu. They tried to cast a bell twice but gold, silver, brass, iron wouldn’t meld together.
</p><p>
</p><p>At first, when the Son of Heaven heard about it, he got angry but he spake nothing. When the second time the Celestial August learned about the situation, he got angrier and sent Kouan-Yu a letter warning him that if they wouldn’t successfully cast the bell, he would be condemned to death.
</p><p>
</p><p>Ko-Ngai is the daughter of Kouan-Yu. She is exquisite but her heart is much more beautiful than her face.  </p><p>
</p><p>Ko-Ngai found the letter, read it, and kept mum about it. She sold her jewelries and gold to pay an astrologer she needs to consult for an advice. The astrologer informed her that gold and brass will never meet in wedlock, silver and iron never will embrace until the flesh of a maiden is melted in the crucible and the blood of a virgin is mixed in the metal fusion.  </p><p>
</p><p>Thus, in the third attempt, Ko-Ngai leapt in the crucible. His father couldn’t do anything, he was sorrowful but they need to follow the order of the Celestial August and Yung-Lo.
</p><p>
</p><p>They casted the bell with success. As they rang the bell, it created a sound that is deeper, mellower and mightier than any other bell.  </p><p>

                        <br />The Soul of the Great Bell by Lafcadio Hearn (1850-1904)<br />          The water-clock marks the hour in the Tachung sz’, in the Tower of the Great Bell: now the mallet is lifted to smite the lips of the metal monster—the vast lips inscribed with Buddhist texts from the sacred Fa-hwa-King, from the chapters of the holy Ling-yen-King! Hear the great bell responding!—how mighty her voice, though tongueless! KO-NGAI!<br />          All the little dragons on the high-tilted eaves of the green roofs shiver to the tips of their gilded tails under that deep wave of sound; all the porcelain gargoyles tremble on their carven perches; all the hundred little bells of the pagodas quiver with desire to speak. KO-NGAI—all the green-and-gold tiles of the temple are vibrating; the wooden goldfish above them are writhing against the sky; the uplifted finger of Fo shakes high over the heads of the worshippers through the blue fog of incense! KO-NGAI!—What a thunder tone was that!<br /><br />          Nearly five hundred years ago the Celestially August, the Son of Heaven, Yong-Lo, of the “Illustrious” or Ming dynasty, commanded the worthy official Kouan-Yu that he should have a bell made of such size that the sound thereof might be heard for one hundred li. And he further ordained that the voice of the bell should be strengthened with brass, and deepened with gold, and sweetened with silver; and that the face and the great lips of it should be graven with blessed sayings from the sacred books, and that it should be suspended in the centre of the imperial capital to sound through all the many-coloured ways of the City of Pe-King.<br /><br />          Now, Kouan-Yu had a daughter of dazzling loveliness whose name—Ko-Ngai—was ever in the mouths of poets, and whose heart was even more beautiful than her face. Ko-Ngai loved her father with such love that she had refused a hundred worthy suitors rather than make his home desolate by her absence; and when she had seen the awful yellow missive, sealed with the Dragon-Seal, she fainted away with fear for her father’s sake. And when her senses and her strength returned to her, she could not rest or sleep for thinking of her parent’s danger, until she had secretly sold some of her jewels, and with the money so obtained had hastened to an astrologer, and paid him a great price to advise her by what means her father might be saved from the peril impending over him. So the astrologer made observations of the heavens, and marked the aspect of the Silver Stream (which we call the Milky Way), and examined the signs of the Zodiac—the Hwang-tao, or Yellow Road—and consulted the table of the Five Hin, or Principles of the Universe, and the mystical books of the alchemists. And after a long silence, he made answer to her, saying: “Gold and brass will never meet in wedlock, silver and iron never will embrace, until the flesh of a maiden be melted in the crucible; until the blood of a virgin be mixed with the metals in their fusion.” So Ko-Ngai returned home sorrowful at heart; but she kept secret all that she had heard, and told no one what she had done.<br /><br />          But in spite of all these things, the command of the Celestial and August had to be obeyed, and the work of the moulders to be finished, hopeless as the result might be. Yet the glow of the metal seemed purer and whiter than before; and there was no sign of the beautiful body that had been entombed therein. So the ponderous casting was made; and lo! when the metal had become cool, it was found that the bell was beautiful to look upon and perfect in form, and wonderful in colour above all other bells. Nor was there any trace found of the body of Ko-Ngai; for it had been totally absorbed by the precious alloy, and blended with the well-blended brass and gold, with the intermingling of the silver and the iron. And when they sounded the bell, its tones were found to be deeper and mellower and mightier than the tones of any other bell, reaching even beyond the distance of one hundred li, like a pealing of summer thunder; and yet also like some vast voice uttering a name, a woman’s name, the name of Ko-Ngai.<br />          And still, between each mighty stroke there is a long low moaning heard; and ever the moaning ends with a sound of sobbing and of complaining, as though a weeping woman should murmur, “Hiai!” And still, when the people hear that great golden moan they keep silence, but when the sharp, sweet shuddering comes in the air, and the sobbing of “Hiai!” then, indeed, do all the Chinese mothers in all the many-coloured ways of Pe-King whisper to their little ones: “Listen! that is Ko-Ngai crying for her shoe! That is Ko-Ngai calling for her shoe!”<br />

                        Five hundred years ago, the Celestial August and Yung- Lo commanded the worthy official Kouan- Yu to make a bell that the sound there of might be heard for one hundred Li. He therefore called the master moulders and renowned bellsmiths and all men of great repute and cunning in foundry work to began the labor. But when the metal had been cast, it was discovered that the result was void of worth; for the metals had rebelled one against the other therefore the moulds had to be once more prepared, and the fires rekindled, and the metal remelted, and all the work tediously and toilsomely repeated. The Son of Heaven heard and was angry, but spake nothing. A second time the bell was cast, and the result was even worse. The Celestial August was angrier than before and send Kouan- Yu letter telling him that another failure will cost his life. Ko- ngai, the daughter of Kouan- Yu learned about this and feared the life of his father so she consulted an astrologer and gave her an answer "Gold and brass will never meet in wedlock, silver and iron never will embrace, until the flesh of a maiden be melted in the crucible; until the blood of a virgin be mixed with the metals in their fusion." So Ko-Ngai returned home sorrowful at heart; but she kept secret all that she had heard, and told no one what she had done. At last came the awful day when the third and last effort to cast the great bell was to be made; and Ko-Ngai, together with her waiting-woman, accompanied her father to the foundry, and they took their places upon a platform overlooking the toiling of the moulders and the lava of liquefied metal. Then Ko- Ngai leaped into the white flood of metal and the lava of the furnace roared to receive her. All was shocked including his father and her waiting-woman holding her shoe. But in spite of all these things, the command of the Celestial and August had to be obeyed. It was found that the bell was beautiful to look upon and perfect in form, and wonderful in colour above all other bells. And when they sounded the bell, its tones were found to be deeper and mellower and mightier than the tones of any other bell, reaching even beyond the distance of one hundred li, like a pealing of summer thunder; and yet also like some vast voice uttering a name of Ko-Ngai. And still, between each mighty stroke there is a long low moaning heard and when the people hear that great golden moan they keep silence, but when the sharp and the sobbing of "Hiai!" then, indeed, do all the Chinese mothers whisper to their little ones: "Listen! that is Ko-Ngai crying for her shoe! That is Ko-Ngai calling for her shoe!"<br /><br />

Yu, a worthy official, to make a bell that could sound as far as one hundred li. The
bell should be made of brass, gold, silver, and iron. When Kouan-Yu and his team  of master-molders and bell smiths first attempted to make the bell, the metals did  not go well together. They tried to make the bell again but the result was worse  than the first time. This made Yong Lo angry and he sent Kouan-Yu a message that  said if Kouan-Yu failed to make the bell on his third attempt, Yong Lo would have
him beheaded. Ko-Ngai, the daughter of Kouan-Yu, heard about the message and  became worried for her fatherʼs sake. She secretly paid an astrologer to see how  the bell could be made properly. The astrologer said that the blood of a virgin is  needed to make the metals in the bell fuse. On the day of the third attempt, Ko-
Ngai sacrificed herself and jumped into the melted metal leaving only her shoe.  After that, the bell became beautiful and perfect. The people of Pe-King say that  when the bell is rung, they hear a woman crying for her shoe.

                        <p>Lafcadio Hearn may be the most interesting individual I write about this month, and that’s including fictional characters.  Born on the Greek island Lefkada to an Irish Sergeant Major and a Greek noblewoman, he was raised in Dublin.  At the age of 19 he moved to Cincinnati where he became a journalist.  He moved to New Orleans in his late 20s, where he spent ten years reporting on local culture, particularly Creole culture and voodoo religion.  In 1890 he moved to Japan, where he apparently found his life’s calling.  Interest in Japanese culture from an appropriative perspective was growing in the Occident and Hearn’s writings on this culture filled a vacuum.  He became something of an ‘insider’ to Japanese culture, teaching in Japan, taking on the name Koizumi Yakumo after marrying Koizumi Setsu and becoming nationalized, and this perspective allowed him to write about Japanese culture with a perspective uniquely multinational.  Interestingly, to this day he is considered by many to be something of a figure of Japanese nationalism; for a culture normally regarded as very xenophobic, turn-of-the-century Japan seems to have adopted him wholesale.</p><p>This isn’t to underplay his skills as a writer; his particular writings became so renowned through his skill at recording and conveying Japanese culture, treating it with respect without losing the sense of ‘Oriental’ otherness that so entertained Western culture.  In my reading I have more than once encountered offhand references to Hearn in other books, making me think that he was something of a household name in the first half of the century, a sort of cultural emissary of all things Japanese.  But not just Japanese—his most well-known efforts are his recordings of ghost stories.  These ghost story recordings have become such a canonical part of the representation of Japanese folk culture that when Masaki Kobayashi directed his visually-stunning ghost story anthology in 1965, he named it Kwaidan after Hearn’s collection of ghost stories, rather than Kaidan, the more phonetic rendering of the word for ghost story.  It’s fortunate that Japanese culture so wholesale adopted him; this avoids the embarrassment of an extranational Brothers Grimm for Japan.</p><br /><br />
