But I think we shouldn't fear it. Instead, we keep its inevitability and unpredictability in mind. And use it to remind us why we should be grateful for every new morning. Why we should love with all the love we can give. Why we should be brave in the pursuit of all that we dream of. Why we should cherish the people we hold dear. Death is uncertain, and it is this uncertainty that reminds us to<strong> truly live today </strong>:))</p><p></p><br />

                            12. Do you agree with Samuel Johnson when he said: “there’s nothing like your impending death tofocus the mind.”​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It isn’t usual that we hear an inner voice and if we tell people, they might think we are weird.  I have heard a number of people say they have heard Jesus talk and direct them. I don’t question that because I believe them and think it is scripturally possible.
</p><p>
</p><p>I take Forges Magazine and went to their website.  I read an article by Eric Jackson “Tell the Top Ten Lessons Steve Jobs Taught Us”.  Included in the article were parts of a speech Steve Jobs gave in 2005 at Stanford University’s commencement.   Eric Jackson wrote “Eight years ago, he was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told he only had a few weeks to live.  As Samuel Johnson said, there’s nothing like your impending death to focus the mind.”
</p><p>
</p><p>Following is from Steve Jobs speech at Stanford: “No one wants to die. Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there. And yet death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it. And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life. It is Life’s change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new. Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away. Sorry to be so dramatic, but it is quite true.”
</p><p>
</p><p>“Your time is limited, so don’t waste it living someone else’s life. Don’t be trapped by dogma — which is living with the results of other people’s thinking. Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice. And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary.”
</p><p>
</p><p>From a leadership and management background I was impressed at the ten points Steve Jobs taught.  As a Christian the sentence that said:  “Don’t let the noise of others’ opinions drown out your own inner voice.”  I don’t know whether it was used as a metaphor or an actual voice. I assume it was a metaphor.  If people talk about a voice and not their conscience then whose voice are they hearing?  To many Christians, an inner voice can be audible and to a non-Christian the inner voice could be your conscience or an audible voice but from an evil spirit.
</p><p>
</p><p>I previously wrote two blogs: Are some people evil? The other was: “Amy Winehouse was one of many rock stars to die at age 27”.  The question came from a story that was read to us when I was in grade school.  It was “The Devil and Daniel Webster”.  The story concerned a farmer who sold his soul to the devil for a better more prosperous life.  I have never stopped wondering; when someone hears an inner voice, whose is it?  No way am I implying that either of the above heard actual voices but it leaves a troubling question.  Anyone hearing an inner voice must be careful from whom and where it comes from.
</p><p>
</p><p>What Steve Jobs did for the world was the work of a genius.  No one can question his ingenuity.  I have always wondered what made Einstein, Ford, Edison, Lincoln and so many others so different from the other 99.9% of the population.  There were many spiritual Christian giants that affected the world. We think they were hearing an inner voice that came from the Holy Spirit.  How many people actually hear an audible inner voice?  We know some do!
</p><p>
</p><p>What we do know about these individuals is that they had a gift, talent, ambition and determination.  They had a vision and a passion that consumed them almost 24/7.  How many others may have had similar gifts, talents but lacked ambition, a vision or the passion?  One thing genius’ all had was confidence and all were tenacious to the point of never giving up on what they believed.
</p><p>
</p><p>Steve said: “Even people who want to go to heaven don’t want to die to get there.”  I hope heaven was his goal and that inner voice he was talking about was the Holy Spirit, if he was referring to an actual voice and not meaning his conscience. It is not hard to believe that God controls the development of all technology and Steve was chosen to be that person.  This is not an assumption.
</p><p>
</p><p>Some day we may learn the answer when God tells me what potential I had and wasted it.  You may have the potential of some of these famous individuals.  Seek your vision and develop a passion.  Be tenacious and never give up on your dream, regardless what others may say.  When you pray, ask for God to give you a purpose</p><p></p><br />

How long will it last? Will there be pain? What will I leave behind? How do I say goodbye? Next there is the prospect of other people dying, particularly the death of loved-ones and the painful absence their loss leaves behind. How would I cope with the death of a close friend, a partner, a child? But thinking about my dying and other people’s deaths are different. Dying is an event in life, admittedly an important event, but still one that happens within the course of life. Similarly, coming to terms with the loss of a loved-one is an important process, but it belongs to a different domain than my death.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p>sana makatulong pa Brainliest po salamat po</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>No one can tell the actual definition of the meaning of life. For some, it is all about happiness, building a family, and leading life as it is. For some, it is about accumulating wealth, whereas, for some, it is all about love. But for me, life is something you should treasure, you should love, and appreciate. Not everyone has been given the chance to live. So while were living a healthy, clean, and healthy life, we should not take it for granted. This is the belief that you are alive in order to do something. Think of purpose as your personal mission statement, such as “the purpose of my life is to share the secrets to happiness” or “I am here to spread love abundantly.” Significance: life's inherent value. This is the sense that your life matters.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope this helps!</p><br />

                            23. What does it mean that the human person is naturally oriented toward society?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Social nature of human beings
</p><p>God did not create man as a “solitary being,” but wanted him to be a “social being”
</p><p>(cf. Gen 1:27; 2:18-20, 23). Life in society is not something “added-on” for the human
</p><p>person; it stems from an important dimension intrinsic to human nature. Human beings
</p><p>can grow and attain their calling in life only in union with others.1
</p><p>The social nature of the human person is even more evident in the light of faith, since
</p><p>there is a certain likeness between the intimate life of the Holy Trinity and the
</p><p>communion that should be established among mankind; all men and women have been
</p><p>redeemed by Christ and are called to share in the same end.2
</p><p> Revelation teaches us that
</p><p>human relationships should be marked by a deep gratuitousness, since in our neighbor we
</p><p>see, more than an equal, the living image of God, and we have to be ready to give
</p><p>ourselves fully, even to the ultimate extreme, for each one.3
</p><p> 
</p><p>Therefore each person “is called to exist ‘for’ others, to become a gift.”4
</p><p> Existing
</p><p>“for” others entails much more than just “co-existing” with them: it means serving them
</p><p>and loving them. Human freedom “can wither in an ivory-tower isolation brought on by
</p><p>an over indulgence in the good things of life.”5
</p><p>A personal and collective effort is needed to develop social relationships correctly:
</p><p>“The social nature of human beings does not automatically lead to communion among
</p><p>persons, to the gift of self. Because of pride and selfishness, man discovers in himself the
</p><p>seeds of asocial behavior, impulses leading him to close himself within his own
</p><p>individuality and to dominate his neighbor.</p><br />

                        <p>Answer:</p><p></p><p>Explanation:</p><p>﻿As a person, I reflect on the meaning of life and find it to be a complex and multi-faceted concept. To me, being free means having the ability to make choices and live life on my own terms. As a social being, I am intersubjective, constantly interacting and connecting with others. Immersion in society gives me a sense of belonging and purpose, but it also presents challenges and limitations. My experiences and relationships shape my understanding of the world and my place in it. The end of life is a thought that often brings about contemplation and introspection. I find that considering my own mortality and what I hope to accomplish in my lifetime helps me to live with purpose and intention. Ultimately, the meaning of life is a subjective and personal experience, shaped by my unique experiences, relationships, and worldview.</p><br />

We are here because we have a purpose or mission to accomplish and when we already finished the task that's when our life will end.  Morally speaking,  When we reach the point of ending it is the time when we realized that our life span was not just for enjoyment, sadness, nor permanent a thing.  It was everything and more than I just expected like how they used to say "live when u have a chance " and live your life to the fullest.  Thank you! ❤</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"Music teacher" redirects here. For the 2019 Indian film, see Music Teacher (film).</p><p></p><p>A German kindergarten teacher instructs her pupils in singing.</p><p>Music education is a field of practice, in which educators are trained for careers as elementary or secondary music teachers, school or music conservatory ensemble directors. As well, music education is a research area in which scholars do original research on ways of teaching and learning music. Music education scholars publish their findings in peer-reviewed journals, and teach undergraduate and graduate education students at university education or music schools, who are training to become music teachers.</p><p></p><p>Music education touches on all learning domains, including the psychomotor domain (the development of skills), the cognitive domain (the acquisition of knowledge), and, in particular and the affective domain (the learner's willingness to receive, internalize, and share what is learned), including music appreciation and sensitivity. Many music education curriculums incorporate the usage of mathematical skills as well fluid usage and understanding of a secondary language or culture. The consistency of practicing these skills has been shown to benefit students in a multitude of other academic areas as well as improving performance on standardized tests such as the ACT and SAT. Music training from preschool through post-secondary education is common because involvement with music is considered a fundamental component of human culture and behavior. Cultures from around the world have different approaches to music education, largely due to the varying histories and politics. Studies show that teaching music from other cultures can help students perceive unfamiliar sounds more comfortably, and they also show that musical preference is related to the language spoken by the listener and the other sounds they are exposed to within their own culture.</p><p></p><p>During the 20th century, many distinctive approaches were developed or further refined for the teaching of music, some of which have had widespread impact. The Dalcroze method (eurhythmics) was developed in the early 20th century by Swiss musician and educator Émile Jaques-Dalcroze. The Kodály Method emphasizes the benefits of physical instruction and response to music. The Orff Schulwerk approach to music education leads students to develop their music abilities in a way that parallels the development of western music.</p><p></p><p>The Suzuki method creates the same environment for learning music that a person has for learning their native language. Gordon Music Learning Theory provides the music teacher with a method for teaching musicianship through audiation, Gordon's term for hearing music in the mind with understanding. Conversational Solfège immerses students in the musical literature of their own culture, in this case American. The Carabo-Cone Method involves using props, costumes, and toys for children to learn basic musical concepts of staff, note duration, and the piano keyboard. The concrete environment of the specially planned classroom allows the child to learn the fundamentals of music by exploring through touch.[1] The MMCP (Manhattanville Music Curriculum Project) aims to shape attitudes, helping students see music as personal, current, and evolving. Popular music pedagogy is the systematic teaching and learning of rock music and other forms of popular music both inside and outside formal classroom settings. Some have suggested that certain musical activities can help to improve breath, body and voice control of a child.[2]</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
