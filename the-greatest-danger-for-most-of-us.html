                                            Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked. 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do?2.

Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

28. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders) *

29. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals. *

                                            Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions: 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do? 2.

25. Loving the sea I love seeing the blue sea. I love hearing its wave brushing the shore. I like touching the roughness of the sand under my feet. It makes me want to get soak in the salty water even more. I love how it washes away the uncertainties I kept in me. Oh how I love the sea.

26. The Philippines experiences an average of 20 typhoons a year. Being surrounded by bodies of water makes us prone to experience some weather disturbances. The biggest contributor of the weather disturbances in our country is the Pacific Ocean which lies on the eastern side of our country. The vast and warm waters of the ocean can generate many weather disturbances. *

27. When the cold air sinks, it results to a high-pressure area. Since most of the air is pressing down, the air on the surface becomes dry. Formation of a high pressure area indicates fair weather; fewer clouds are found on the sky. As the air continuously rises, it will eventually cool, condense and form clouds. The formation of a low-pressure area indicates the possibility of rain. There is a higher chance of rain when more clouds are formed. An LPA can result to weather disturbances. Rains and strong winds are brought about by low pressure system *

28. Weather disturbances are devastating. They can cause damage to our life and properties. Heavy winds can destroy power and communication lines. Roads and bridges are also damaged due to heavy rainfall and flooding. Weather disturbances can also destroy our means of livelihood. Heavy rain and strong winds can uproot trees and destroy crops that provide us with food. Therefore, there is always food shortage when there is a typhoon. (Source: Science Beyond Borders) *

29. Most animal extinctions are brought about by people. As population increased, people needed more food, more shelters, and more comforts. Forest lands had to give way to agriculture. More trees had to be cut down for housing and furniture. As their natural habitat diminished, so did the population of the tamaraws, eagles and other animals. *

                            7. Reynold's World Reynold's story is not new. It's a story that is echoed in most developing countries around the world. The recent UNICEF report The State of the World's Children 2012. Children in an Urban World reveal that globally, urbanization leaves hundreds of millions of children in cities and towns excluded from vital services. Already the Philippines is an urban society with half the population or 45 million people living in cities. Of Metro Manila's 11 million people, 1.7 million children live in informal settlements. "Children who live in the poorest urban communities in the Philippines experience multiple deprivations. They lack decent housing, are exposed to dangers from disasters, have limited access to clean water and are more prone to neglect, abuse and exploitation. Each excluded child represents a missed opportunity at achieving a stable and productive society, "Dr. Abdul Alim, UNICEF Deputy Representative, says. Cities offer many children the advantages of urban schools, clinics and playgrounds. Yet the same cities the world over are also the settings for some of the greatest disparities in children's health, education and opportunities. Infrastructure and services are not keeping up with urban growth in many regions and children's basic needs are not being met. Families living in poverty often pay more for substandard services. Water, for instance, can cost 50 times more in poor neighborhoods where residents have to buy it from private vendors than it costs in wealthier neighborhoods where households are connected directly to water mains. The deprivations endured by children in poor urban communities are often obscured by broad statistical averages that lump together all city dwellers - rich and poor alike. When averages such as these are used in making urban policy and allocating resources, the needs of the poorest can be overlooked.Questions: 1. If you were in the same situation, what would you do? 2.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>NOTE: answers for number 1 and 2 are connected </p><p>I will have a serious talk with the government officials and let them realized how big and crucial the matter is. Since the report really have statistical figures, this means that it is a valid report that needs immediate action. The life of the children are at stake. In our country we can see the big gap between the rich and the poor children. We can see a lot of children in the street and sometime even asking for money in jeepneys. </p><p>It is better to start with a project that will answer the problem of poverty. Most of the families that belong to informal settlers came to the city to find for a better life opportunity. If we can provide them with jobs, a proper shelter and a clean water, maybe their lives will change. </p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />
