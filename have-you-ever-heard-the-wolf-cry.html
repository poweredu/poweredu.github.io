(10 points) The Boy Who Cried Wolf Once, there was a boy who became bored when he watched over the village sheep grazing on the hillside. To entertain himself, he sang out, "Wolf! Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" When the villagers heard the cry, they came running up the hill to drive the wolf away. But, when they arrived, they saw no wolf. The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces. "Don't scream wolf, boy," warned the villagers, "when there is no wolf!" They angrily went back down the hill. Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, "Wolf Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away. As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly. "Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don't cry 'wolf' when there is no wolf!" But the boy grinned at their words while they walked grumbling down the hill once more. Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, "Wolf Wolf" But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn't come to help. At sunset, the villagers went looking for the boy who hadn't returned with their sheep. When they went up the hill, they found him weeping "There really was a wolf here! The flock is gone! I cried out, 'Wolf' but you didn't come," he wailed.​</a>

                                            a The Boy Who Cried Wolf A Shepherd Boy tended his master's sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His Master had told him to call for help when a Wolf attack the flock, and the villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf?" As he expected, the villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there, they found the boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" Again, the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did come out from the underbrush and fall upon the sheep. In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf!" But though the villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," they said. The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest.Title:Characters:Setting:Plot:Beginning:Middle:Ending:​ </a>

Spare me and I will tell you your future!"The wolf agreed, and the fortunteller held the wolfs ear as she concentrated.After a few minutes of deep thought, the fortuneteller told the wolf, "You will become a shepard"The wolf instantly sat down and started crying, much to the surprise of the fortuneteller."Why are you crying asked the fortuneteller.*I'm afraid you might be lying, replied the wolf.​</a>

The boy was amused when seeing their angry faces. "Don't scream wolf, boy," warned the villagers, "when there is no wolf!" They angrily went back down the hill. Later, the shepherd boy cried out once again, "Wolf Wolf! The wolf is chasing the sheep!" To his amusement, he looked on as the villagers came running up the hill to scare the wolf away. As they saw there was no wolf, they said strictly. "Save your frightened cry for when there really is a wolf! Don't cry 'wolf' when there is no wolf!"

Later, the boy saw a real wolf sneaking around his flock Alarmed, he jumped on his feet and cried out as loud as he could, "Wolf Wolf" But the villagers thought he was fooling them again, and so they didn't come to help.

                            18. a The Boy Who Cried Wolf A Shepherd Boy tended his master's sheep near a dark forest not far from the village. Soon he found life in the pasture very dull. All he could do to amuse himself was to talk to his dog or play on his shepherd's pipe. One day as he sat watching the Sheep and the quiet forest, and thinking what he would do should he see a Wolf, he thought of a plan to amuse himself. His Master had told him to call for help when a Wolf attack the flock, and the villagers would drive it away. So now, though he had not seen anything that even looked like a wolf, he ran toward the village shouting at the top of his voice, "Wolf! Wolf?" As he expected, the villagers who heard the cry dropped their work and ran in great excitement to the pasture. But when they got there, they found the boy doubled up with laughter at the trick he had played on them. A few days later the Shepherd Boy again shouted, "Wolf! Wolf!" Again, the Villagers ran to help him, only to be laughed at again. Then one evening as the sun was setting behind the forest and the shadows were creeping out over the pasture, a Wolf really did come out from the underbrush and fall upon the sheep. In terror the Boy ran toward the village shouting "Wolf! Wolf!" But though the villagers heard the cry, they did not run to help him as they had before. "He cannot fool us again," they said. The Wolf killed a great many of the Boy's sheep and then slipped away into the forest.Title:Characters:Setting:Plot:Beginning:Middle:Ending:​ </h2><br />
