                                            "The art of communication is the language of leadership." (James Humes) It is a mistake to believe that communication is a simple process. Although people communicate with one another every day, the real question is whether the ideas one has expressed are truly understood by another. Communication breakdowns happen in every part of the globe, and these have led to a plethora of problems. Effective communication can breach peace, spark revolutions, and affect change in government. However, to communicate properly, one cannot simply strive to express oneself and leave understanding to fate; one must also learn how to organize one's thoughts, control one's emotions, use one's words to articulate concepts and arguments, and express oneself in the best way possible. The art of one's communication reflects the art of one's thinking. According to James Berlin (1982), one of the major proponents of The New Rhetoric, "In teaching writing, we are not simply offering training in a useful technical skill that is meant as a simple complement to the more important studies of other areas. We are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it" (776). This is also true when it comes to all the language skills essential in communication, whether this is in writing, reading. listening, or speaking. They are tools that help us analyze, critique, and negotiate with the world. To construct ideas and bring people to believe in one's vision, it is important to be able to communicate in an effective, articulate manner. On a personal level, honing one's communication skills can also bring about success to one's personal and professional life. To lead nations or corporations, communication skills are essential. To work smoothly as a team, communication is indispensable. And to create a vision that people will believe in, one needs to learn how to communicate purposefully in today's society. Questions: 1. What problems can happen when there are communication breakdowns? 2. What does Berlin mean when he says "(In teaching writing), we are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it"? 3. Is this only true for writing? Explain.​</a>

"Reading Comprehension Skills and Performance in Science Among High School Students in the Philippines" by Ombra A. Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</a>

                            8. "The art of communication is the language of leadership." (James Humes) It is a mistake to believe that communication is a simple process. Although people communicate with one another every day, the real question is whether the ideas one has expressed are truly understood by another. Communication breakdowns happen in every part of the globe, and these have led to a plethora of problems. Effective communication can breach peace, spark revolutions, and affect change in government. However, to communicate properly, one cannot simply strive to express oneself and leave understanding to fate; one must also learn how to organize one's thoughts, control one's emotions, use one's words to articulate concepts and arguments, and express oneself in the best way possible. The art of one's communication reflects the art of one's thinking. According to James Berlin (1982), one of the major proponents of The New Rhetoric, "In teaching writing, we are not simply offering training in a useful technical skill that is meant as a simple complement to the more important studies of other areas. We are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it" (776). This is also true when it comes to all the language skills essential in communication, whether this is in writing, reading. listening, or speaking. They are tools that help us analyze, critique, and negotiate with the world. To construct ideas and bring people to believe in one's vision, it is important to be able to communicate in an effective, articulate manner. On a personal level, honing one's communication skills can also bring about success to one's personal and professional life. To lead nations or corporations, communication skills are essential. To work smoothly as a team, communication is indispensable. And to create a vision that people will believe in, one needs to learn how to communicate purposefully in today's society. Questions: 1. What problems can happen when there are communication breakdowns? 2. What does Berlin mean when he says "(In teaching writing), we are teaching a way of experiencing the world, a way of ordering and making sense of it"? 3. Is this only true for writing? Explain.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>it's beautiful answer like and give me star I give u answer </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>breakdowns easy 5 star like</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Communication breakdowns can lead to a range of problems, such as misunderstandings, conflicts, missed opportunities, reduced productivity, and even the breakdown of relationships or the failure of organizations.</p><p>2. Berlin means that teaching writing is not just about teaching technical skills, but also about teaching a way of perceiving, organizing, and making sense of the world. Through writing, one can clarify and refine one's thoughts, develop critical thinking skills, and articulate complex ideas in a coherent and persuasive manner. Writing is thus a tool for understanding and engaging with the world, and for communicating one's ideas and perspectives to others.</p><p>3. No, this is not only true for writing. The same applies to all language skills, including reading, listening, and speaking. Each of these skills enables us to engage with the world in different ways and to communicate effectively with others. For example, reading can help us access and evaluate different sources of information, while listening can help us understand others' perspectives and build relationships. Effective communication thus requires proficiency in all language skills, as well as the ability to use them strategically in different contexts.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>        What is active listening?</p><p>Active listening is the ability to focus completely on a speaker, understand their message, comprehend the information and respond thoughtfully. Unlike passive listening, which is the act of hearing a speaker without retaining their message, this highly valued interpersonal communication skill ensures you’re able to engage and later recall specific details without needing information repeated.</p><p></p><p>Active listeners use verbal and non-verbal techniques to show and keep their attention on the speaker. This not only supports your ability to focus, but also helps ensure the speaker can see that you are focused and engaged. Instead of thinking about and mentally rehearsing what you might say when the speaker is done, an active listener carefully considers the speaker’s words and commits the information to memory.</p><p><strong>workplace?</strong></p><p><strong>Whether you’re seeking a new job opportunity, striving to earn a promotion or working to improve in your current role, improving your active listening skills will help you succeed. Much like critical thinking and conflict resolution, this soft skill will help increase your value as an employee.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Being an active listener can help you accomplish the following:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Build connections</strong></p><p><strong>Active listening helps others feel comfortable sharing information with you. When you demonstrate your ability to sincerely listen to what others have to say, people will be more interested in communicating with you on a regular basis.

Imam, Maripaz Abas Mastura, Hajri Jamil and Zurida Ismail(Source: http://apice.usm.my/APJEE_29_2014/Art%205(81-94).pdf) Students need to develop scientific literacy in order to participate fully as citizens, community members, and in the globalised economy. Scientific literacy dictates that students should have the reading ability to evaluate the print-based information presented to them. Yet the level of performance in reading comprehension skills and performance in science of first year students in both public and private high schools in Cotabato City, Philippines are poor as indicated by their low mastery rating in the two learning areas. Students seemed to be struggling with both the content of science as well as the skills needed to be a proficient reader. With respect to the overall association between elements of reading comprehension skills and performance in science, it establishes a significant positive correlation but such relationship is negligible. As a whole, the poor performance of Filipino students in science which contributed to bad image of Philippine education both local and abroad can be well expounded by other relevant factors outside the scope of six reading comprehension skills.​</h2><br />
