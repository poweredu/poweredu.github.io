                                            Long, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy. Shining was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death. Just at sundown, when his day's work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it, and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re- crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they lost and confues, but he gave no heed. One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward - ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the "abandoning of the aged." what your understand this story​</a>

                                            what is the summary of The Aged Mother?eto yung storyLong, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy.Shining was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death.Just at sundown, when his day’s work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it, and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they lost and confues, but he gave no heed. One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged.”The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain’s many paths and his return might be one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that as they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother onto it. Hew rapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell.The trembling mother’s voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. “Let not thine eyes be blinded, my son.” She said. “The mountain road is full of dangers. LOOK carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar path farther down.” The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground, he cried aloud: “oh, Honorable mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I will not leave you. Together we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die!”Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now) and hastened down the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the valley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered and hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with everything she needed, continually watching and fearing she would be discovered. Time passed, and he was beginning to feel safe when again the governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order, seemingly as a boast of his power. His demand was that his subjects should present him with a rope of ashes.The entire province trembled with dread. The order must be obeyed yet who in all Shining could make a rope of ashes? One night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother. “Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” On the second day she told him what to do. “Make rope of twisted straw,” she said. “Then stretch it upon a row of flat stones and burn it on a windless night.” He called the people together and did as she said and when the blaze died down, there upon the stones, with every twist and fiber showing perfectly, lay a rope of ashes.The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised greatly, but he demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom. “Alas! Alas!” cried the farmer, “the truth must be told!” and with deep bows he related his story. The governor listened and then meditated in silence. Finally he lifted his head. “Shining needs more than strength of youth,” he said gravely. “Ah, that I should have forgotten the well-known saying, “with the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom!” That very hour the cruel law was abolished, and custom drifted into as far a past that only legend.​</a>

For the Angeles Family, Mr. Angeles’s homecoming from his periodic inspection trips was an occasion for celebration.
But his homecoming-from a trip to the South-was fated to be more memorable than, say, of the others.
He had written from Mariveles; “I have just met a marvelous mat weaver a real artist-and I shall have a surprise for
you. I asked him to weave a sleeping mat for everyone in the family. He is using many different colors and for each the
dominant color is that of our respective birthstones. I am sure that the children will be very pleased. I know you will be. I can
hardly wait to show them to you.”
Nana Emilia read that letter that morning again and again every time she had a chance to leave the kitchen. In the
evening when all the children were home from school, she asked her oldest son, Jose, to read the letter at dinner table. The
children became very much excited about the mats and talked about them until late into the night. These thoughts made her
wrote her husband. For days after that, mats continued to be the chief topic of conversation among the children.
Mr. Angeles travelled to southern Philippines and brought mats for his wife and children. Each mat has the
corresponding name of all his living offspring, even those who already died. When he arrived home from his trip, he presented
the mats to his family. The sorrow heightened when the last three mats he opened are for his dead children who made his
wife reacted with grief.
At that point, Mr. Angeles cried with pain while telling his wife that the three dull colored mats were for Josefina,
Victoria and Concepcion. He added that his three dead children must always be in their memory no matter where they are
now.

(Cambridge.org) It is a tale that grew out of the lives and imaginations of the people or folk (www2.nklust.edu tw). happy relieved worried sad angry Long time ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy. Shinano was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. happy relieved worried sad angry The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death. Just at sundown, when his day's work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they got lost and confused, but he gave no heed One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the "abandoning of the aged." The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain's many paths and his return might be one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that as they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother onto it. He wrapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell. happy relieved worried sad angry​</a>

For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school. Learning to follow school rules early on helps kids understand why rules are important well into adulthood. So, we should follow school rules!​</a>

                                            THE STORY OF THE AGED MOTHER A Japanese Folktale Long, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and their humble were peaceful and happy. Shinano was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not common. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought to second time about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was consider the kindest mode of death. Just at sundown, when his day's work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which is principal food for poor, cooked and dried it, and tying it in a square cloth, swung and bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and stated on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrowed road was crossed and recrossed by many pa made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they mingled in a confused puzzle, but he gave no heed. Or path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward- ever upward towards the high bare summ of what is known as Obatsuyama, "the mountain of the abandoning of aged". The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain's many paths and his return mi one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequently intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth ge released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen p meedle, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifting his old mother therein, he wrapped her padded coat more c about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart said farewell. The trembling mother's voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. "Let not thin blinded, my son. "She said "The mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and follow the path which iles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar way farther down". The son's surprised eyes looked back ov ath, then at the poor old, shriveled hands ali scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart smote hin owing to the grounds, he cried aloud: "oh, Honorable mother, thy kindness thrusts my heart! I will not leav er we will die!"1. setting2. character3.conflic4.moral​</a>

LOOK carefully and follow the path which holds the piles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar path farther down.” The son’s surprised eyes looked back over the path, then at the poor old, shriveled hands all scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart broke within and bowing to the ground, he cried aloud: “oh, Honorable mother, your kindness breaks my heart! I will not leave you. Together we will follow the path of twigs, and together we will die!”Once more he shouldered his burden (how light it seemed now) and hastened down the path, through the shadows and the moonlight, to the little hut in the valley. Beneath the kitchen floor was a walled closet for food, which was covered and hidden from view. There the son hid his mother, supplying her with everything she needed, continually watching and fearing she would be discovered. Time passed, and he was beginning to feel safe when again the governor sent forth heralds bearing an unreasonable order, seemingly as a boast of his power. His demand was that his subjects should present him with a rope of ashes.The entire province trembled with dread. The order must be obeyed yet who in all Shining could make a rope of ashes? One night, in great distress, the son whispered the news to his hidden mother. “Wait!” she said. “I will think. I will think” On the second day she told him what to do. “Make rope of twisted straw,” she said. “Then stretch it upon a row of flat stones and burn it on a windless night.” He called the people together and did as she said and when the blaze died down, there upon the stones, with every twist and fiber showing perfectly, lay a rope of ashes.The governor was pleased at the wit of the youth and praised greatly, but he demanded to know where he had obtained his wisdom. “Alas! Alas!” cried the farmer, “the truth must be told!” and with deep bows he related his story. The governor listened and then meditated in silence. Finally he lifted his head. “Shining needs more than strength of youth,” he said gravely. “Ah, that I should have forgotten the well-known saying, “with the crown of snow, there cometh wisdom!” That very hour the cruel law was abolished, and custom drifted into as far a past that only legend.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>"The Aged Mother" is a Japanese folktale about a cruel ruler who issues a decree that all old people must be put to death. A farmer and his mother try to escape the decree by fleeing to a distant mountain, where they meet an old woman who helps them. The old woman reveals that she is the spirit of the mountain and gives the farmer a magic paddle that will make him invisible. The farmer uses the paddle to return to his village and save the other elderly people by convincing the ruler to rescind his decree. The story highlights the importance of respecting and caring for the elderly, and the wisdom and guidance they can offer.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The story is about a poor farmer and his aged mother who lived in a province ruled by a despotic leader. The governor ordered the immediate death of all aged people, which filled the farmer's heart with sorrow as he loved his mother with tender reverence. He decided to carry his helpless old mother to the summit of the mountain of the “abandoning of the aged” where he was supposed to leave her to die. However, the mother dropped twigs along the way to guide her son back down the mountain. The son decided to take his mother back with him and hide her beneath the kitchen floor of their hut. Later, when the governor demanded a rope of ashes, the son sought his mother's help who advised him to make a rope of twisted straw and burn it on a windless night. When the governor discovered the truth behind the son's wisdom, he abolished the cruel law of abandoning the aged.</p><br />

He had written from Mariveles; “I have just met a marvelous mat weaver a real artist-and I shall have a surprise for

dominant color is that of our respective birthstones. I am sure that the children will be very pleased. I know you will be. I can
hardly wait to show them to you.”
Nana Emilia read that letter that morning again and again every time she had a chance to leave the kitchen. In the
evening when all the children were home from school, she asked her oldest son, Jose, to read the letter at dinner table. The
children became very much excited about the mats and talked about them until late into the night. These thoughts made her
wrote her husband. For days after that, mats continued to be the chief topic of conversation among the children.
Mr. Angeles travelled to southern Philippines and brought mats for his wife and children. Each mat has the
corresponding name of all his living offspring, even those who already died. When he arrived home from his trip, he presented
the mats to his family. The sorrow heightened when the last three mats he opened are for his dead children who made his
wife reacted with grief.
At that point, Mr. Angeles cried with pain while telling his wife that the three dull colored mats were for Josefina,
Victoria and Concepcion. He added that his three dead children must always be in their memory no matter where they are
now.

                            12. Having lived in the city all of your life, you know people well and feel they are especially 
friendly to everyone. Age, health, race, gender, education, ethnicity and family status 
have never mattered. Recently your aunt divorced her husband due to his lengthy 
sentence given for a crime against humanity. That’s all your parents would tell you 
about this situation. Because your aunt is undergoing chemotherapy for an illness no 
one will discuss, you learn that your cousin will be coming to stay with you for at least 
half of the school year. You and your cousin are one year apart; that’s good because 
you will be able to introduce him to your friends and even double date together. As you 
prepare to share your bedroom, you tell your friends that he’s coming within the week. 
Then the doorbell rings. You are upstairs, so your mother answers the door. You can 
hear people talking in hushed tones, and occasionally words such as “AIDS, risky 
business, welfare, trashy people, divorce, communicable disease, and dirt bags” pass 
your ears. You hear the door slam as Mom’s sobs echo throughout the house. Dad is 
enraged when he comes home from work and hears what happened.  
Using  the  decision-making  process,  determine  what  you  will  do  in  an  attempt  to 
remedy this series of questionable events and save face for your family. Based on 
this scenario, students will answer the question where he/she believe the responsibility 
of the family is the greatest – to the larger society as a whole or to protect individual 
family members. Would  you feel the same if the story involved turning in a drug

They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and they were humble, peaceful, and happy. Shinano was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not uncommon. happy relieved worried sad angry The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought twice about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep and hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was considered the kindest mode of death. Just at sundown, when his day's work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which was the principal food for the poor, and he cooked, dried it and tied it in a square cloth, which he swung in a bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and started on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrow road was crossed and re-crossed by many paths made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they got lost and confused, but he gave no heed One path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward -- ever upward towards the high bare summit of what is known as Obatsuyama, the mountain of the "abandoning of the aged." The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain's many paths and his return might be one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that as they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequent intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth gently released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen pine needles, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifted his old mother onto it. He wrapped her padded coat more closely about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart he said farewell. happy relieved worried sad angry​</h2><br />

These rules often address responsibilities like being on time. being prepared, being courteous to staff and other students, being respectful of property, doing your best and following any other rules that the school sets forth.While some students may see the rules as unnecessary or simply a way for teachers and administrators to control them. Following school rules can be extremely important for safety. ensuring everyone has an equal chance at learning and preparing kids for the future.                Rules Foster Safety for Everyone. One of the main reasons school rules exist is to create safety for students. Above all else, teachers and administrators want to ensure that everyone arrives at school safely and makes it home in good shape. For this reason, there may be some basic safety rules, such as no running in the halls, no crossing the street without help from the guard, no horseplay on the playground and no bringing items that could be used as weapons to school. Learning to follow school rules early on helps kids understand why rules are important well into adulthood. So, we should follow school rules!​</h2><br />
                        <strong>THE ISSUE:maybe making the rules less strict will be a lot more easier for student. THE POINT OF VIEW:this rules are also good but some of them are just way to strict.THE EVIDENCE:students can take care of themself and maybe they will learn from their own mistakes by letting them have fun and letting them learn from their mistakes THE EXAMPLE:for example no running in the hallway what if they are late? they are still gonna keep walking what if there is an emergency? maybe making it less strict wont hurt right?</strong><p><strong>Explanation: </strong><strong>the</strong><strong> </strong><strong>issue </strong><strong> is the idea that u are weiting about the </strong><strong>point of view</strong><strong> is your opinion about </strong><strong>the issue</strong><strong> the </strong><strong>evidence</strong><strong> is the reasons you are using to support your argument the </strong><strong>examples</strong><strong> provide support and help to illustrate the reasons.</strong></p><p></p><br />

                            18. THE STORY OF THE AGED MOTHER A Japanese Folktale Long, long ago there lived at the foot of the mountain a poor farmer and his aged, widowed mother. They owned a bit of land which supplied them with food, and their humble were peaceful and happy. Shinano was governed by a despotic leader who though a warrior, had a great and cowardly shrinking from anything suggestive of failing health and strength. This caused him to send out a cruel proclamation. The entire province was given strict orders to immediately put to death all aged people. Those were barbarous days, and the custom of abandoning old people to die was not common. The poor farmer loved his aged mother with tender reverence, and the order filled his heart with sorrow. But no one ever thought to second time about obeying the mandate of the governor, so with many deep hopeless sighs, the youth prepared for what at that time was consider the kindest mode of death. Just at sundown, when his day's work was ended, he took a quantity of unwhitened rice which is principal food for poor, cooked and dried it, and tying it in a square cloth, swung and bundle around his neck along with a gourd filled with cool, sweet water. Then he lifted his helpless old mother to his back and stated on his painful journey up the mountain. The road was long and steep; the narrowed road was crossed and recrossed by many pa made by the hunters and woodcutters. In some place, they mingled in a confused puzzle, but he gave no heed. Or path or another, it mattered not. On he went, climbing blindly upward- ever upward towards the high bare summ of what is known as Obatsuyama, "the mountain of the abandoning of aged". The eyes of the old mother were not so dim but that they noted the reckless hastening from one path to another, and her loving heart grew anxious. Her son did not know the mountain's many paths and his return mi one of danger, so she stretched forth her hand and snapping the twigs from brushes as they passed, she quietly dropped a handful every few steps of the way so that they climbed, the narrow path behind them was dotted at frequently intervals with tiny piles of twigs. At last the summit was reached. Weary and heart sick, the youth ge released his burden and silently prepared a place of comfort as his last duty to the loved one. Gathering fallen p meedle, he made a soft cushion and tenderly lifting his old mother therein, he wrapped her padded coat more c about the stooping shoulders and with tearful eyes and an aching heart said farewell. The trembling mother's voice was full of unselfish love as she gave her last injunction. "Let not thin blinded, my son. "She said "The mountain road is full of dangers. Look carefully and follow the path which iles of twigs. They will guide you to the familiar way farther down". The son's surprised eyes looked back ov ath, then at the poor old, shriveled hands ali scratched and soiled by their work of love. His heart smote hin owing to the grounds, he cried aloud: "oh, Honorable mother, thy kindness thrusts my heart! I will not leav er we will die!"1. setting2. character3.conflic4.moral​</h2><br />
