Human behavior, which serves as an adaptive tool for the varied stimuli projected by the environment, is influenced by beliefs, practices, and material possessions. 3. The concepts of nationality and ethnicity are NOT interchangeable but are capable of informing an individual's behavior and habits due to a set of cultural norms that each category provides. 4. Individuals who are attracted to multiple types of gender identity belong to polysexual orientation. 5. Unlike sex, gender categories are more varied. 6. The transsexual believes that the discord between their internal gender and the gender role that they have to perform can be addressed through medical sexual reassignment. 7. Filipinos' income and value of assets are factors that indicate social class in the Philippines. 8. The earliest forms of religion revolved around making sense of natural occurrences such as extreme conditions, natural and man-made calamities, sickness, and even death. 9. Human variation is predicted by the plurality of cultural and environmental conditions. 10. When faced with a plurality of culture, one must adapt the conceptual tool of cultural relativism, which promotes the perspective that cultures must be understood in the context of their locality.​</a>

                                            Our Wildlife, Our Treasure 'Various sources describe wildlife as the many kinds of plants and animals that grow and live in the wild. The animals in this classification have very little contact with humans; thus, they are undomesticated or wild. Included in the Philippine wildlife are birds, reptiles, and amphibians, of which there are 1,437 species of this, 711 species are endemic or native to our country. S. SY 29. vedia Commons The water that surrounds our archipelago is teeming with corals and is home to more than 2,000 species of fish. Our coral reefs have attracted tourists who marvel at their beauty. Our forests boast of different species of animals. Among these are the Philippine crocodile found in Mindoro, the tarsler of Bohol, the bearcat, the mouse deer or pilandok of Palawan, the pygmy Carlos SY 20, comma fruit bat, and the Philippine eagle in Mindanao. Our country is also a rich habitat for different plants. The pitcher plant, which is actually a camivorous plant; the Philippine teak tree, which grows up to 25 meters high, the almaciga, an evergreen large tree, the Philippine date palm; and some orchids are among these. But while we boast of these blessings, many of these species are threatened or endangered. This is why the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has taken steps to stop the further destruction and loss of Philippine wildlife. "Undersecretary Rodolfo Garcia of DENR said that "public action and cooperation on protecting wildlife would help bolster government's campaign to curb trafficking and other crimes against this natural resource." Republic Act 9147 or the Wildlife Resources Conservation and Protection Act defines wildlife as 'wild forms and varieties of flora and fauna, in all developmental stages, including those which are in captivity or are being bred or propagated."five world plant and animals help maintain not right balance there are also use it to flow the new high birds of plant and animals and and conducting experiment this feature of filipinos when they encounter this plant and animals match 3 forever year is named word wednesday or wwd  by the united nations connected general assembly beneficial you not help and conservation ​</a>

Included in the Philippine wildlife are birds, reptiles, and amphibians, of which there are 1,437 species of this, 711 species are endemic or native to our country. S. SY 29. vedia Commons The water that surrounds our archipelago is teeming with corals and is home to more than 2,000 species of fish. Our coral reefs have attracted tourists who marvel at their beauty. Our forests boast of different species of animals. Among these are the Philippine crocodile found in Mindoro, the tarsler of Bohol, the bearcat, the mouse deer or pilandok of Palawan, the pygmy Carlos SY 20, comma fruit bat, and the Philippine eagle in Mindanao. Our country is also a rich habitat for different plants. The pitcher plant, which is actually a camivorous plant; the Philippine teak tree, which grows up to 25 meters high, the almaciga, an evergreen large tree, the Philippine date palm; and some orchids are among these. But while we boast of these blessings, many of these species are threatened or endangered. This is why the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) has taken steps to stop the further destruction and loss of Philippine wildlife. "Undersecretary Rodolfo Garcia of DENR said that "public action and cooperation on protecting wildlife would help bolster government's campaign to curb trafficking and other crimes against this natural resource."
