 A. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm.
 B. But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.
 C. Then all shouted mirthfully, and leaped about the room. The Widow Wycherly—if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow—tripped up to the doctor's chair, with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face.
 D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</a>

This was also a sign of cooperation and goodwill between the two major working sectors of the town, the farmers and the fishermen. It was however a drunken guest, during a certain affair which decided on the final name, who said "Mabuhay ang Palanyag at ang mga taga-Palanyag! (Long live Palanyag and the people of Palanyag!)"

His wife retumed from the plantationand started to prepare the midday meal. The children, however, did not come in from the field ofmillet when she called to them.5 There in the middle of the field were the children, dancing away, and all around them were thebirds, singing and eating up the millet. When the children tried to shoo them away, waving theirarms and crying, it did not seem to disturb the birds at all.6 "When we came early in the morning, they were already here, and we tried to shoo them away.really we did, and they hopped around a bit, but they would not fly away, and then they began tosing and then we began to dance, we just had too and now we are dancing and they are singingand you must join us!, said the children."7 Annoyed and worried, the wife scolded the children for letting the birds fool them like that. Thenshe ran about to shoo them away but not one of them flew off.8 Then she began to dance to the rhythm, she just had to, and her children joined her.9 Now the husband was still at home, waiting for lunch.

 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</a>

Rocks when exposed to the environment tend to break down. It is said that rocks
experience weathering. Physical weathering also known as (7)
Weathering refers to the breakdown of rocks without a change in its composition. Chemical
weathering is the decomposition of rocks due to (8) _reactions occurring between the

 A. A strange chillness, whether of the body or spirit they could not tell, was creeping gradually over them all. They gazed at one another, and fancied that each fleeting moment snatched away a charm.
 B. But the doctor's four friends had taught no such lesson to themselves. They resolved forthwith to make a pilgrimage to Florida, and quaff at morning, noon, and night, from the Fountain of Youth.
 C. Then all shouted mirthfully, and leaped about the room. The Widow Wycherly—if so fresh a damsel could be called a widow—tripped up to the doctor's chair, with a mischievous merriment in her rosy face.
 D. With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</h2><br />

With a shuddering impulse, that showed her a woman still, the widow clasped her skinny hands before her face, and wished that the coffin-lid were over it, since it could be no longer beautiful.</p><p>This excerpt reveals the allegorical nature of the story because it shows that the character of the widow is symbolic of the idea of aging and the loss of beauty. She wishes that the coffin-lid were over her face, since it could be no longer beautiful, which is a metaphor for death and the end of life. This passage is showing how the characters in the story are symbols for deeper concepts and ideas.</p><br />

                            19. Which three pieces of evidence support the idea that the people do not know what the star is?
 adapted from The Star and the Lily
 by Hamilton Wright Mabie
 At night the people met on the wide green—the ah-nung-o-kah—and watched the stars. One night they saw a star that shone brighter than all others, its location seemingly far away in the south, near a mountain peak. For many nights it was seen, until it was doubted by many that the star was as distant as it seemed to be. This doubt led to an examination, which proved the star to be only a short distance away. Warriors were sent to see what it was, and upon their return they said it appeared strange and somewhat like a bird. A committee was called at once to ascertain the meaning of the unusual phenomenon.
 By the time one moon had gone by, the mystery still remained unsolved. Then, one night a young warrior had a dream in which the star came and stood at his side, and said, "Young brave, I have come to dwell among you!" Then, the young man awoke, but on stepping out of his lodge he saw the star still in its accustomed place. At early dawn, every warrior was called to the council lodge. When all were gathered, the young warrior related his dream, and the council concluded that the star that had been seen in the south had fallen in love with mankind and wanted to live among them. So, the next night, five braves were sent to welcome the stranger to earth and as they returned to the village, the star, with expanded wings, followed and hovered till the dawn of day.</h2><br />
