                                            YOU NEED TO TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR FUTUREThere are three kinds of people in this world:The first is the Moviegoer. This person watches the movie of their lives, admires some parts and criticizes others. Aside from that, they do nothing else. All she says the whole day is, “I like this thing and but I don’t like that thing.” The Moviegoer feels she has absolutely no control of their lives --- except to comment about it. Moviegoers are the most pathetic, miserable people in the world.The second is the Actor. This person does not only watch the movie of her life. She actually realizes she’s the Actor – and can control a big part of her life. She can actually make or break the movie – by how well she delivers her lines and how she portrays her character. Actors are a happy bunch, realizing they’re the start of the show and enjoy some level of control. But many times, they wish the movie would end in another way – but realize that they have no say in such things.The third is the Scriptwriter. This person does not only watch, and she doesn’t only act, but she actually creates the entire movie from her mind. She determines what she will say, what she will do, and how the movie will end. She realizes she has enormous control over her life, and sees to it that the movie of her life will turn out beautiful.QUESTIONS:1.) who are you among those three people? and why? 2.) what does the story tries to convey about getting to know everything? 3.) how does knowing oneself better make a person accept his/her strengths and limitations, anr improve the way he deals with others? ​</a>

                                            Pliant Like a Bamboo
IV Mallari 
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which the stronger of the two was, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
 The wind blew it hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of it. But finally its roots gave way, and it tumbled down.
 The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protests, but it let the winds have their way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
 Filipinos are like bamboos. They know that they are not strong enough to withstand the onslaughts of superior forces, so they yield. They bend their heads gracefully with many loud protests.
 They have survived. The Spaniards came and dominated them for more than three hundred years. When the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood-only much richer in experience and culture.
 The Americans took the place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos who embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniards' vague promise of the hereafter.
 Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence rude, relentless and cruel. The Filipinos learned to bow their heads low to "cooperate" with the Japanese in their "holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere." The Filipinos had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but they learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their "benevolence and magnanimity."
 Now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
 For the Filipinos will welcome any kind of life that the gods offer them; that is why they are contented, happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not theirs. To them, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision, but today, well-lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow, a vision of hope. In like manner, the Filipino regards vicissitudes of fortune as the bamboo tree regards the angry blasts of the blustering wind.
 The Filipinos are eminently suited to their romantic role. They are slender and wiry. They are nimble and graceful in their movements. Their voices are soft and have the gift of languages. In what other place in the world can you find people who can carry on a fluent conversation in at least three languages?
 This gift is another means by which the Filipinos have managed to survive. There is no insurmountable barrier between them and any of the people who have come to live with them - Spanish, Americans, Japanese. The foreigners do not have to learn their language. They easily manage to master theirs.
 Verily, the Filipinos are like the bamboo tree. In their grace and ability to adjust to the peculiar and inexplicable whims of fate, the bamboo tree is their expressive and symbolic national tree. It will have to be, not the molave nor the narra, but the bamboo.

                                            Pliant Like the Bamboo By Ismael V. MallariThere is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was strongest of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.The winds blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. Butfinally its roots gave way, and it tumbled down.The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protests, but it let the winds have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.The Filipino is like the bamboo. He knows that he is not strong enough to withstand the onslaughts of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protests.And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.The Americans took the place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means ofwinning over the Filipinos who embraced the American way of life more readily than theSpaniards’ vague promise of the hereafter.Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plaque of locusts, like a pestilencerude, relentless and cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity.”And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese,those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.For the Filipino will welcome any kind of life that the gods offer him. That is why,he is contented, happy and at peace. The sad plight of other peoples of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the pastis already a dream and tomorrowin only avision but today, well-lived makes everyyesterday a dream of happiness andevery tomorrow, a vision of hope. In likemanner, the Filipino regards vicissitudesof fortune as the bamboo tree regardsthe angry blasts of the blustering wind.The Filipino is eminently suitedto his romantic role. He is slender andwiry. He is nimble and graceful in hismovements. His voice is soft, and hehas the gift of languages. In what otherplace in the world can you find peoplewho can carry on a fluent conversationin at least three languages?This gift is another means by whichthe Filipino has managed to survive. Thereis no insurmountable barrier between himand any of the people who have come tolive with him — Spanish, Americans,Japanese. The foreigners do not have tolearn his language. He easily manages tomaster theirs.Verily, the Filipino is like the bambootree. In its grace, in its ability to adjust itselfto the peculiar and inexplicable whims to fate,the bamboo tree is his expressive and symbolicnational tree. It will have to be, not the molavenor the narra, but the bamboo.PA answer thank you ​</a>

It would not yield, I knen it was strong and sturdy It would not sway It was too proud It was too sure of tell But finally its roots gave way, and it tumbled down The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew it bent its head gracefully It made loud protests, but it let the winds have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree sill stood in all its beauty and grace The Filipino is like the bamboo He knows that he is not strong enough to withstand the onslaughts of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protests And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood-only much richer in experience and culture The Americans took the place of the Spaniards. They used more sublie means of winning over the Filipinos who embraced the Amencan way of life more readily than the Spaniards' vague promise of the hereafter Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plaque of locusts, like a pestilence rude, relentless and cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low to cooperate with the Japanese in their "holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere "The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned lo smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their "benevolence and magnanimity." And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines For the Filipino will welcome any kind of life that the gods offer him. That is why he is contented, happy and at peace. The sad plight of other peoples of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient oriental poet, the past is already a dream and tomorrowin only a vision but today, a vision of hope. In like manner, the filipino regards vicissitudes of fortune as the bamboo tree regards the angry blasts of the blustering wind.          The filipino is eminently suited to his romantic role. He is slender and wiry. He is nimble and graceful in his movements. His voice is soft, and he has the gift of languages. In what other place in the world can you find people who can carry on a fluent conversation in at least three languages?          The gift is another means by which the filipino has managed to survive. There is no insurmountable barrier between him and any of the people who have come to live with him ---- Spanish, Americans, Japanese. The foreigners do not have to learn his language. He easily manages to master their.           Verily, the filipino is like the bamboo tree. In its grace, in its ability to adjust itself to the peculiar and inexplicable whims to fate, the bamboo tree is his expenssive and symbolic national tree. It will have to be, not the molave nor the narra, but the bamboo.Use the Venn diagram to compare and contrast the qualities of a filipino and of the bamboo plant. write at least three distinct qualities and four similarities.pahelp Naman Po salamat sa sasagot Po.​</a>

                            7. Pliant Like a Bamboo
IV Mallari 
There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which the stronger of the two was, they called upon the wind to make the decision.
 The wind blew it hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of it. But finally its roots gave way, and it tumbled down.
 The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protests, but it let the winds have their way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.
 Filipinos are like bamboos. They know that they are not strong enough to withstand the onslaughts of superior forces, so they yield. They bend their heads gracefully with many loud protests.
 They have survived. The Spaniards came and dominated them for more than three hundred years. When the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood-only much richer in experience and culture.
 The Americans took the place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means of winning over the Filipinos who embraced the American way of life more readily than the Spaniards' vague promise of the hereafter.
 Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plague of locusts, like a pestilence rude, relentless and cruel. The Filipinos learned to bow their heads low to "cooperate" with the Japanese in their "holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere." The Filipinos had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but they learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their "benevolence and magnanimity."
 Now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.
 For the Filipinos will welcome any kind of life that the gods offer them; that is why they are contented, happy and at peace. The sad plight of other people of the world is not theirs. To them, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the past is already a dream, and tomorrow is only a vision, but today, well-lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and every tomorrow, a vision of hope. In like manner, the Filipino regards vicissitudes of fortune as the bamboo tree regards the angry blasts of the blustering wind.
 The Filipinos are eminently suited to their romantic role. They are slender and wiry. They are nimble and graceful in their movements. Their voices are soft and have the gift of languages. In what other place in the world can you find people who can carry on a fluent conversation in at least three languages?
 This gift is another means by which the Filipinos have managed to survive. There is no insurmountable barrier between them and any of the people who have come to live with them - Spanish, Americans, Japanese. The foreigners do not have to learn their language. They easily manage to master theirs.
 Verily, the Filipinos are like the bamboo tree. In their grace and ability to adjust to the peculiar and inexplicable whims of fate, the bamboo tree is their expressive and symbolic national tree. It will have to be, not the molave nor the narra, but the bamboo.

                            16. Pliant Like the Bamboo By Ismael V. MallariThere is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamboo tree. Not being able to agree as to which was strongest of the two, they called upon the wind to make the decision.The winds blew its hardest. The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield. It knew it was strong and sturdy. It would not sway. It was too proud. It was too sure of itself. Butfinally its roots gave way, and it tumbled down.The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew, it bent its head gracefully. It made loud protests, but it let the winds have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree still stood in all its beauty and grace.The Filipino is like the bamboo. He knows that he is not strong enough to withstand the onslaughts of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protests.And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood—only much richer in experience and culture.The Americans took the place of the Spaniards. They used more subtle means ofwinning over the Filipinos who embraced the American way of life more readily than theSpaniards’ vague promise of the hereafter.Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plaque of locusts, like a pestilencerude, relentless and cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low to “cooperate” with the Japanese in their “holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere.” The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned to smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their “benevolence and magnanimity.”And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese,those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines.For the Filipino will welcome any kind of life that the gods offer him. That is why,he is contented, happy and at peace. The sad plight of other peoples of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient Oriental poet, the pastis already a dream and tomorrowin only avision but today, well-lived makes everyyesterday a dream of happiness andevery tomorrow, a vision of hope. In likemanner, the Filipino regards vicissitudesof fortune as the bamboo tree regardsthe angry blasts of the blustering wind.The Filipino is eminently suitedto his romantic role. He is slender andwiry. He is nimble and graceful in hismovements. His voice is soft, and hehas the gift of languages. In what otherplace in the world can you find peoplewho can carry on a fluent conversationin at least three languages?This gift is another means by whichthe Filipino has managed to survive. Thereis no insurmountable barrier between himand any of the people who have come tolive with him — Spanish, Americans,Japanese. The foreigners do not have tolearn his language. He easily manages tomaster theirs.Verily, the Filipino is like the bambootree. In its grace, in its ability to adjust itselfto the peculiar and inexplicable whims to fate,the bamboo tree is his expressive and symbolicnational tree. It will have to be, not the molavenor the narra, but the bamboo.PA answer thank you ​</h2><br />

                            25. resilience as a nation Pliant Like the Bamboo By Ismael V Mallari There is a story in Philippine folklore about a mango tree and a bamirno ten min being able to agree as to which was strongest of the two, they called upon the world to make the decision The winds blow its hardest The mango tree stood fast. It would not yield, I knen it was strong and sturdy It would not sway It was too proud It was too sure of tell But finally its roots gave way, and it tumbled down The bamboo tree was wiser. It knew it was not as robust as the mango tree. And so every time the wind blew it bent its head gracefully It made loud protests, but it let the winds have its way. When finally the wind got tired of blowing, the bamboo tree sill stood in all its beauty and grace The Filipino is like the bamboo He knows that he is not strong enough to withstand the onslaughts of superior forces. And so he yields. He bends his head gracefully with many loud protests And he has survived. The Spaniards came and dominated him for more than three hundred years. And when the Spaniards left, the Filipinos still stood-only much richer in experience and culture The Americans took the place of the Spaniards. They used more sublie means of winning over the Filipinos who embraced the Amencan way of life more readily than the Spaniards' vague promise of the hereafter Then the Japanese came like a storm, like a plaque of locusts, like a pestilence rude, relentless and cruel. The Filipino learned to bow his head low to cooperate with the Japanese in their "holy mission of establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere "The Filipino had only hate and contempt for the Japanese, but he learned lo smile sweetly at them and to thank them graciously for their "benevolence and magnanimity." And now that the Americans have come back and driven away the Japanese, those Filipinos who profited most from cooperating with the Japanese have been loudest in their protestations of innocence. Everything is as if the Japanese had never been in the Philippines For the Filipino will welcome any kind of life that the gods offer him. That is why he is contented, happy and at peace. The sad plight of other peoples of the world is not his. To him, as to that ancient oriental poet, the past is already a dream and tomorrowin only a vision but today, a vision of hope. In like manner, the filipino regards vicissitudes of fortune as the bamboo tree regards the angry blasts of the blustering wind.          The filipino is eminently suited to his romantic role. He is slender and wiry. He is nimble and graceful in his movements. His voice is soft, and he has the gift of languages. In what other place in the world can you find people who can carry on a fluent conversation in at least three languages?          The gift is another means by which the filipino has managed to survive. There is no insurmountable barrier between him and any of the people who have come to live with him ---- Spanish, Americans, Japanese. The foreigners do not have to learn his language. He easily manages to master their.           Verily, the filipino is like the bamboo tree. In its grace, in its ability to adjust itself to the peculiar and inexplicable whims to fate, the bamboo tree is his expenssive and symbolic national tree. It will have to be, not the molave nor the narra, but the bamboo.Use the Venn diagram to compare and contrast the qualities of a filipino and of the bamboo plant. write at least three distinct qualities and four similarities.pahelp Naman Po salamat sa sasagot Po.​</h2><br />

                            28. YOU NEED TO TAKE CHARGE OF YOUR FUTUREThere are three kinds of people in this world:The first is the Moviegoer. This person watches the movie of their lives, admires some parts and criticizes others. Aside from that, they do nothing else. All she says the whole day is, “I like this thing and but I don’t like that thing.” The Moviegoer feels she has absolutely no control of their lives --- except to comment about it. Moviegoers are the most pathetic, miserable people in the world.The second is the Actor. This person does not only watch the movie of her life. She actually realizes she’s the Actor – and can control a big part of her life. She can actually make or break the movie – by how well she delivers her lines and how she portrays her character. Actors are a happy bunch, realizing they’re the start of the show and enjoy some level of control. But many times, they wish the movie would end in another way – but realize that they have no say in such things.The third is the Scriptwriter. This person does not only watch, and she doesn’t only act, but she actually creates the entire movie from her mind. She determines what she will say, what she will do, and how the movie will end. She realizes she has enormous control over her life, and sees to it that the movie of her life will turn out beautiful.QUESTIONS:1.) who are you among those three people? and why? 2.) what does the story tries to convey about getting to know everything? 3.) how does knowing oneself better make a person accept his/her strengths and limitations, anr improve the way he deals with others? ​</h2><br />
