 The Philippines’ Pandemic Response: A Tragedy of Errors
The Philippine government has been boasting that as early as March 16, they had the gumption to implement a lockdown in major cities and provinces in response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. However, Manila’s overall response to the pandemic has been fraught with incompetence and rife with terror. 
The implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) came on the heels of serious negligence — namely, the authorities failing to keep up with the preventive measures of neighboring countries and grossly underestimating the virus. What’s worse, instead of easing the overall burden that the virus unleashed on the country, it seems the last resort lockdown itself added to a plethora of problems without adequately addressing the primary crisis at hand: ensuring public health and safety.
Strict compliance with the ECQ is ordered for all citizens, with the exception of frontline professionals, until at least May 15. That has meant curfews, harsh penalties for being outside, and an impoverished population descending into hunger. 
The global crisis is first and foremost a public health issue, but Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has faced the coronavirus pandemic in a decidedly militaristic fashion. Since the lockdown went into effect, he has peddled the narrative of pasaways or “undisciplined” citizens as responsible for the ensuing problems. He has also brought up unsubstantiated activities of guerrilla groups as threats to government aid efforts without conceding any missteps in his management. On top of deploying thousands of police and soldiers throughout the archipelago to enforce the ECQ, Duterte has on two occasions threatened the public with all-out martial law. There have been moments of abject incompetence from those in power around the world, but using the pandemic as a reason for increasingly flexing authoritarian muscles spells danger for the Philippines post-lockdown.</a>

The fact that electronic computers are now used for data processing has led the general public to believe that it is a mysterious, complicated science and that the computers are giant brains. Both of these ideas are false. A computer is basically just a high-speed adding machine that performs the functions it is told to. If the input data are varied even a little, the computer is unable to operate until it is programmed to accept the variations.

1. The Philippines’ Pandemic Response: A Tragedy of Errors
The Duterte administration’s COVID-19 response marries incompetence with militarism.
By Michael Beltran
May 12, 2020
The Philippine government has been boasting that as early as March 16, they had the gumption to implement a lockdown in major cities and provinces in response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. However, Manila’s overall response to the pandemic has been fraught with incompetence and rife with terror.

2. COVID-19: A promising cure for the global panic
ABSTRACT. The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID 19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeuticstargetingSARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.</a>

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)  
By: Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phase out. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule.
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the driver earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes- is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and mediocre premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in may cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminal- and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in passengers of ten jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was a great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading//unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats are small. Hongkong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

                                            Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.

                                            Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney (an excerpt)
Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phaseout. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
 But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic
rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve the traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule. 
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to
be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the drivers earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes-is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and medicare premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in many cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along a narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminals-and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in the passengers of 10 jeepneys but take up
only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepneys is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was great as emergency civilian transportation
during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading/unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and busses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait for long for passengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metroten by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats were small. Hong Kong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high
tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

 The Philippines’ Pandemic Response: A Tragedy of Errors
The Philippine government has been boasting that as early as March 16, they had the gumption to implement a lockdown in major cities and provinces in response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. However, Manila’s overall response to the pandemic has been fraught with incompetence and rife with terror. 
The implementation of the Enhanced Community Quarantine (ECQ) came on the heels of serious negligence — namely, the authorities failing to keep up with the preventive measures of neighboring countries and grossly underestimating the virus. What’s worse, instead of easing the overall burden that the virus unleashed on the country, it seems the last resort lockdown itself added to a plethora of problems without adequately addressing the primary crisis at hand: ensuring public health and safety.
Strict compliance with the ECQ is ordered for all citizens, with the exception of frontline professionals, until at least May 15. That has meant curfews, harsh penalties for being outside, and an impoverished population descending into hunger. 
The global crisis is first and foremost a public health issue, but Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has faced the coronavirus pandemic in a decidedly militaristic fashion. Since the lockdown went into effect, he has peddled the narrative of pasaways or “undisciplined” citizens as responsible for the ensuing problems. He has also brought up unsubstantiated activities of guerrilla groups as threats to government aid efforts without conceding any missteps in his management. On top of deploying thousands of police and soldiers throughout the archipelago to enforce the ECQ, Duterte has on two occasions threatened the public with all-out martial law. There have been moments of abject incompetence from those in power around the world, but using the pandemic as a reason for increasingly flexing authoritarian muscles spells danger for the Philippines post-lockdown.</h2><br />

1. The Philippines’ Pandemic Response: A Tragedy of Errors
The Duterte administration’s COVID-19 response marries incompetence with militarism.

The Philippine government has been boasting that as early as March 16, they had the gumption to implement a lockdown in major cities and provinces in response to the unfolding COVID-19 pandemic. However, Manila’s overall response to the pandemic has been fraught with incompetence and rife with terror.

2. COVID-19: A promising cure for the global panic
ABSTRACT. The novel Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by SARS-CoV-2, which is the causative agent of a potentially fatal disease that is of great global public health concern. The outbreak of COVID-19 is wreaking havoc worldwide due to inadequate risk assessment regarding the urgency of the situation. The COVID-19 pandemic has entered a dangerous new phase. When compared with SARS and MERS, COVID-19 has spread more rapidly, due to increased globalization and adaptation of the virus in every environment. Slowing the spread of the COVID 19 cases will significantly reduce the strain on the healthcare system of the country by limiting the number of people who are severely sick by COVID-19 and need hospital care. Hence, the recent outburst of COVID-19 highlights an urgent need for therapeuticstargetingSARS-CoV-2. Here, we have discussed the structure of virus; varying symptoms among COVID-19, SARS, MERS and common flu; the probable mechanism behind the infection and its immune response. Further, the current treatment options, drugs available, ongoing trials and recent diagnostics for COVID-19 have been discussed. We suggest traditional Indian medicinal plants as possible novel therapeutic approaches, exclusively targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its pathways.</h2><br />

Phase Out the Obsolete Jeepney  (an excerpt)  
By: Neal H. Cruz
If the jeepney strike pushes through today, the government should use it to phase out the jeepneys. This World War II relic should have been phased out a long time ago but successive administrations had no balls to go through with the phase out. They were afraid of the jeepney drivers who always threatened a strike when they were told to obey the law. And there were not enough buses to replace the jeepneys to service commuters.
But the jeepney, although a tourist attraction and a romantic example of folk art, is the principal source of the daily traffic jams. Its drivers are undisciplined, reckless and probably don’t know half of the traffic rules. Because of the huge number of vehicles in Metro Manila, there is only one way to improve traffic: make each and every driver, private and public, obey each and every traffic rule.
Jeepney drivers have gotten away for so long with murder by bribing corrupt policemen that it is a shock to them to be made to obey traffic rules and be fined if they violate them. Anarchy reigns in the streets because of them.
Although they are not in the driver’s seat, jeepney operators are also to blame for the anarchy. They make the drivers pay a flat rental (the boundary) for the jeepney. Whatever the driver earns in excess of the boundary, plus the cost of fuel and oil-and bribes- is his take home pay. So the driver is forced to break traffic rules so that he can earn as much as he can. But that is no excuse.
Perhaps if the operator pays his driver a regular salary, plus social security and mediocre premiums, and fixed times for trips, the driver would be less reckless and we would have more orderly traffic.
As for the jeepney terminals, they really are a source of traffic congestion. Try this: whenever you come to a traffic jam, trace the source and in may cases it would be a jeepney terminal. Jeepneys lined up along narrow street take up space intended for moving vehicles. Some jeepney routes are too short, which means more terminal- and bigger fares for passengers.
Another reason why the jeepney should be phased out is that it takes up too much road space and consumes more fuel for the number of passengers it can accommodate. One bus can take in passengers of ten jeepneys but take up only a fourth of the space occupied by the 10 jeepneys. In short, the jeepney is all right in the provinces where there is ample road space but not in a crowded metropolis like Metro Manila. It was a great as emergency civilian transportation during the Liberation days, but not anymore. Alas, it has become obsolete in the city.
The phase out doesn’t mean throwing the jeepneys into the junk heap and their drivers into the ranks of the jobless. There is a great need for the jeepney in many areas of the Philippines where there is a shortage of transportation. Send them there.
Where will the commuters ride without the jeepneys? Send in more buses with salaried drivers and conductors and fixed trip schedules so they don’t have to clog loading//unloading zones waiting for passengers. Organize the bus companies in Metro Manila into one super-consortium so that the bus ticket of one company can be used to transfer to another bus of a different company. This is to prevent passengers and buses clogging bus stops because they are waiting for the bus going exactly to where they are going. If transfers are allowed, they can board any bus going in the same direction (and the bus doesn’t have to wait long for passsengers) and then transfer to another bus at their convenience.
Encourage commuters to use the Metrotren by improving the coaches and having more trips.
Use the Pasig River. The Metro Ferry failed because there were not enough passengers mainly because the boats are small. Hongkong type shallow-drift ferries will certainly attract more passengers. Use the smaller boats during high tide to be able to pass under the bridges. Have another ferry service to Cavite City to relieve traffic on Coastal Road. (There used to be one; why was it discontinued?)

                            7. Read the paragraph below and answer the questions that follow.
The western world is in love with the concept of freedom. It is the most precious aspect of society. Whether it is the freedom of religion or speech, the freedom to choose our political leaders, or to pursue the life we choose without fear of interference from individuals or governments, freedom is essential and paramount in all things.
However, when we move from our societal craving for freedom to our personal lives, or the workplace, we seem ready to give up our freedom and are willing to put our happiness and our level of motivation in the hands of someone else. In the workplace we call this someone else "management". It becomes management's job to give us rewarding work, to motivate us, to make us into high-performing individuals and teams. We tell ourselves that our mechanical systems of rewards and punishments, measurements, strategies, or command and control structures get the behaviors that we want from our organizations. In short, we create these devices to help eliminate the need for the exercise of free will.
Koestenbaum and Block suggest that this "escape from freedom," as Erich Fromm called it, is in large part due to the fact that "...with freedom comes accountability, and with accountability comes guilt, and with guilt comes anxiety.
But this creates an interesting paradox. By allowing others to choose I have made a choice. I have chosen to give others the power to choose for me, which in itself is an exercise of my free will. Therefore, I am still accountable, at least to myself, for the results of my decision.
Arguments are sure to be put forward showing how, at least in certain circumstances, I had no choice in the matter: "I hate this job, but if I don't come to work I will be fired. I have no choice but to come to work." Or, "The law says I have to pay my taxes. I have no choice. If I don't pay my taxes I will go to jail."
When these statements are examined more closely we see that there is an element of choice in each. I choose to continue to go work at a job that I hate because I am unwilling to deal with the consequences of walking away from the job. Instead of choosing to look for another job, I choose to continue working at the one I have. I am accountable for my choice to continue in an unpleasant job instead of changing my situation. I choose to pay my taxes because I am not willing to be accountable for the consequences related to not paying my taxes. Regardless of why I made the choice to pay my taxes, it is still my choice to make the payment.
We are not always in control of the alternatives among which we may choose. Having free will does not imply that life will always be perfect, or that the choice of another option would have provided us with great happiness. But through the exercise of our free will we are able to embrace our humanity, and to take on the succession of risks that life has to offer.
Recognizing that we are free gives us the ability to exercise control over our existence, and lets us shift from blaming others for how things are to being accountable for our life. "Once the
 inevitability [that we are accountable] is recognized, we will be inclined to place the full blame [or credit] on ourselves rather than on others or on objective situations beyond our control." (Freedom And Accountability At Work, Koestenbaum and Block, 2001, P. 79)
The good news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of opportunity. The bad news is that you have free will, and that opens up a world of accountability.
1. How are Freedom and Accountability related to each other? Explain clearly and comprehensively.
