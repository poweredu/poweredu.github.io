                                            The Glitch By Divina P. Maming Dela Cruz family came together for breakfast. Each had his/her own story to tell about his/her experiences for the week. This is the usual scenario every Sunday morning. "Good morning kids!" greeted the mother who had just finished setting the table for five. Tonio and Maria could not wait to reach for their chairs with a big grin on their faces as they said, "Good morning, nanay!" Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother. "Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo," she remarked. "Yeah, I know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today," she answered. Criselda replied, "I can’t wait to taste it!" Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on, his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged his shoulders for disappointment. "Let’s eat!" mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they saw him in a really low spirit. "What happened?" at last, the wife asked. "I may lose my job," he said with a croaky voice. "But why?" Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked towards him and patted his shoulder. "It’s okay. You can still find another job," she said offering him a seat. The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, "Tatay, don’t worry, we are here to help." 7 CO_Q1_Oral Communication SHS Module 2 "Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours," Tonio said. "Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income," Maria added. Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores. "Thank you, my dear children," was all Aling Terie could say. Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their activities in school and how they fared in their subjects. Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, "I got highest score in Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate." Tonio then mentioned about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked about what she learned from it. Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call. As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work the next day again. All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all together. "We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual," Mang Cardo sighed with relief. Now, answer the following questions: 1. What are the different communication scenarios in the story? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 2. How did each communication scenario develop? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 3. Did a conflict arise in the story? What kind of conflict is it? Did it affect the communication process? Was it resolved? How? How did the rest of the family members react to it? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 4. How can we establish a good communication? ___________________________________________________________________________ ___________________________________________________________________________ 5. What is the importance of communication in our daily life?</a>

                                            The Glitch
By Divina P. Maming
Dela Cruz family came together for
breakfast. Each had his/her own
story to tell about his/her
experiences for the week. This is the
usual scenario every Sunday
morning.
“Good morning kids!” greeted the
mother who had just finished
setting the table for five. Tonio and
Maria could not wait to reach for
their chairs with a big grin on their
faces as they said, “Good morning,
nanay!”
Criselda walked out from her room, still sleepy, her hair unkempt, her sleepwear on
but appeared equally thrilled as her siblings shared the table with their mother.
“Nanay, I can smell the aroma of your best delicacy, adobo,” she remarked. “Yeah, I
know. It is the favorite of the family so adobo is what I prepared today,” she
answered. Criselda replied, “I can’t wait to taste it!”
Mang Cardo, the man of the family, is a clerk in one of the rural banks in town. He
was talking to somebody over the phone; his voice echoed excitement but later on,
his positive mood gradually vanished. As he turned towards the table, he shrugged
his shoulders for disappointment.
“Let’s eat!” mother exclaimed, wanting to turn the situation around. But everybody
seemed to have been overwhelmed by their father’s silence. It was the first time they
saw him in a really low spirit. “What happened?” at last, the wife asked.
“I may lose my job,” he said with a croaky voice.
“But why?” Aling Terie was surprised and so were the children. She quickly walked
towards him and patted his shoulder. “It’s okay. You can still find another job,” she
said offering him a seat.
The children also let their father feel their support as they smilingly uttered, “Tatay,
don’t worry, we are here to help.”

“Yes, we will assist nanay in selling fish in the market after school hours,” Tonio said.
“Maybe we can add vegetables to sell too, for additional income,” Maria added.
Criselda, on the other hand, volunteered to do the home chores.
“Thank you, my dear children,” was all Aling Terie could say.
Mang Cardo was moved by his family’s gesture. He was not expecting for such an
all-out support. He felt good about it. He started asking his kids about their
activities in school and how they fared in their subjects.
Each of them excitedly told his own story. Criselda declared, “I got highest score in
Math, so my teacher rewarded me with a bar of chocolate.” Tonio then mentioned
about their project in Science which could eliminate foot smell and everyone poked
fun at it. They asked him whether they could try the product to see if it would really
work. Maria spoke about their field trip to the town’s historical heritage and talked
about what she learned from it.
Exchanges of stories persisted until someone gave Mang Cardo a ring. The ringing
lasted for some seconds and finally, he stood up to answer the call.
As he returned to the table, he was smiling. He was informed that the retrenchment
was not for him; it was a mistake. Now, the glitch is fixed and he is to report to work
the next day again.
All of them could not contain their happiness. And so, they sat down again to eat all
together. “We will go to the church after breakfast, as usual,” Mang Cardo sighed
with relief.

                                            In 2008 two Zimbabweans, Mr. and Mrs. Shumba, returned from the bankcarrying a bag full of money, $5 trillion in total. They had failed to buy maize-meal, sugar or cooking oil for the family as the foodstuffs were not available on the market. As Mr. Shumba sat down and pondered what to do for his family, he remembered how his grandfather used to sustain his large family with honey from the African wild bees. Mr. Shumba then made a decision to set up a bee-hive. He was helped by Mr. Hove to make a hive using locally available resources. Mr. Hove also asked for a bottle of honey, in return for his services and not money. After a while a swarm of bees had settled in the hive and before long, Mr. Shumba managed to harvest the honey for his family. He relied on the harvesting skills which his grandfather had taught him. He used some herbs which he burnt to make the bees drowsy during harvesting. In addition to the honey, the community also noticed that an edible berry shrub which had not produced fruit for a long time was now full of berries and more bird species could now be seen in the area. At the beginning of the next rainy season, two other varieties of berries and other small fruits returned. Children could be seen chasing a variety of colorful butterflies which they had not seen before. The community also noticed that many children no longer suffered from frequent bouts of colds and coughs as in the past. As the demand for honey increased Mr. Shumba set up two more hives and started selling the surplus. He could now pay school fees for his children. One day he went to the city to seek market opportunities. The following morning his wife phoned him to say that all the bee-hives had been burnt as someone from the community had tried to harvest honey illegally. Mr. Shumba was devastated by the loss and boarded the next bus to return home. As he sat in the bus on his long journey back home, he made up his mind that he was going to re-start the beekeeping project and started planning the new strategies he was going to use to ensure the future sustainability of the project.1. What benefits did the bees provide to Mr. Shumba and the environment?______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2. Make a list of some developments in this local community as a result of the beekeeping.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________3. What are the ecological, social and economic benefits of the bees?______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________4. How did burning the bees affect Mr Sumba‘s family, the community, the illegal harvester and the natural environment? ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________5. Suggest new strategies for Mr Shumba. How can we use this to build a sustainable community?______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________hum​</a>

He had grown old and could not run fast anymore. As days went by it became more and more difficult for him to hunt.One day while he was wandering through the forest in search of food, he came across a cave. He peeped in and smelt the air inside the cave. “Some animal must be staying here," he said to himself. He crept inside the cave only to find it empty. “I will hide inside and wait for the animal to return," he thought.The cave was the home of a jackal. Everyday, the jackal would go out in search of food and return to the cave in the evening to rest. That evening, the jackal after having his meal started towards home. But as he came closer, he felt something wrong. Everything around him very quiet. “Something is wrong," the jackal said to himself. “Why are all the birds and insects so silent?"Very slowly and cautiously, he walked towards his cave. He looked around him, watching for any signs of danger. As he got closer to the mouth of the cave, all his instincts alerted him of danger. “I have to make sure that everything is alright," thought the jackal. Suddenly, he thought of a plan.The clever jackal called out to the cave. “Hello my good cave, what happened to you today? Why are you so quiet?"The jackal’s voice echoed deep inside the cave. The lion, who by now could control his hunger no longer, thought to himself, “I think it is because I am here that the cave is silent. Before the jackal realises that something is wrong, I should do something."The jackal continued to call out, “Have you forgotten our agreement cave? You are supposed to greet me when I return home." The lion tried to make his voice sound hollow and called out from within the cave, “Welcome home my friend."The birds chirped loudly and flew away on hearing the lion’s roar. As for the jackal, he shook with fear. Before the hungry lion could pounce on him and eat him up, the jackal ran for his dear life as fast as his legs could carry him.The lion waited for a long while for the jackal to enter the cave. But when the jackal did not come in, the lion realised that he had been fooled. He cursed himself for his foolishness that made him lose a prey.​</a>

                            24. In 2008 two Zimbabweans, Mr. and Mrs. Shumba, returned from the bankcarrying a bag full of money, $5 trillion in total. They had failed to buy maize-meal, sugar or cooking oil for the family as the foodstuffs were not available on the market. As Mr. Shumba sat down and pondered what to do for his family, he remembered how his grandfather used to sustain his large family with honey from the African wild bees. Mr. Shumba then made a decision to set up a bee-hive. He was helped by Mr. Hove to make a hive using locally available resources. Mr. Hove also asked for a bottle of honey, in return for his services and not money. After a while a swarm of bees had settled in the hive and before long, Mr. Shumba managed to harvest the honey for his family. He relied on the harvesting skills which his grandfather had taught him. He used some herbs which he burnt to make the bees drowsy during harvesting. In addition to the honey, the community also noticed that an edible berry shrub which had not produced fruit for a long time was now full of berries and more bird species could now be seen in the area. At the beginning of the next rainy season, two other varieties of berries and other small fruits returned. Children could be seen chasing a variety of colorful butterflies which they had not seen before. The community also noticed that many children no longer suffered from frequent bouts of colds and coughs as in the past. As the demand for honey increased Mr. Shumba set up two more hives and started selling the surplus. He could now pay school fees for his children. One day he went to the city to seek market opportunities. The following morning his wife phoned him to say that all the bee-hives had been burnt as someone from the community had tried to harvest honey illegally. Mr. Shumba was devastated by the loss and boarded the next bus to return home. As he sat in the bus on his long journey back home, he made up his mind that he was going to re-start the beekeeping project and started planning the new strategies he was going to use to ensure the future sustainability of the project.1. What benefits did the bees provide to Mr. Shumba and the environment?______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________2. Make a list of some developments in this local community as a result of the beekeeping.______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________3.

How did burning the bees affect Mr Sumba‘s family, the community, the illegal harvester and the natural environment? ______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________5.

He had grown old and could not run fast anymore. As days went by it became more and more difficult for him to hunt.One day while he was wandering through the forest in search of food, he came across a cave. He peeped in and smelt the air inside the cave. “Some animal must be staying here," he said to himself. He crept inside the cave only to find it empty. “I will hide inside and wait for the animal to return," he thought.The cave was the home of a jackal. Everyday, the jackal would go out in search of food and return to the cave in the evening to rest. That evening, the jackal after having his meal started towards home. But as he came closer, he felt something wrong. Everything around him very quiet. “Something is wrong," the jackal said to himself. “Why are all the birds and insects so silent?"Very slowly and cautiously, he walked towards his cave. He looked around him, watching for any signs of danger. As he got closer to the mouth of the cave, all his instincts alerted him of danger. “I have to make sure that everything is alright," thought the jackal. Suddenly, he thought of a plan.The clever jackal called out to the cave. “Hello my good cave, what happened to you today? Why are you so quiet?"The jackal’s voice echoed deep inside the cave. The lion, who by now could control his hunger no longer, thought to himself, “I think it is because I am here that the cave is silent. Before the jackal realises that something is wrong, I should do something."The jackal continued to call out, “Have you forgotten our agreement cave? You are supposed to greet me when I return home." The lion tried to make his voice sound hollow and called out from within the cave, “Welcome home my friend."The birds chirped loudly and flew away on hearing the lion’s roar. As for the jackal, he shook with fear. Before the hungry lion could pounce on him and eat him up, the jackal ran for his dear life as fast as his legs could carry him.The lion waited for a long while for the jackal to enter the cave. But when the jackal did not come in, the lion realised that he had been fooled. He cursed himself for his foolishness that made him lose a prey.​</h2><br />
