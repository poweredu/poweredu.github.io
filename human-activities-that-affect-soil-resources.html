Your paragraph will be graded according to the criteria set in the rubrics on page 22. provided One of the environmental issues faced by many countries around the world is land pollution. Land pollution is the contamination and destruction of the earth's land surfaces due to human activities and misuse of land resources. There are many factors that contributed to this problem. One of the factors is when humans apply toxic chemicals such as insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides affecting the fertility and productivity of the soil. Another factor is the improper disposal of plastic wastes and garbage. Dumped garbage releases toxic gases that are harmful to humans as well as to the land surfaces. Factories cause land pollution too because they produce chemicals and toxic waste products which are damaging to the soil. Also, exploitation of minerals through mining has contributed to the contamination of the land. To sum up, these are the different factors that contributed to land pollution.

                                            ECOSYSTEMSEcosystems consist of living and non-living organisms in an area. These include plants, animals, microbes, and elements like soil, water, and air. The living organisms depend on both living and non-living aspects of an ecosystem.An ecosystem can be as small as a puddle or as big as an ocean. It is a very delicate balance, with these life forms sustaining one another. Disruptions to an ecosystem may prove disastrous to all its organisms. When a new plant or animal is suddenly placed in an ecosystem, it will surely compete with the original inhabitants for resources. This stranger may even push out the natural organisms, causing them to be extinct. The organisms that depended on the extinct organisms will definitely be affected.The balance in ecosystems have been unsettled by natural disasters such as fires, floods, storms, and volcanic eruptions. However, in recent years and ironically, in the name of progress, human activity has affected many ecosystems around the world.Questions1. Which among the following is NOT a good description for an ecosystem? a. animals and plants relying on each other to surviveb. a place where people are friendly to the environmentc. a biological community where organisms affect each otherd. a variety of living and non-living things in a particular area2. Why is an ecosystem considered to be a delicate balance? a. There are big ecosystems and small ecosystems that have to bebalanced.b. Not all ecosystems weigh the same so their weight needs to bedistributed.c. A change in an ecosystem can have tremendous effects on all itsorganisms.d. Different organisms always have equal importance in any given ecosystem. 3. Which of the following is NOT one of the natural disasters that have caused ecosystems to be unsettled?a. firesb. floodsc. stormsd. Humans4. Based on the selection, which of the following is true about human progress and ecosystems? a. Human progress sometimes causes ecosystems to suffer.b. Human activity promotes the development of ecosystems.c. Human activity helps find solutions to ecological problems.d. Human progress causes different ecosystems to be progressive.5.	According to the selection, a new organism introduced in an ecosystem can have an effect on an original inhabitant when _____.a. it fights with and eventually eats the original inhabitantb. it consumes resources intended for the original inhabitantc. it makes the original inhabitant feel strange in the ecosystemd. it contributes to disasters that upset the balance in the system6. What should human beings do in order to maintain the balance indifferent ecosystems? a. Cut down a lot of trees so that there is more space for animals to live in.b. Take corals from the sea so that fish would have more freedom to swim.c. Plant more trees in order to replace those that have been cut down.d. Catch a lot of tuna so that nothing will eat the mackerel or the small fish.7. The diagram below shows an ocean ecosystem. The arrows point to the food source of the succeeding organism. If a new organism is introduced into the system and it eats the shrimplike creatures, how will this indirectly affect the mackerel? a. The mackerel will have no more shrimplike creatures to eat.b. The mackerel will still be eaten by the tuna fish as it continues toconsume the small fish.c. The mackerel will be eaten by the small fish which now has to look for a new food source.d. The mackerel might lose its food since without a food source, the smallfish could die.8.Using the same diagram, which of the following statements is FALSE? a. The small fish depends solely on shrimplike creatures for food.b. The tuna fish depends solely on the mackerel as its food source.c. The large shark depends solely on the tuna fish as its food source.d. The shrimplike creatures depend solely on one-celled life for food​​</a>

                                            Read and analyze the paragraph below. Using the guide question make
a paragraph about preserving our environment.
One of the environmental issues faced by many countries around the world
is land pollution. Land pollution is the contamination and destruction of the earth’s
land surfaces due to human activities and misuse of land resources. There are many
factors that contributed to this problem. One of the factors is when humans apply
toxic chemicals such as insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides affecting the fertility
and productivity of the soil. Another factor is the improper disposal of plastic wastes
and garbage. Dumped garbage releases toxic gases that are harmful to humans as well
as to the land surfaces. Factories cause land pollution too because they produce
chemicals and toxic waste products which are damaging to the soil. Also, exploitation
of minerals through mining has contributed to the contamination of the land. To sum
up, these are the different factors that contributed to land pollution.</a>

We depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change. ______3. The main function of ecosystem conservation is protecting or restoring the structure, function and species compilation within the system. This can get hard quickly because everything in an ecosystem affects everything else. ______4. Mangroves are essential to maintaining water quality. With their dense network of roots and surrounding vegetation, they filter and trap sediments, heavy metals, and other pollutants. ______5. Coral reefs does protect coastlines from storms and erosion, provide jobs for local communities, and offer opportunities for recreation. ______6. The ecosystem is an environment where both living and non-living things exist and interact with one another Examples of ecosystem are the tropical rainforests, coral reefs, and mangrove swamps.______7. Coral reefs serve as habitat for many animals. They are the breeding ground of marine life. They are composed of living components only such as water and sand and living components such as fish, crustaceans, mollusks, cnidarians, sponges and echinoderms. ______8. Mangrove Swamps is an important system that allows for the breeding of fishes and survival of other marine animals.______9. Being responsible to the development and restoration of Earth's resources like the tropical rainforests, mangrove swamps and coral reefs is a key for the long-term benefits to mankind. ______10.

This means that the environment can provide the needs of theorganisms living there and can still provide these resources to futuregenerations.However, the environment can only support a limited population. Thisis referred to as the environment's carrying capacity. What are humanactivities that can affect an environment's carrying capacity? What mayhappen when the ecosystem has reached its maximum carrying capacity?Maintaining balance is important for the environment to become lifesustaining. Earth's resources are classified into two categories: renewable andnonrenewable.Renewable resources are those that can be used readily and producedor regenerated repeatedly (in one or two human lifetime) by nature's recyclingprocess and sound management practices of human beings. The air webreathe, the freshwater we drink, the light from the sun, the plants andanimals that we use as food are all examples of renewable resources. They areinfinite or inexhaustible when used and managed properly.Nonrenewable resources are those that have finite existence, that is,they cannot be replaced or regenerated easily (in one or two human lifetime);or the rate by which the regeneration process occur is so slow. Fossil fuels -coals, oil and natural gas and minerals from the soil are examples ofnonrenewable resources.​</a>

                        Note: You can just copy the first sentence or just few sentences because it’s a bit long but you can copy it all if you want.<br /><br />ANSWER:<br /><br />Deforestation<br /><br />•Affected or lost<br /><br />-The loss of trees and other vegetation can cause climate change, desertification, soil erosion, fewer crops, flooding, increased greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, and a host of problems for indigenous people.<br /><br />•Importance<br /><br />-Besides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change.<br /><br />Flashfloods<br /><br />•Affected or lost<br /><br />-Loss of Critical Infrastructure; Large debris and floodwaters can cause structural damage to bridges and roadways, making travel impossible.<br /><br />•Importance<br /><br />-The air we breathe: The ocean produces over half of the world's oxygen and absorbs 50 times more carbon dioxide than our atmosphere.<br /><br />Illegal mining<br /><br />•Affected or lost<br /><br />-Illegal mining activities were identified as the cause of environmental problems such as water pollution, deforestation, poor soil fertility and limited access to land for agriculture productivity.<br /><br />•Importance<br /><br />-Mountains are particularly important for their biodiversity, water, clean air, research, cultural diversity, leisure, landscape and spiritual values.<br /><br />Soil erosion<br /><br />•Affected or lost<br /><br />-The effects of soil erosion go beyond the loss of fertile land. It has led to increased pollution and sedimentation in streams and rivers, clogging these waterways and causing declines in fish and other species.<br /><br />•Importance<br /><br />-Land is considered the primary factor of production. Land is rich in coal, water and petroleum, which are used for generating power. Land is required to construct factories and industries to carry out the production process. Land is of great importance to mankind.<br /><br />Coral reef degradation<br /><br />•Affected or lost<br /><br />-Damaging activities include coral mining, pollution (organic and non-organic), overfishing, blast fishing, the digging of canals and access into islands and bays.<br /><br />•Importance<br /><br />-Coral reef structures also buffer shorelines against 97 percent of the energy from waves, storms, and floods, helping to prevent loss of life, property damage, and erosion.<br /><br />Oil spill<br /><br />•Affected or lost<br /><br />-The immediate environmental effects of oil spills have been readily identified, but their long-term impact on the ecological system of an affected area is more difficult to assess.<br /><br />•Importance<br /><br />-Separating oil from the water allows you to reuse both fluids in varying capacity.<br /><br />Pollution<br /><br />(Water Pollution)<br /><br />•Affected or lost<br /><br />-If a water source becomes contaminated due to pollution, it can lead to health issues in humans, such as cancer or cardiovascular conditions.<br /><br />•Importance<br /><br />-Our bodies use water in all the cells, organs, and tissues, to help regulate body temperature and maintain other bodily functions.<br /><br />(Air Pollution)<br /><br />•Affected or lost<br /><br />-Long-term health effects from air pollution include heart disease, lung cancer, and respiratory diseases such as emphysema. Air pollution can also cause long-term damage to people's nerves, brain, kidneys, liver, and other organs.<br /><br />•Importance<br /><br />-Air is important for living things.<br />Breathing is part of a process called respiration. During respiration, a living thing takes in oxygen from the air and gives out carbon dioxide. This process gives animals and plants the energy to eat, grow, and live life!<br /><br />(Soil Pollution)<br /><br />•Affected or lost<br /><br />-Soil pollution also causes the loss of soil and natural nutrients present in it, hindering plants ability to thrive in such soil, which would further result in soil erosion and disturbing the balance of flora and fauna residing in the soil.<br /><br />•Importance<br /><br />-Healthy soils are essential for healthy plant growth, human nutrition, and water filtration. Healthy soil supports a landscape that is more resilient to the impacts of drought, flood, or fire. Soil helps to regulate the Earth's climate and stores more carbon than all of the world's forests combined.<br /><br /><br />Hope It Helps!<br />

                            15. ECOSYSTEMSEcosystems consist of living and non-living organisms in an area. These include plants, animals, microbes, and elements like soil, water, and air. The living organisms depend on both living and non-living aspects of an ecosystem.An ecosystem can be as small as a puddle or as big as an ocean. It is a very delicate balance, with these life forms sustaining one another. Disruptions to an ecosystem may prove disastrous to all its organisms. When a new plant or animal is suddenly placed in an ecosystem, it will surely compete with the original inhabitants for resources. This stranger may even push out the natural organisms, causing them to be extinct. The organisms that depended on the extinct organisms will definitely be affected.The balance in ecosystems have been unsettled by natural disasters such as fires, floods, storms, and volcanic eruptions. However, in recent years and ironically, in the name of progress, human activity has affected many ecosystems around the world.Questions1. Which among the following is NOT a good description for an ecosystem? a. animals and plants relying on each other to surviveb. a place where people are friendly to the environmentc. a biological community where organisms affect each otherd. a variety of living and non-living things in a particular area2. Why is an ecosystem considered to be a delicate balance? a. There are big ecosystems and small ecosystems that have to bebalanced.b. Not all ecosystems weigh the same so their weight needs to bedistributed.c. A change in an ecosystem can have tremendous effects on all itsorganisms.d. Different organisms always have equal importance in any given ecosystem. 3. Which of the following is NOT one of the natural disasters that have caused ecosystems to be unsettled?a. firesb. floodsc. stormsd. Humans4. Based on the selection, which of the following is true about human progress and ecosystems? a. Human progress sometimes causes ecosystems to suffer.b. Human activity promotes the development of ecosystems.c. Human activity helps find solutions to ecological problems.d. Human progress causes different ecosystems to be progressive.5.	According to the selection, a new organism introduced in an ecosystem can have an effect on an original inhabitant when _____.a. it fights with and eventually eats the original inhabitantb. it consumes resources intended for the original inhabitantc. it makes the original inhabitant feel strange in the ecosystemd. it contributes to disasters that upset the balance in the system6. What should human beings do in order to maintain the balance indifferent ecosystems? a. Cut down a lot of trees so that there is more space for animals to live in.b. Take corals from the sea so that fish would have more freedom to swim.c. Plant more trees in order to replace those that have been cut down.d. Catch a lot of tuna so that nothing will eat the mackerel or the small fish.7. The diagram below shows an ocean ecosystem. The arrows point to the food source of the succeeding organism. If a new organism is introduced into the system and it eats the shrimplike creatures, how will this indirectly affect the mackerel? a. The mackerel will have no more shrimplike creatures to eat.b. The mackerel will still be eaten by the tuna fish as it continues toconsume the small fish.c. The mackerel will be eaten by the small fish which now has to look for a new food source.d. The mackerel might lose its food since without a food source, the smallfish could die.8.Using the same diagram, which of the following statements is FALSE? a. The small fish depends solely on shrimplike creatures for food.b. The tuna fish depends solely on the mackerel as its food source.c. The large shark depends solely on the tuna fish as its food source.d. The shrimplike creatures depend solely on one-celled life for food​​</h2><br />

                            16. Read and analyze the paragraph below. Using the guide question make
a paragraph about preserving our environment.
One of the environmental issues faced by many countries around the world
is land pollution. Land pollution is the contamination and destruction of the earth’s
land surfaces due to human activities and misuse of land resources. There are many
factors that contributed to this problem. One of the factors is when humans apply
toxic chemicals such as insecticides, pesticides, and herbicides affecting the fertility
and productivity of the soil. Another factor is the improper disposal of plastic wastes
and garbage. Dumped garbage releases toxic gases that are harmful to humans as well
as to the land surfaces. Factories cause land pollution too because they produce
chemicals and toxic waste products which are damaging to the soil. Also, exploitation
of minerals through mining has contributed to the contamination of the land. To sum
up, these are the different factors that contributed to land pollution.</h2><br />
                        <p>Preserving our environment is crucial to ensure the wellbeing of both ecosystems and human beings. One of the most pressing issues we face today is the problem of land pollution. This type of pollution comes from the destruction and contamination of land surfaces due to human activities. A variety of factors contribute to this problem, including the use of toxic chemicals, improper disposal of plastic and other waste, and industrial practices. To minimize land pollution, we must take steps to reduce the use of harmful chemicals and find safer ways to dispose of waste. Recycling and proper waste management practices can also help. Additionally, we must promote sustainable industrial practices that prioritize the wellbeing of the environment. Finally, we must seek to end exploitative mining practices that contribute to land contamination. Only through collaborative efforts and conscious action can we preserve our environment for generations to come.</p><br />

What mayhappen when the ecosystem has reached its maximum carrying capacity?Maintaining balance is important for the environment to become lifesustaining. Earth's resources are classified into two categories: renewable andnonrenewable.Renewable resources are those that can be used readily and producedor regenerated repeatedly (in one or two human lifetime) by nature's recyclingprocess and sound management practices of human beings. The air webreathe, the freshwater we drink, the light from the sun, the plants andanimals that we use as food are all examples of renewable resources. They areinfinite or inexhaustible when used and managed properly.Nonrenewable resources are those that have finite existence, that is,they cannot be replaced or regenerated easily (in one or two human lifetime);or the rate by which the regeneration process occur is so slow. Fossil fuels -coals, oil and natural gas and minerals from the soil are examples ofnonrenewable resources.​</h2><br />

If the population exceeds the carrying capacity for a long period of time, resources may be completely depleted. Populations may die off if all of the resources are exhausted.</p><br />
