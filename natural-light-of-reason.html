9. The distance of an observer from two identical kinds of light sources varies. Light source A is 200 centimeters away while the light source B is 300 centimeters away from the observer. Does light source A give higher light intensity than light source B? 
A. Yes, because it is away from the observer 
B. Yes, because it is much closer to the observer 
C. No, because the distances of light source vary 
D. No, because its distance is closer from the observer 
10. The intensity of light is inversely proportional to the distance from the eye of the observer. Which of the following statements explain the relationship between intensity and distance? 
I. As the distance increases, the intensity of light decreases because it spreads out over a larger surface area. 
II. When the distance increases, the intensity of light increases because the light rays compressed in larger surface area. 
III. If the distance increases, the intensity of light decreases because light waves spread out more in its surrounding.

                                            Natural philosophers have long pondered the underlying reasons for color in nature. One common historical belief was that colored objects in nature produce small particles (perhaps light particles) that subsequently reach our eyes. Different objects produce different colored particles, thus contributing to their different appearances. Is this belief accurate or not? Justify your answer.</a>
