                                            Should our school have a civilian attire day? by Mary Catherine Siena (An Excerpt) High school students like us, who are mostly teenagers, find many ways to express ourselves. Sometimes, we like to express ourselves through art like those cool drawings and paintings we find in our Visual Arts classroom or the small doodles we draw in our notebooks. However, one of the simplest ways we express ourselves is through the clothes that we wear. Hence, I believe that we should have a day for civilian attire. Source: Language in Literature K to 12 (2020) Questions: 1. Based on the text, what are some ways people express themselves? 2. Are these ways similar to or different from the way you express yourself? If so, in what ways are they the same or different? 3. What is the purpose of the author in writing the essay? 4. Do you agree or disagree with the author's stance? Explain.​</a>

Sometimes people get locked into certain personas and thoughts, where the monotony of an average workweek hinders spontaneity, novelty, and the imagination. By shaking things up in creative and artistic ways, it paves the way for enlightenment and personal development.</p><p></p><p>Doodle</p><p></p><p>While high school teachers might have scolded you for doodling in class, science advocates a wandering hand, as doodling boosts creativity and productivity. Take time in the day to doodle between work tasks or when on a phone call. Such artistic skill can inspire new thoughts, leading to greater success at work. You can also purchase an adult coloring book, as coloring is both soothing and stimulating, and it has been shown to enhance mental health and reduce stress.</p><p></p><p>Visit A Museum Or Gallery</p><p></p><p>Instead of taking a standard lunch break at a nearby coffee shop or scarfing down your meal at your desk, go to a museum or art gallery and browse a few exhibits, surrounding yourself with art, science, and innovation. If your office is too far away, plan to stop into a gallery after work or head to the museum on a weekend. Aim for consistency, as honoring an appreciation for art on a regular basis will keep your mind stimulated.</p><p></p><p>Take Photos</p><p></p><p>Snapping a few photos on your phone or camera will allow you to capture life’s finest moments and display them in an artful and creative manner. Once you’ve taken the photos, go through a few filters and settings on your phone to add more personality and warmth. You can also develop the pictures to create a photo album or scrapbook, as a fun, artistic project to balance out more tedious, work tasks.</p><p></p><p>Take An Art Class</p><p></p><p>Whether you want to learn the practice through an art program or simply take a class with a friend for a fun, Friday night activity, signing up for an art class can activate the mind and act as an outlet for stress release and self-expression. There are plenty of creative and artistic classes to choose from, such as, painting, pottery, sculpture, and poetry. Even less obvious options, such as a cooking class, can spark new culinary adventures and hone your craft.</p><p></p><p>Get In Touch With Your Inner Child</p><p></p><p>There’s an innocence and buoyancy to childhood, and as we age, that lighthearted nature seems to fade, due to stress and life obligations that come with adulthood. Being playful can engage the mind and body in stimulating, inspirational, ways to drive personal growth and create a balanced life. Plan a laser tag or bowling event with friends, or head to a nearby karaoke bar and belt out a few tunes. You can also go to a local comedy or improvisation show to boost spontaneity and cultivate curiosity for new activities that urge you to step outside your comfort zone.</p><p></p><p>Taking the time to release inhibitions and enjoy experimentation can foster the creative spirit and take the mind and body to new and exciting heights. By opening yourself up to different avenues and experiences, you’ll make room for greater balance and fulfillment in your personal and work ventures.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>✍︎</p><br />

                            10. Should our school have a civilian attire day? by Mary Catherine Siena (An Excerpt) High school students like us, who are mostly teenagers, find many ways to express ourselves. Sometimes, we like to express ourselves through art like those cool drawings and paintings we find in our Visual Arts classroom or the small doodles we draw in our notebooks. However, one of the simplest ways we express ourselves is through the clothes that we wear. Hence, I believe that we should have a day for civilian attire. Source: Language in Literature K to 12 (2020) Questions: 1. Based on the text, what are some ways people express themselves? 2. Are these ways similar to or different from the way you express yourself? If so, in what ways are they the same or different? 3. What is the purpose of the author in writing the essay? 4. Do you agree or disagree with the author's stance? Explain.​</h2><br />
