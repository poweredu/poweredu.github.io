It empowers people to be critical thinkers and makers, effective communicators andactive citizens.2. Is the set of abilities requiring individuals to recognize when information is needed,and how to locate, evaluate, and use it effectively.3. It builds an understanding of the role of media in society as well as essential skills ofinquiry and self-expression necessary for citizens of a democracy.4. The ability to use digital technology, communication tools or networks to locate,evaluaie, use, and create information.5. It is about helping students become competent, critical and literate in all media formsso that they control the interpretation of what they see or hear rather than letting theinterpretation control them.6. It is how we navigate the complex to the networked world of the internet.7. It has been transformed to be the primary source for research, complementing whatcan be found in school libraries.8. Ii refers to the essential competencies (knowledge, skills and attitude) that allowcitizens to engage with media and other information providers effectively and develop criticalthinking and life-long learning skills for socializing and becoming active citizens9. It is not to memorize facts or statistics about the media, but rather to learn to raise theright questions about what you are watching, posting, reading or listening to.10.

In what ways can you minimize the disruption of the biogeochemicalcycles and its effect on the environnent?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. Energy is transferred between trophic levels when one organism eats another and gets the energy-rich molecules from its prey's body. However, these transfers are inefficient, and this inefficiency limits the length of food chains.</p><p></p><p>2. biogeochemical cycle are found everywhere around us.</p><p></p><p>Many biogeochemical cycles affect our daily lives in many ways. A prime example of one of these cycles is the water cycle. The constant changing states of water and how it interacts with our environment ( both gas, ice, and liquid states). Some key words with the water cycle include condensation, precipitation, and evaporation</p><p></p><p>Another great example in our everyday lives is the flow of oxygen and carbon dioxide. The constant respiration from animals and photosynthesis from plants creates a constant cycle which has been continuing for millions of years.</p><p></p><p>Other cycles include the nitrogen cycle, phosphorus cycle, and sulfur cycle. Even today scientists are beginning to discover new cycles such as weather patterns, and human impact on the environment, which can drastically change the speed, intensity, and balance of these relatively unknown cycles.</p><p></p><p>3. A biogeochemical cycle is a process where a type of element moves through nature. An element moves through nature by the break down and build up of molecules the element is a part of. To give an example, think about carbon. Carbon is present in gaseous CO2 in the atmosphere. Vegetation sequesters CO2 through photosynthesis. Plants turn CO2 into sugars to store energy absorbed by the sun. These sugars are then stored by the plant for later catabolic purpose.</p><p></p>#CarryOnLearning<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>*SHIELD*</p><p>TYPE OF MAGMA-basaltic magma</p><p>Shield volcanoes are composed almost entirely of relatively thin lava flows built up over a central vent. Most shields were formed by low viscosity basaltic magma that flows easily down slope away form the summit vent.</p><p>SHAPE OF VOLCANO-Shield volcanoes, the third type of volcano, are built almost entirely of fluid lava flows. Flow after flow pours out in all directions from a central summit vent, or group of vents, building a broad, gently sloping cone of flat, domical shape, with a profile much like that of a warrior's shield</p><p>MATERIALS IN VOLCANO- Shield volcanoes have small amounts of pyroclastic material, most of which accumulates near the eruptive vents, resulting from fire fuming events. Thus, shield volcanoes typically form from nonexplosive eruptions of low viscosity basaltic magma. ... Shield volcanoes have low slopes and consist almost entirely of lavas.</p><p></p><p></p><p>*COMPOSITE*</p><p>TYPE OF MAGMA-Andesitic.</p><p>Composite volcanoes have the following characteristics: Andesitic magma, which is lower in temperature, has more silica and a lot of dissolved gases and is more likely to explode when it reaches the surface. Acidic lava, which is very viscous (sticky). Steep sides as the lava doesn't flow very far before it solidifies.</p><p>SHAPE OF VOLCANO-Composite cones are tall, cone shaped volcanoes that produce explosive eruptions. Shield volcanoes form very large, gently sloped volcanoes with a wide base.</p><p>MATERIALS IN VOLCANO-Composite volcanoes—also called stratovolcanoes—are named for their composition. These volcanoes are built from layers, or strata, of pyroclastic material, including lava, pumice, volcanic ash, and tephra. ... Composite volcano magma is felsic, which means it contains silicate-rich minerals rhyolite, andesite, and dacite.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>*CINDER *</p><p>TYPE OF MAGMA-mafic</p><p>Cinder cones develop from explosive eruptions of mafic (heavy, dark ferromagnesian) and intermediate lavas and are often found along the flanks of shield volcanoes.</p><p>SHAPE OF VOLCANO-A cinder cone is a steep conical hill of loose pyroclastic fragments, such as volcanic clinkers, volcanic ash, or cinder that has been built around a volcanic vent. The pyroclastic fragments are formed by explosive eruptions or lava fountains from a single, typically cylindrical, vent.</p><p>MATERIALS IN VOLCANO -Cinder cones are the simplest type of volcano. They are built from particles and blobs of congealed lava ejected from a single vent. As the gas-charged lava is blown violently into the air, it breaks into small fragments that solidify and fall as cinders around the vent to form a circular or oval cone </p><p></p><p></p><p>sana po makatulong .</p><br />

                        <p>The Department of Education said Tuesday it has revised the basic education curriculum following a review, reducing learning competencies for the upcoming school year.</p><p></p><p>Learning competencies refer to the knowledge, understanding, skills and attitudes that students need to demonstrate in every lesson or learning activity, according to a 2015 DepEd order.</p><p></p><p>For School Year 2020 to 2021, the DepEd reduced learning competencies by 60 percent, retaining only 5,689 which were considered "most essential" from the original 14,171, according to a presentation delivered by Education Undersecretary Nepomuceno Malaluan at the House of Representatives on Monday.</p><p></p><p>Malaluan said the revised curriculum would be used "only for this year, for now."</p><p></p><p>"We will still review it again for longer term within the year," he told reporters in a Viber message.</p><p></p><p>In an earlier press briefing, Malaluan said the reduction was part of the K-12 curriculum review, which started almost 2 years ago, and aimed to address the overlaps in learning competencies.</p><p></p><p>K-12, a flagship education program of the past administration, had added two years to the education cycle, giving students more time to learn, with the goal of preparing them better for either college or qualification for employment even after high school.</p><p></p><p>"'Yong mga overlaps, 'yong unnecessary competencies, 'yong puwedeng i-merge, 'yon 'yong ginawa nila, at ima-map doon 'yong learning resources at io-orient ang mga guro kung paano ituturo," he said in a May 11 press briefing.</p><p></p><p>(The overlaps, unnecessary competencies and those that can be merged, we did it. The learning resources will be mapped from the competencies and teachers will be oriented on how to teach them.)</p><p></p><p>Malaluan added that all subjects would still be taught in the upcoming school year, which is set to start on August 24 - a later date set because of the coronavirus pandemic.</p><p></p><p>Schools are expected to implement various learning delivery modes in the upcoming school year as the country continued to grapple with the pandemic.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Hope is help Godblessss :)</p><br />
