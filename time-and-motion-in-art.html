                                            The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on. Question :How are you going to differentiate arts from nature. 2.State your reason why art is man-made. 3.How is art related to humanities? ​</a>

                            18. The art that we perceive through our eyes is called the visual art and architecture is one part of it. Visual arts involve not only painting and sculpture, but include such things as clothes, household appliances, and the furnishing of our homes, schools, churches, and other buildings. Out of the many common things we use in our daily lives, we can derive real pleasure. The aesthetic aspects of any work--a painting, a song, story, dance or play-are what make it art. Aesthetics refer to the forms and psychological effects of arts. Another form of the more important Arts is music. This is the art of combining and regulating sounds of varying pitch to produce compositions, ezoressing various ideas, and emotions.It's primary function is to entertain. Music is one of the great arts of civization,along with literate, painting, sculpture, architecture and dance. As an art, it bases its appeal on the sensuous beauty of musical sounds. Dance-is another form of art that is common to man even during the earliest times. It is the most direct of the arts for it makes use of the human body as its medium. It springs from our love for expressive gestures, release of tension through rhythmic movement. Dance heightens the pleasure of being, and at the sane time, mirrors the life of society. Moreover, the are of the theatre or drama is another of the important arts. Dramatic activities are usually part of every school &amp; community program. Classes dramatize the events they're studying, clubs or organisations and institutions stage plays. Going to the theatre to see a play is a wonderful experience. Play may e a comedy, tragedy, or mystery ,musical or melodrama. The motion picture--Popular addition to the various forms of the theatre. Through it, a lot of people are able to see dramatic performances everyday. Theatrical productions, including motion pictures &amp; television, combine art forms. In addition, the play itself is a form of literature. The opera, for example is a drama set to music. It is also necessary that we distinguish between art and nature for they are fundamentally different. We maybe impressed by the majestic cone of May on volcano, the awesome beauty of the sunset on Manila Bay, thus, react to the wonders of nature. No matter how close art is to nature, art akwats shows that its man- made. It is an interpretation of nature and life. ARTIST- An artist is a person who exhibits exceptional skills in design, drawing, painting, etc.or one who works in one of the performing arts, like an actor or musician. There are two kinds of artists--creactors and perfirmers. Example :A composer writes a song to be sung by talented singers. A dramatist of plagwright writes a play to be staged lby a company of actors. A choreographer composes a ballet or dance sequence which will be performed by a troupe of dancers. Music, theatre, and dance are performing arts. Besides the creator, they require other artists who recreate what has been composed. Thus, performers are important.The Work of thd Creative Artist - Creativity is an artist's trait developed in the course of her life to solve problems or express her feelings. Her continuing  reaction to emerging conditions of nature and social life gives birth to new ideas and new methods. These in turn, she uses to overcome difficulties which in the process of confrontation with reality give the solution to a vision, create art, or activate social transformation. The process of Creation-there are three major phrases in the process of Creation. First, the artist must have an idea, second, he must have a material to work on, and  third, he must give form to his idea. *The Idea - Artists are highly sensitive persons specially aware of the things that surround them. They notice the sound, color, and movements of people and things. Art expression is usually based on the so - called higher senses of sight &amp; sound. *The Material and Process-The second phrase of  creation in art concerns the material which the artist uses to give form to his idea. Example, a painter uses pigments a sculptor uses stone, metal, or wood, an architect various  building materials. An author uses words, a composer musical sounds which are the materials for his creations. *Organization and Form-The third phrase in creating is organizing the idea and giving it form in the selected material.Artists have developed a host of different forms to express the ideas they work on.

                        <p>The visual arts are a diverse range of art forms that primarily create works that are visual in nature. The elements of visual arts include line, shape, color, color schemes, and time and motion. Understanding these elements is crucial for artists to create aesthetically pleasing and unified works of art. I find it fascinating how visual arts have the ability to evoke emotions and communicate ideas through the use of these elements. The incorporation of actual motion in an artwork is also an interesting concept as it offers a unique experience for viewers. Overall, the visual arts are a powerful medium that can express and convey ideas in a unique and captivating way.</p><p></p><p>[tex]\\\[-Tricia[/tex]</p><br />
