                                            Digital marketing plays a valuable role in shaping consumer behavior in today’s world, Traditional advertising can cost large sums of money, whether it be via television, radio, newspaper, magazine, or direct mail. Now business owners can find a cheap equivalent online. Think YouTube instead of television, blogs instead of magazines, social media instead of flyers, and podcasts instead of the radio. Some of the digital equivalents to traditional advertising are free, and all can be much cheaper than their traditional counterparts if the business has someone to manage and develop its strategies.
The great thing about digital marketing is that those who use it can easily check their reputation and engage with unsatisfied customers, making it possible for them to address negative press before it circulates too far and too wide. Just because a business doesn’t take advantage of the web and social media doesn’t mean that its customers don’t. It is far better to know what is going on as it happens than to find out the hard way along with everyone else.</a>

The interchangeable relationship between the arts - as a cultural value offered to the public - and the general population that interacts with and embodies these values must perpetually rise upwards and never deviate - even marginally - downwards, not only with respect to heightening the esteem and taste for aesthetic beauty, but also on other levels such as revering the value of morality, virtue, hard work, science, defense of the motherland, as well as all the other values representing the backbone of the success and development of any contemporary civilized society. Accordingly, the role of artists in all categories: plastic arts, music and singing, drama, and poetry must rise to become an influentially positive element that pushes and supports this interchangeable relationship upwards and never downwards, particularly since the majority of artists constitute the cream of society and are revered and admired by the public.
