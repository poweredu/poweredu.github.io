                                            n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

Once upon a time in this beautiful lake surrounded by mountains and the sweetest mango trees lived a monkey.
The lake also had a few crocodiles. There was one crocodile who was very fond of the mangoes that fell from the tree.
 As the crocodile visited the mango trees every day, it became friends with the monkey. The two animals would meet
every day. The monkey helped the crocodile by providing him with the freshest mangoes from the tree. In return, the
crocodile would make the monkey laugh with his silly jokes. Their relationship continued and they became close pals.
One day, the monkey took more mangoes from the tree and asked the crocodile to give some to his wife. The
crocodile readily agreed thinking that this would make his wife happy.
True enough, the crocodile’s wife was pleased. “These are the best-tasting mangoes in the entire lake!” The wife
was so curious about the mangoes and asked her husband where he got the fruits from. The crocodile told her about his
close friend, the monkey.
Suddenly, the crocodile’s wife made an evil plan in her mind. She asked her husband, “Does your friend eat these
fruits daily? These are the sweetest fruits we ever ate. Imagine how delicious the monkey’s heart would be if he ate
these fruits daily! I need the heart of your friend. Can you please bring it for me?”
The crocodile was startled by his wife’s comments. He replied, “But he is my close friend. I can’t do this to him.”
The crocodile’s wife told him, “Don’t worry! You can drown your friend by pretending to push him down into the water if he
doesn’t know how to swim.”
The crocodile thought about it for a long time but he finally agreed to bring the monkey to his wife.
The next day, the crocodile invited the monkey to join him and his wife for lunch. The monkey happily agreed
to be the guest. However, the monkey expressed his inability to swim in the lake.
The crocodile offered to carry the monkey on his back even bringing him back to the mango trees. The monkey
accepted his offer and rode on his back. As they reached halfway to their destination, the crocodile went under the water
to drown the monkey.
However, the monkey did not fall because he held tightly to the crocodile. The monkey got suspicious about
the crocodile’s actions and asked him to tell the truth.
Since the crocodile believed the monkey was his good friend, he confessed to the monkey about the conversation
he had with his wife. He even confessed to his wife’s plans to eat his heart!
The monkey was quick to respond, “Oh my dear friend, you should have told me this earlier. I left my heart on one
of the branches of the mango tree as I won’t carry it if I travel long. If you take me back, I can give you my heart.”
The crocodile agreed and took the monkey back to his mango trees. As they reached the tree where the monkey
lived, the monkey climbed quickly and escaped from the crocodile. He shouted at Crocodile, “I thought you were a good
friend but you cheated on me! I will never go back with you and never be your friend.”
The crocodile understood his mistake and returned home empty-handed, losing a good friend indeed.

                                            Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                            5. n a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”

                            11. Read the story before answering:
Once upon a time in this beautiful lake surrounded by mountains and the sweetest mango trees lived a monkey.
The lake also had a few crocodiles. There was one crocodile who was very fond of the mangoes that fell from the tree.
 As the crocodile visited the mango trees every day, it became friends with the monkey. The two animals would meet
every day. The monkey helped the crocodile by providing him with the freshest mangoes from the tree. In return, the
crocodile would make the monkey laugh with his silly jokes. Their relationship continued and they became close pals.
One day, the monkey took more mangoes from the tree and asked the crocodile to give some to his wife. The
crocodile readily agreed thinking that this would make his wife happy.
True enough, the crocodile’s wife was pleased. “These are the best-tasting mangoes in the entire lake!” The wife
was so curious about the mangoes and asked her husband where he got the fruits from. The crocodile told her about his
close friend, the monkey.
Suddenly, the crocodile’s wife made an evil plan in her mind. She asked her husband, “Does your friend eat these
fruits daily? These are the sweetest fruits we ever ate. Imagine how delicious the monkey’s heart would be if he ate
these fruits daily! I need the heart of your friend. Can you please bring it for me?”
The crocodile was startled by his wife’s comments. He replied, “But he is my close friend. I can’t do this to him.”
The crocodile’s wife told him, “Don’t worry! You can drown your friend by pretending to push him down into the water if he
doesn’t know how to swim.”
The crocodile thought about it for a long time but he finally agreed to bring the monkey to his wife.
The next day, the crocodile invited the monkey to join him and his wife for lunch. The monkey happily agreed
to be the guest. However, the monkey expressed his inability to swim in the lake.
The crocodile offered to carry the monkey on his back even bringing him back to the mango trees. The monkey
accepted his offer and rode on his back. As they reached halfway to their destination, the crocodile went under the water
to drown the monkey.
However, the monkey did not fall because he held tightly to the crocodile. The monkey got suspicious about
the crocodile’s actions and asked him to tell the truth.
Since the crocodile believed the monkey was his good friend, he confessed to the monkey about the conversation
he had with his wife. He even confessed to his wife’s plans to eat his heart!
The monkey was quick to respond, “Oh my dear friend, you should have told me this earlier. I left my heart on one
of the branches of the mango tree as I won’t carry it if I travel long. If you take me back, I can give you my heart.”
The crocodile agreed and took the monkey back to his mango trees. As they reached the tree where the monkey
lived, the monkey climbed quickly and escaped from the crocodile. He shouted at Crocodile, “I thought you were a good
friend but you cheated on me! I will never go back with you and never be your friend.”
The crocodile understood his mistake and returned home empty-handed, losing a good friend indeed.

                            13. Taro, The Great Spider
By Menere R. Nasiad
In a small village called Nemen lived a giant spider named Taro. He lived in a small, dilapidated barn owned by an old merchant. When the merchant died, Taro was left with his goats and hens.
After several months, Taro was surprised to see his reflection through a glass window. He was huge! From then on, he had learned to live in the barn alone. He did nothing but spin webs and hid from the people.
The villagers knew about this giant spider, but they never dared to go near him for fear of being eaten. Some brave men who took the risk to see the enormous spider said it was harmless. Indeed, it was true. When they saw Taro’s willingness to help when a fire broke out in their village, they realized that not all huge creatures were monsters. Because of Taro’s bravery and his promise to protect the people of Nemen, he was trusted and respected by the villagers. Taro was called “Taro, The Great.” He earned friends who regularly visited the barn to bring food and water. When the people needed help, they called Taro right away. One night, a black squid appeared from the sea and walked through the farms. He destroyed all the plants and killed the animals around. Some animals ran in fear and made shrieking noises. Curious about the strange noises outside, the villagers took their lamps out and were surprised to see the black squid. Its eyes were bulging and burning red, and its mouth was surrounded by bits of meat and plants. The black squid used its mighty arms and tentacles to snatch little creatures away. It used its strength to destroy the whole village.
The villagers were helpless as they could not even go near the black squid. They were afraid of its poisonous tentacles. Some faced their fears and fought face to face with the black squid, but they lost and died. Taro could not believe what he saw: wrecked houses, ruined streets, and damaged farms. He saw the black squid going toward the direction of the forest. Taro hid behind large trees and waited for the black squid to fall asleep. The black squid took a deep yawn. The disgusting smell of its breath could make any living creature faint. Taro knew that when the sun came out, the black squid would go back to the sea.
“I cannot save the village alone. I have to go to the sea and ask for help from Andre, the sperm whale,” Taro said to the villagers who followed him. “How can we help you in this situation?” a man asked. “I need some men to lead the black squid back to the sea, where my web
waits for him. The black squid will be confined; therefore, he cannot move. I will ask Andre to drive the black squid far away from our village,” Taro told the villagers. Before the sun came up, the black squid howled and stood firm with all its might. With their ropes and knives on their sides, the men used all their strength to trap their foe. The black squid rushed toward them, but the men scattered around and ran back to the sea. Little did the black squid know that he was about to meet his doom. When the black squid was on the shore, Taro threw his orb-web over the black squid and entangled it. “I cannot move! What did you do to me?” the black squid was fuming mad. Taro whistled, and Andre came out and showed his huge, conical teeth.
“This is dinner,” Andre said. The villagers celebrated on that day. They expressed their gratitude to Taro, the great spider, for bringing peace to their homeland. Taro said, “We must protect our village. Together, we have to rebuild our place. We plant trees, clean our surroundings and protect our environment. We are all stewards of God’s creations.”
