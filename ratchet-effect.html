At the same time, check whether the ratchet is operating thoroughly. 3. ______If the required braking force can not be obtained or if you experience unusual brake performance or condition, perform maintenance check. Adjust, repair or replace if you encounter the following problem. 4. ______Brake fluid that are extracted because of the bleeding process shall be disposed properly. Said fluid is already contaminated andt should NEVER be re-use or mixed with new fluid. 5. _____The brake fluid in the entire hydraulic circuit must be replace at the specified tin (irregardless of damage or leak in the system). 6. _____The play of brake pedal is measured by pushing it with a finger until a resistance is felt on the pedal. Check the distance of the play if within the specified (or standard) value. 7. ____After adjusting the relationship between the pedal play and the pedal height, check the dimension between the pedal top face and the floor plate when the pedal is depressed (stepped) by a certain amount of force (see specifications). 8.____ After adjusting the relationship between the pedal play and the pedal height, check the dimension between the pedal top face and the floor plate when the pedal is depressed (stepped) by a certain amount of force (see specifications). 9. ____The number of notches varies according to the vehicle type. Verify the number of notches from the service manual. 10. ____ The play of brake pedal is measured by pushing it with a finger until a resistance is felt on the pedal. Check the distance of the play if within the specified (or standard) value. 11. ____With the parking brake applied and the engine running, step on the clutch pedal (disengage the clutch) and then move the gearshift lever to engage a certain gear, check whether the gear enters (engage) smoothly. 12. ____Wheel chocks are placed on the wheel, parking brake is fully applied, the transmission is placed into low gear, and then the clutch is engaged slowly. At this time, if the engine stops, there is no clutch skid (slippage). 13. ____If the dust boot has cracks, water, dirt's or foreign matters can enter the boot and will cause grease degradation which will damage the moving components. 14. ____At the time of low speed, wear of gears in a differential case or wear of a thrust washer. 15. ____At the time of rotation, Looseness and wear of bearings, such as in drive pinion and differential case; slack in ring gear; and lack of oil.pasagot ko please tomorrow na kasi ang final pass namin...​</a>

Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few

Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy

Whoever call me out, they simply can't count

I'ma say all the words inside my head

The way that things have been, oh-ooh
Second thing second
Don't you tell me what you think that I could be
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...
Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
First things first
Can you imagine what's about to happen?
It's Weezy the Dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come, don't come without strategy
I know the sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start with from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever call me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer?
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need no breather
Love you Ms. Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without hurt
Hol' up, hol' up, last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that glory don't come without...
Don't come without...

You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like...
