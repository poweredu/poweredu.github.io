                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Three years ago, I left America in grief to bury my husband, Ninoy Aquino. I thought I had left it also to lay to rest his restless dream of Philippine freedom. Today, I have returned as the president of a free people.</p><p></p><p>In burying Ninoy, a whole nation honored him. By that brave and selfless act of giving honor, a nation in shame recovered its own. A country that had lost faith in its future found it in a faithless and brazen act of murder. So in giving, we receive, in losing we find, and out of defeat, we snatched our victory.</p><p></p><p>For the nation, Ninoy became the pleasing sacrifice that answered their prayers for freedom. For myself and our children, Ninoy was a loving husband and father. His loss, three times in our lives, was always a deep and painful one.</p><p></p><p>Fourteen years ago this month was the first time we lost him. A president-turned-dictator, and traitor to his oath, suspended the Constitution and shut down the Congress that was much like this one before which I am honored to speak. He detained my husband along with thousands of others – senators, publishers and anyone who had spoken up for the democracy as its end drew near. But for Ninoy, a long and cruel ordeal was reserved. The dictator already knew that Ninoy was not a body merely to be imprisoned but a spirit he must break. For even as the dictatorship demolished one by one the institutions of democracy – the press, the Congress, the independence of the judiciary, the protection of the Bill of Rights – Ninoy kept their spirit alive in himself.</p><p></p><p>The government sought to break him by indignities and terror. They locked him up in a tiny, nearly airless cell in a military camp in the north. They stripped him naked and held the threat of sudden midnight execution over his head. Ninoy held up manfully–all of it. I barely did as well. For 43 days, the authorities would not tell me what had happened to him. This was the first time my children and I felt we had lost him.</p><p></p><p>When that didn’t work, they put him on trial for subversion, murder and a host of other crimes before a military commission. Ninoy challenged its authority and went on a fast. If he survived it, then, he felt, God intended him for another fate. We had lost him again. For nothing would hold him back from his determination to see his fast through to the end. He stopped only when it dawned on him that the government would keep his body alive after the fast had destroyed his brain. And so, with barely any life in his body, he called off the fast on the fortieth day. God meant him for other things, he felt. He did not know that an early death would still be his fate, that only the timing was wrong.</p><p><strong>I</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>o</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>e</strong><strong> </strong><strong>i</strong><strong>t</strong><strong> </strong><strong>h</strong><strong>e</strong><strong>l</strong><strong>p</strong><strong>s</strong><strong> </strong><strong>:</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>After listening to the speech I felt like I was taken back to the period the speaker was speaking. I felt connected to the want of freedom from oppression expressed by the speaker and the need for democracy. While listening to it, I realized how freedom is significant to a country, and we should let our voices be heard. Citizens should also unite together and fight against oppression. With the current country's condition, protection of the rights of all citizens should be prioritized as citizens voice their opinions against malicious doings by the government and oppressions.</p><br />

                            11. Cory Aquino's Speech, Make your own insights.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>One of the first lessons I learned in public office, is that as President, one is expected to lose one’s sense of humor. Or at least, in public. While in office, I have to learn to joke in private and to treat other people’s comments occasionally as jokes. Now that I will soon become one of you, I might as well allow for a smooth transition back to my sense of humor.
</p><p>
</p><p>Thus, I would like to begin by announcing my first joke for the evening. During the last stretch of the elections, I often heard businessmen say, “Pigang-piga na kami.” There was, as my Presidential Management Staff euphemistically described to me, “donor fatigue.” Well, seeing this crowd tonight, I guess the well is not really all that dry.
</p><p>
</p><p>After all, the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry had just concluded a most interesting multisectoral conference — if only to see whether or not in 100 days you can recover your contributions to the campaign kitty.
</p><p>
</p><p>End of joke.
</p><p>
</p><p>Indeed, I am truly pleased to be with you tonight, as I submit to you my promised assessment of the economic legacy I leave behind.
</p><p>
</p><p>For the past six years, an interminable debate has been going on between my economic and development managers, and the critics of my administration. Many times, my Cabinet has rolled with the punches; many more times, it has been punch-drunk. Both sides cite statistics. Both present arguments with cold, calculating logic. Some critics have accused my economic and development managers of treason. My managers in turn learned only too quickly, economics for development in this country, is not for the faint of heart. And economic development in this country, thank God and peoplepower, is as robust as robust can be.
</p><p>
</p><p>For you may not have always agreed with this Government’s economic and development architects. But you will certainly agree with me that you were left to do what you wanted to do, what you needed to do, with least interference and maximum consultation from Government.
</p><p>
</p><p>As I prepare to pass the reins of responsibility to my duly elected and proclaimed successor, let me take stock and put together a perspective of what we tried to accomplish in the economy these past six years.
</p><p>
</p> A key focus had to be on restructuring the economy. We had to get out of cronyism, as practised by the Marcoses and those closest to them. For clearly, this led to the abuse of government power for private gain. The structures cronyism built propped up the pursuit of personal wealth through misuse and abuse of public authority. We had to replace these with those that ensured market discipline. We had to put an end to their divine right of plunder.
<p>
</p><p>a) We had to ensure the independence and autonomy of the government financial institutions. The Philippine National Bank and the Development Bank of the Philippines had to be rehabilitated.
</p><p>
</p><p>b) We had to remove controls from the productive sectors of the economy. Monopolies that had such a stranglehold on agriculture had to be quickly dismantled.
</p><p>
</p><p>c) We had to pursue privatization so that productive assets could be more efficiency used under private sector ownership, management and control.
</p><p>
</p><p>d) We liberalized trade and investments so that productivity is enhanced through more open competition. We removed Quantitative Restrictions or QRs, lifted price controls, lowered protectionist tariffs. We initiated the liberalization of the foreign exchange market.
</p><p>
</p><p>We had to begin to restructure an economy reeling from the most devastating post-war recession ever. And we did put the economy back on the growth track in 1986. We continue to sustain this, despite a global economic slowdown two years ago and the major disasters that have recently struck. Figures support this. The seal of good economic housekeeping from international agencies is a boost to this. The general feeling confirms this.
</p><p>
</p><p>And then, we had to begin the trek to stability for growth and development.
</p><p>
</p><p>Before we completely leave economic restructuring, let me tell you now my Joke No. 2 on the subject of cronyism. One of the most amusing stories which have been circulating these past six years is that about my Mahjong Cronies, Bea Zobel and Betty Belmonte. At exactly five o’clock everyday, I’m supposed to stop working and begin playing mahjong. The story became so rife that Sister Christine Tan, observing that I was staying late at the Guest House, after a meeting with her, told me that perhaps I should relax and play mahjong with Bea and Betty. “Well, Sister,” I told her then, “Taking a break with those two very good women is fine. But neither of them knows how to play mahjong, so they cannot be my mahjong cronies.” End of Joke.

She justified her presence in front of the U.S. Congress using symbolicwords and figurativelanguage, alluding to her connection with the late Ninoy on one hand and satisfyingher commandto the Filipino people on the other.

                        <p><strong>AQUINO’S SPEECH BEFORE THE JOINT SESSION OF THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS</strong></p><p></p><p>On September 18, 1986, almost seven months after <strong>she became the eleventh President of the Philippine Republic</strong>, Maria Corazon “Cory” Cojuango Aquino delivered a speech before the joint session of the United States Congress in Washington DC.</p><p>Cory was the widow of the late Benigno “Ninoy” Aquino, Jr., the youngest Governor to be elected in the Philippines and the youngest member of the Philippine Senate during that time. </p><p>With his death brought by his opposition to the political views of then-dictator President Ferdinand E. Marcos, Cory continued his legacy and campaigned against the violence experienced by the Filipinos and their homelessness in their own country. </p><p>Encouraged by the revolution to run as President to challenge Marcos and keep on advocating the beliefs and principles his husband had started, Cory became the first Filipina to be sworn in the highest position of the Philippine government. </p><p>In her speech before the US Congress, Cory shared her experiences and sorrow for losing a loving husband and a good father to her family. She provided a brief narration of how Marcos suspended the Philippine Constitution and shut down the Congress, which eventually led to Ninoy’s exile and death, highlighting the cruelty he experienced at the hands of the military and the dictator. </p><p>From this, she detailed how the task to free the Filipinos and fight for democracy fell into her shoulders. She mentioned how she personally experienced the corruption of the Commission on Elections and praised the unity and courage of the people in times of oppression. </p><p>As the new President of the country, she went over some of her plans to restore the government first by reinstituting and amending the Philippine Constitution, as well as to start reintegration programs for the healing of the different localities in the country. </p><p>She also acknowledged the 26 billion-dollar debt acquired by the Marcos regime, managed to create negotiations to be able to gradually pay for it on behalf of the previous administration, and lodged an appeal from the foreigners for further assistance. </p><p>As her speech neared its end, she recognized and thanked the efforts of the American people to help achieve the democracy the Filipino people have fought for. Completed with the assistance of Teodoro Lopez Locsin, Jr., Cory Aquino’s speech serves as a primary account of the Martial Law era in the Philippines. </p><p>In this historical disquisition, Cory spoke for all those who were victimized by the Marcos dictatorship, recounting how the death of her husband sparked the first People Power Revolution with Filipinos crying out for democracy and freedom from tyrants of the country. </p><p>The text reflects the social and political situation of the Philippines during that time and accounts for the first peaceful revolution in national history. It carries the grief of the people, which waged the war against the evils of oppression as the Filipino people rally for the cause of freedom. </p><p>Such anguish turned into power which led to the nation’s greatest victory, the abolishment of a dictatorial government, giving way to true liberty, the upliftment of human rights, and the protection of the welfare of the Filipinos. Cory became a symbol of democracy which empowered a politically disenfranchised people. </p><p>I find it extremely exciting the fact that democracy and freedom mattered to the Filipinos more than their socioeconomic situation. The people had strong values and beliefs that they would not let oppressors abuse their rights and privileges as citizens of the country. </p><p>The power of a peaceful protest is also rewarding and motivating, which inspires me to take good care of and give importance to the democracy I am enjoying right now.</p><p> </p><p>Learn more about Cory Aquino's speech at https://brainly.ph/question/4420575</p><p>#SPJ2</p><p></p><br />

Many times, my Cabinet has rolled with the punches; many more times, it has been punch-drunk. Both sides cite statistics. Both present arguments with cold, calculating logic. Some critics have accused my economic and development managers of treason. My managers in turn learned only too quickly, economics for development in this country, is not for the faint of heart. And economic development in this country, thank God and peoplepower, is as robust as robust can be.</p><p></p><p>For you may not have always agreed with this Government’s economic and development architects. But you will certainly agree with me that you were left to do what you wanted to do, what you needed to do, with least interference and maximum consultation from Government.</p><p></p><p>As I prepare to pass the reins of responsibility to my duly elected and proclaimed successor, let me take stock and put together a perspective of what we tried to accomplish in the economy these past six years.</p><p></p><p>1. A key focus had to be on restructuring the economy. We had to get out of cronyism, as practised by the Marcoses and those closest to them. For clearly, this led to the abuse of government power for private gain. The structures cronyism built propped up the pursuit of personal wealth through misuse and abuse of public authority. We had to replace these with those that ensured market discipline. We had to put an end to their divine right of plunder</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><br />
