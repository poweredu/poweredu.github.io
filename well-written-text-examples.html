Write the answer on the space provided.A. Original passage: Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes chronic respiratory disease, and cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVO-19 virus the disease il causes and how it spreads Protect yourself and others from infection by washing your hands or using on alcohol-based rub frequently and not touching your face. The COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose when an infected person coughs or sneezes so it's important that you also practice respiratory etiquette for example by coughing into a flexed elbow).

coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, 
and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-
19 virus, the disease it causes, and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection 
by washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently and not touching your face. 9 WHOThe COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose 
when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it's important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).​</a>

Educational methods include storytelling, discussion, teaching, training, and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, but learners may also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy. Since 1990s STEM is a term used to refer education policies to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. But is much more, because it has implications for workforce development, teaching frameworks, industries, no formal education, etc. Is a term which also involves the equity of a country and some challenges like the gender gap.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>Art education is crucial for the children's development. Many school boards feel that art education is not a necessity and not very important in the lives of today's students. Art classes are constantly compared to the main core classes, such as math and English. Many people feel that core classes are much more valuable to a child's education, which is why art may be cut first from schools if there is low funding. Art classes offer children critical lessons about life that they are not exposed to in any of the other classes. Art teachers drive the creativity and the imagination of students, while allowing students to express themselves.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

coronavirus.Most people infected with the COVID-19 virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. Older people and those with underlying medical problems like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, 
and cancer are more likely to develop serious illnesses.The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the COVID-
19 virus, the disease it causes, and how it spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection 
by washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently and not touching your face. 9 WHOThe COVID-19 virus spreads primarily through droplets of saliva or discharge from the nose 
when an infected person coughs or sneezes, so it's important that you also practice respiratory etiquette (for example, by coughing into a flexed elbow).​</h2><br />
