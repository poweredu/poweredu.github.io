                                            Safe but NewDespite of the emerging issue that this might be a burden for the parents, learning through printedand digital modules is the modality of learning in Pinagkawaitan Integrated National High School. Itsimplementation for the first quarter might have been so tough but it may still be considered better thanhaving nothing at all.Modular distance learning involves individualized instruction that allowslearners to use Self-Learning Modules (SLMs) in print or digital format, whichever is applicable in thecontext of the learner, and other learning resources.For teachers, it will be about how to ensure that the students learn and understand what they areteaching. They will also have to make an extra effort in helping the parents understand the SLM andmaybe, the lesson for the day too. As for the students, it will be the first time for many of them to learnfrom their teacher without being in the same room.Having this modality of learning truly provides a continuing education for the youth. The idea thateducation must not stop in times of any calamity is fulfilled through this modality. The modules beingsent by the school is designed for self-learning and really requires industry and discipline among thestudents.Through this, being self-reliant and hardwork and good study habits are being developed to thelearners. No one can deny that this modality of learning has its drawback. Since, students are not allowedto go out of their homes. They should study the modules and accomplish the modular tasks with theguidance of their parents. However, the development of socialization and interpersonal skills thatnormally accompany traditional learning methods is somehow affected.As 75% of the PINHS learners preferred modular distance learning rather than having an onlinedistance learning modality, the developed learning continuity plan of the school is indeed helpful.New normal educational system-modular learning may challenging but if one will look at itsbrighter side, it would indeed be an answer to avoid academic freeze in times of pandemic. Having anextra effort for all of this really counts for the attaining the objectives and DepEd in continuing theeducation despite of COVID 19.FACTOPINION​</a>

                            4. Safe but NewDespite of the emerging issue that this might be a burden for the parents, learning through printedand digital modules is the modality of learning in Pinagkawaitan Integrated National High School. Itsimplementation for the first quarter might have been so tough but it may still be considered better thanhaving nothing at all.Modular distance learning involves individualized instruction that allowslearners to use Self-Learning Modules (SLMs) in print or digital format, whichever is applicable in thecontext of the learner, and other learning resources.For teachers, it will be about how to ensure that the students learn and understand what they areteaching. They will also have to make an extra effort in helping the parents understand the SLM andmaybe, the lesson for the day too. As for the students, it will be the first time for many of them to learnfrom their teacher without being in the same room.Having this modality of learning truly provides a continuing education for the youth. The idea thateducation must not stop in times of any calamity is fulfilled through this modality. The modules beingsent by the school is designed for self-learning and really requires industry and discipline among thestudents.Through this, being self-reliant and hardwork and good study habits are being developed to thelearners. No one can deny that this modality of learning has its drawback. Since, students are not allowedto go out of their homes. They should study the modules and accomplish the modular tasks with theguidance of their parents. However, the development of socialization and interpersonal skills thatnormally accompany traditional learning methods is somehow affected.As 75% of the PINHS learners preferred modular distance learning rather than having an onlinedistance learning modality, the developed learning continuity plan of the school is indeed helpful.New normal educational system-modular learning may challenging but if one will look at itsbrighter side, it would indeed be an answer to avoid academic freeze in times of pandemic. Having anextra effort for all of this really counts for the attaining the objectives and DepEd in continuing theeducation despite of COVID 19.FACTOPINION​</h2><br />
