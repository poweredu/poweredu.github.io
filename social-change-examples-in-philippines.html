                                            An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</a>

                                            The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</a>

                            5. An Overview of Philippine Literature Historically speaking, Philippine literature can be divided into three most important periods: pre-colonial, colonial, and post-colonial All literary works produced before the Spanish colonization such as chants, proverbs, songs, and folk narratives are considered under pre-colonial period which are mostly of oral traditions. This is not because early Filipinos did not have system of writing yet but due to the unavailability of printing materials. Life was simple and so is literature during this period. If we have phones and other forms of technology to entertain us, our ancestors had literature for recreation who were noted for being music lover as more than 10 types of songs in various Philippine languages were discovered. Our forefathers also valued words of wisdom for teaching values as evidenced by numerous proverbs or salawikain Story telling was used to explain phenomenon and to teach lessons as well. Having bugtong or riddles was also a favorite past time and listening to narratives of bravery, magic, and heroism in epics was a box office hit. The focus of literature suddenly changed upon the arrival of Spaniards. An emphasis on morality and religion was common in literary forms such as Corrido, Pasyon, and Cenaculo. The production of printed materials started but it was mostly of religious purposes and themes. It was made in an attempt to instill traditional Spanish ways and cultures among the native Filipinos. Despite this indoctrination, native tradition still survived and flourished especially for areas where the colonial power was less popular. Literacy paved the way to develop sense of nationalism among Filipinos during the latter part of Spanish colonization. Filipinos started to write about oppression, corruption, and other social ills such as in the works of Dr. Jose P. Rizal entitled Noli Me Tangere and its sequel El Filibusterismo. The literary production during the American Period was inspired by the developments in education and culture. Knowledge and information became accessible to all Filipinos because of the free public education. During the apprenticeship period, the Filipino writers imitated English and American models. All forms of literature were explored by Filipino writers. During this period, short stories were the most prevalent literary form. With the new knowledge of English language, many writers started to gain recognition both locally and internationally like Jose Garcia Villa who earned the International title, "Poet of the Century" as an example. Philippine Literature was interrupted in its development when we were conquered by Japan between 1941-1945 since freedom of expression was uncommon back then. Filipino writers in the Philippines were forbidden to write anything against the government and only those who were in exile had the privilege to do so. As a result of banning the English language, short stories written in the vernaculars flourished in the country. The three most influential foreign invaders to the types of literature produced during colonial periods are Spanish, American, and Japanese wherein the common themes and subject mostly tackle about oppression, religion, freedom, or anything that reflects the experiences of Filipino people under the colonizers. The influences brought to us by colonial periods are said to have been extended up to the postcolonial periods especially in social and cultural dimensions. Post-colonial is the period after the rebirth of freedom in the Philippines up to the present. One of the most unforgotten and controversial periods during this era is having Martial Law during the Marcos regime. All of the periods mentioned are essential towards understanding the types of literature being produced in the Philippines ACTIVITY 1-4 VOCABULARY DEVELOPMENT:difine the meaning of each word based on how it is used in the paragraph1.stock (paragraph 1)2.piousness(paragraph2)3.culminated (paragraph 3)4.interspersed(paragraph 4)5.prominent (paragraph 11) ​</h2><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:By the late 18th century, political and economic changes in Europe were finally beginning to affect Spain and, thus, the Philippines. Important as a stimulus to trade was the gradual elimination of the monopoly enjoyed by the galleon to Acapulco. The last galleon arrived in Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s Manila was open to foreign merchants almost without restriction. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>The growth of commercial agriculture resulted in the appearance of a new class. Alongside the landholdings of the church and the rice estates of the pre-Spanish nobility there arose haciendas of coffee, hemp, and sugar, often the property of enterprising Chinese-Filipino mestizos. Some of the families that gained prominence in the 19th century have continued to play an important role in Philippine economics and politics.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:pa brainliest</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />

                            26. The article's primary focus is on Japan's transition from its most recent industrial revolution to what they refer to as "Society 5.0." Japan's government has envisioned a world in which people and technology coexist and innovate simultaneously. They firmly believe that information and man-made intelligence could be the focal point of driving advancements in each area of their nation of origin. Japan wants to create a future where people live more sustainably, are more inclusive, and are more resilient, and where communities have the skills and resources they need to thrive in a world that is always changing. In the meantime, the Philippines face a number of social and economic threats. The majority of Filipinos and the government of the Philippines live with this reality. As a result, it's important to consider whether this particular model could benefit our own.
The Philippines and Japan share some problems. These are mainly about the population, social exclusion, and economic inequality. The Philippines economy follows a model that heavily relies on labor-intensive sectors and tourism is an example of the main forces that drives the Philippine economy. However, we should know that this may be unsustainable in the long run. Furthermore, it may also restricts the country's potential for inclusive and long-term growth. On the other hand, Japan's success over the past few decades is largely attributable to its well-established and highly advanced technology sector. In contrast, our country consists of a fewer number of manufacturing industries with smaller infrastructure for research and development. In addition, we also have a few number of a skilled workforce. As a result, the country has limited technology and innovation resources and capacity. Thusly, it is impossible that the Philippines can be able to replicate Japan's fruitful reception of innovation through its model in the present without significant investment and drastic changes.
Therefore, although the Philippines is incapable of directly adopting Japan's "Society 5.0" model, I believe that it could still imitate some of the model's aspect and could have benefits out of it especially in the areas of economic development. Through fostering jobs, investing in industries such as IT, manufacturing and healthcare, I believe the country's economy will be developed as it will support innovative start-ups and small businesses of the country. We need to work together and invest in new technologies as this will be one of the main keys in creating new opportunities for our countrymen.</h2><br />
