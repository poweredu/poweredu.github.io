                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The key to any good offensive strategy is passing. The ball can be passed faster and more effectively than it can be dribbled.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Floorball </strong></p><p></p><p>A modern floorball player takes a lot of short spurts in different directions, so they need to be athletic, have <strong>good </strong><strong>reaction</strong><strong> </strong>, <strong>speed </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>elasticity</strong><strong> </strong><strong>skills </strong>, and have good eye hand coordination and stick handling skills.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Rugby </strong></p><p></p><p>Some of the main tactics include using the blindside during a scrum or breakdown, playing in the middle of the field, having the tallest players in specific positions, and making fast plays. One of the main rugby strategies is using <strong>the </strong><strong>zone </strong><strong>system </strong>which involves players knowing their exact place on the field.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Basketball</strong></p><p></p><p>Basically two basic tactics can be distinguished in basketball: <strong>The </strong><strong>"</strong><strong>fast </strong><strong>break" </strong><strong>and </strong><strong>the </strong><strong>play-centered </strong><strong>game.</strong><strong> </strong>In fast break the offense attempt to move the ball forward as quickly as possible so that the defense is out of position and outnumbered. The focus here is on speed and quick passes.</p><br />
