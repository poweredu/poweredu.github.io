                        <p>Our influences in choosing our career path can make or break us.  Therefore, we have to consider some choices before we arrive at a definite decision that we may no longer change throughout our lives.
</p><p></p><p><strong>Here is a list of external factors that influence our career choices and how they affect our choices:
</strong></p><p><strong>1. Life roles
</strong></p><p>We have to think carefully on what life role we would want to play for the next coming years in our lives.
</p><p><strong>2. Parental guidance and opinions
</strong></p><p>We were taught in childhood that parents know what is best for us.  But in the long run, our decisions matter most than any other people’s opinions.  We should have the independence in choosing the career we want to pursue, or else we will be dragging ourselves into doing the things that we never wanted to do.
</p><p><strong>3. Financial capacity
</strong></p><p>Some people are unfortunate to not have enough financial capacity to pursue their dream career.  Since we come up with choices, we may go for what is realistic and reasonable for now.
</p><p><strong>4. Passion or career
</strong></p><p>A lot of people have made their passion their career.  This can be made possible if you want to stick with your passion anyway.  While some others set aside their passion and pursue a career far from the line of their passion.  Either way is okay.

                            5. 1. What are the most important factors that influence the career choices?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When we think about career choice, several things immediately come to mind – job description, training and education required, career outlook, and salary – but there are a number of other factors that may influence your decisions</p>Most important factors that influence the career choices<p></p><p>In <strong>Career</strong> development, there are numerous hypotheses to consider. You'll see that many of the related ideas handle some of the same concerns as you go through the factors below.</p><p>1. CHILDHOOD FANTASIES</p><p>Fantasies from adolescence. When you grow up, what do you want to be? You may recall being asked this question as a child, and it may have influenced how you thought about occupations at the time, as well as later in life. As programs relating to job choice are established for all ages, including the very young, <strong>career</strong> counseling theories are evolving. Ginzberg proposed a hypothesis that divides life into three stages that are linked to job advancement. Up to the age of 14, the first stage, fantasy, occurs, during which early career ideas are established.</p><p></p><p>2. CULTURE</p><p>An individual's racial and cultural heritage, as well as the culture of their regional area, local community, and extended family, can all have an impact on<strong> career</strong> choices. Our beliefs and expectations in many aspects of our lives, including employment and careers, are typically shaped by our culture. When counseling clients and students, multicultural career counseling has arisen as a specialist specialty that takes these factors into account. We can't trace a culture's prominent qualities to any one person, but understanding our culture's beliefs and expectations might help us better understand how we make career decisions.</p><p></p><p>3. GENDER</p><p>Both men and women have been subjected to gender stereotypes in the workplace. Multiple <strong>career</strong> development theories and methodologies, such as Social Learning and multicultural career counseling, consider gender as an issue. When it comes to job decisions, how we see ourselves as individuals can have an impact on both the opportunities and barriers we see. Gender and career development research is ongoing as men and women's responsibilities in the workplace and higher education change.</p><p></p><p>4. ROLES IN LIFE</p><p>Working is simply one of your many responsibilities, which also include being a student, parent, and child. The Lifespan theory of Super explicitly tackles the reality that we all play several roles in our lives, and that these roles vary throughout time. How we think about ourselves in these professions, the demands they place on us, and the external influences that influence them may have an impact on how we view careers in general and how we make professional decisions for ourselves.</p><p></p><p>5. SKILLS, ABILITIES, AND TALENTS</p><p> Trait-Factor theories, one of the earliest <strong>career</strong> development topics, is being used today to consider your skills, abilities, and talents and how they might fit a given occupation. These theories advocate for the creation of occupational profiles for specific employment, as well as the identification of individual characteristics and the matching of people to occupations based on those differences. Through a formal assessment, you can identify activities that you love and those in which you have a level of competency.</p><p></p><p></p><p>How does career exploration help in finding the right career choice​</p><p>brainly.ph/question/19406587</p><p>#LETSSTUDY</p><br />

                            6. What are the personal factors that influence our career choice?​</h2><br />
                        <strong>Answer:</strong><p>"Love your work, and you'll never work a day in your life," we constantly hear this saying. Contrary to popular belief, this is not synonymous with a dysfunctional work-life balance. Rather than that, while determining which professional path is most suited to your abilities, seek out one that you enjoy—one that piques your curiosity and provides a sense of purpose. Matching your future professional goals to your existing skillset may better align your interests and experience. When evaluating your long-term career path, it's prudent to focus on some aspects and practical considerations that will affect your total job happiness. Maintaining a healthy balance between personality and job position is critical for long-term job satisfaction.</p><strong>Factors to consider when choosing career choice:</strong><p><strong>Various roles in life</strong></p>Each individual has a unique job to play in life. He is a homeowner, a father, a husband, or a wife. And each individual considers himself in these various positions and determines which one is most significant to him or her. And this choice may affect the individual's professional path and attitude toward work.<p><strong>Personality and Interests</strong></p>One of the most critical factors to consider is your personality type and the level of enjoyment you seek from your employment—extroverted individuals like engaging with people and finding fulfillment in jobs require a great deal of social interaction while introverted likes to be alone and be in a small group.<p><strong>Lifestyle</strong></p>It is critical to strike a balance between necessities and wants. Additionally, geography should be considered. If you dislike the hustle and bustle, you should avoid city jobs that require a lengthy commute.<p></p><p><strong>For more related information, you may visit this link:</strong></p><p>https://brainly.ph/question/22968252</p>#BrainlyEveryday<br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Career selection is an important stage in a student’s life. It influences a number of decisions that he/she takes based on their career choices. Choice of a subject, a university, an institution, a company, a job profile depends on the career one chooses to pursue.</p><p>Nowadays it is quite certain to find students confused or unaware of their career path, even after having completed their graduation. They seem unsure of the degrees they hold as it doesn’t given them a clear vision of what they want to do.</p><p></p><p>Choosing Right Career is So Important For Students</p><p>Career Planning is no more a one-time occurrence that would end with the decision of the right university or college. It extends until we get the right job and get a satisfying work profile.</p><p>After completion of schooling, one tends to select a stream based on their previous best performance. If a student scores 90 percentile in Science he/she wants to become an engineer/ doctor and likewise they go for commerce and every other subject. In more than 90% of the cases, it turns out to be haste or a wrong decision. The basis on which we evaluate our career choice remains unjustified.</p><p></p><p>Students who face exam anxiety and fail to perform up to their standard in the classroom tests are left out in the race. They are treated as a non-performer or a below-average student. Similarly, there are few who manage to excel just by rote learning. Some depend on their families to make the right call; well, some choose to follow the crowd. There is no clarity of one’s self-interest. This is the first wrong step that can lead them to the wrong path.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>I HOPE IT'S HELP</p><p></p><br />

                            18. how do personal/internal factors influence career choices?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p><p>Main Influencing Factors
</p><p>
</p><p>There so many factors which influence the future career choice and have the effect on different levels. Let’s talk about the most important factors.
</p><p>
</p><p>Different life roles
</p><p>
</p><p>Every person plays different roles in his or her life. He is a worker at work, a parent, husband or wife at home. And every person thinks about himself in these different roles and decides which role will be the most important for him. And this decision may influence the career choice and the way the person looks at his work.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Personality and interests
</p><p>
</p><p>We are all different. We have different tastes, preferences, and tempers. And someone’s success at the particular job position depends on these things. There is a special theory which is called Holland Occupational Themes which can answer how the personality of the work =seeker influence on his choice, his work ambitions and abilities.
</p><p>
</p><p>Previous work experience  
</p><p>
</p><p>If someone has a positive role model in a particular career or positive work experience it will definitely influence the future work choice.  The research has shown that a person prefers to continue the work in which he was more successful rather than start doing something new. In fact, it is a great idea to focus on the work with proven success as well as with positive self-esteem for most of us.
</p><p>
</p><p>Cultural background
</p><p>
</p><p>The cultural background of the person as well as his regional area and ethnic group can influence the future work choice. Besides family of the job seeker and local community also can become the factors which can determine someone’s future career. Person’s expectations and life values are always shaped according to the cultural issues, and they have connections with different parts of our lives. Understanding of the nature of our expectations and values can help us to understand our personality and make a right career choice.  
</p><p>
</p><p>Economic and social conditions of life
</p><p>
</p><p>Our life benchmarks and career choices always lie in the context of the economic and social issues. And it is natural. Sometimes we can’t choose the society in which we have to live, but we can choose the way of life. Different situations and conditions which take place in our economic and social lives give us a definite choice and have a certain effect on it. And we have to take into account this factor.
</p><p>
</p><p>The financial aspect
</p><p>
</p><p>For many of us, money which we can earn is the most important factor which influences on the future career choice. This is not surprising. We have to pay for everything that we have in our lives. But everyone has different needs and ways of life that’s why think twice when considering the job which will not allow living as you like and make a correct and reasonable choice.
</p><p>
</p><p>Find Your Best Career
</p><p>
</p><p>Along with pragmatic factors, there are issues which can influence someone’s future work choice. And they lie in the non-material plane. It’s important to choose the career which will bring pleasure. Find your career passion and the work will always be a joy. You have to choose something passionately for you. Find out what can inspire you and follow your inspiration. Answer the simple question “do you really want this career?”. If you are confused with your choice, just take some break and clarify your thoughts.
</p><p>
</p><p>You can make your hobby your work
</p><p>
</p><p>You have to make a decision what purposes do you have right now. And what do you want to get from your work? What are the reasons in favor of some particular career? Do you want to earn money or you want to develop your talents? It’s great if you have an opportunity to choose the career which is related to your hobby or interests.
</p><p>
</p><p>For short, the answers is:
</p><p>
</p><p>Main Influencing Factors.
</p><p>
</p><p>Different life roles.
</p><p>
</p><p>Personality and interests.
</p><p>
</p><p>Previous work experience.  </p><p>
</p><p>Cultural background.
</p><p>
</p><p>Economic and social conditions of life.

                        <strong>Answer:</strong>Successful Career Planning<p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>WHAT IS A CAREER?<p></p><p>A career can be defined as a person's progress within an occupation or series of occupations. However, a career is more than just a job, or working, or your occupation. It also includes your progress through life, your growth and development in vocational and avocational areas of life.</p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p>Many of us think that there is only one occupation that is best suited for us, but there are really several that may be good choices. The secret is to identify those occupations in which you have a high probability for success and happiness. As a college student, whether your career goals are accounting, theatre arts, or environmental sciences, there are general skills which will be required regardless of the career you pursue. These skills include the ability to read, write, compute, think critically, and communicate in an effective manner. For the most part, these skills are developed and/or sharpened in general education courses. These skills, along with effective career planning techniques, and the ability to cope with ambiguity in a changing environment, will enable you to overcome obstacles throughout your work life.<p></p><p>I'm sorry if my answer is to long☺️</p><br />
