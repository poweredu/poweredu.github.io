                        <p><strong>Answer Hi!</strong></p><p>The Philippines has five types of climates: tropical rainforest, tropical monsoon, tropical savanna, humid subtropical and oceanic (both are in higher-altitude areas) characterized by relatively high temperature, oppressive humidity and plenty of rainfall. There are two seasons in the country, the wet season and the dry season, based upon the amount of rainfall.[1] This is also dependent on location in the country as some areas experience rain all throughout the year (see Climate types). Based on temperature, the warmest months of the year are March through October; the winter monsoon brings cooler air from November to February. May is the warmest month, and January, the coolest.[2]</p><p></p><p>Weather in the Philippines is monitored and managed by the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA).</p><p></p><p>[tex]Rainfall![/tex]</p><p>Monsoons are large-scale sea breezes which occur when the temperature on land is significantly warmer or cooler than the temperature of the ocean. Most summer monsoons or southwest monsoons (Filipino: Habagat) have a dominant westerly component and a strong tendency to ascend and produce copious amounts of rain (because of the condensation of water vapor in the rising air). The intensity and duration, however, are not uniform from year to year. Winter monsoons or northeast monsoons (Filipino: Amihan), by contrast, have a dominant easterly component and a strong tendency to diverge, subside and cause drought.</p><p></p><p>The summer monsoon brings heavy rains to most of the archipelago from May to October. Annual average rainfall ranges from as much as 5,000 millimeters (197 in) in the mountainous east coast section of the country, to less than 1,000 millimeters (39 in) in some of the sheltered valleys. Monsoon rains, although hard and drenching, are not normally associated with high winds and waves.</p><p></p><p>At least 30 percent of the annual rainfall in the northern Philippines can be traced to tropical cyclones, while the southern islands receiving less than 10 percent of their annual rainfall from tropical cyclones. The wettest known tropical cyclone to impact the archipelago was the July 1911 cyclone, when the total precipitation for Baguio was distributed over the four days as: 14th – 879.8 mm (34.6 in), 15th – 733.6 mm (28.9 in), 16th – 424.9 mm (16.7 in), 17th – 200.4 mm (7.9 in);[3][4] followed by extraordinary drought from October 1911 to May 1912, so that the annual amount of those two years were hardly noticeable.</p><p></p><p>[tex]Tyboons[/tex]</p><p>Main article: Typhoons in the Philippines</p><p>PAGASA's Tropical Cyclone Intensity Scale[5][6]</p><p>Category	Sustained winds</p><p>Super typhoon (STY)	≥185 km/h!</p><p>≥100 knots</p><p>Typhoon (TY)	118–184 km/h!</p><p>64–99 knots</p><p>Severe tropical storm (STS)	89–117 km/h!</p><p>48–63 knots</p><p>Tropical storm (TS)	62–88 km/h!</p><p>34–47 knots</p><p>Tropical depression (TD)	≤61 km/h!</p><p>≤33 knots!</p><p>The Philippines sit across the typhoon belt, making dangerous storms from July through October. Climate change exacerbates the situation with typhoons in the Philippines.[7] Bagyo is the Filipino term for any tropical cyclone in the Philippine Islands.[4] From the statistics gathered by PAGASA from 1948 to 2004, around an average of 28 storms and/or typhoons per year enter the PAR (Philippine Area of Responsibility) – the designated area assigned to pagasa to monitor during weather disturbances. Those that made landfall or crossed the Philippines, the average was nine per year. In 1993, a record 19 typhoons made landfall in the country making it the most in one year. The fewest per year were 4 during the years 1955, 1958, 1992, and 1997.[8]</p><p></p><p>pagasa categorises typhoons into five types according to wind speed. Once a tropical cyclone enters the PAR, regardless of strength, it is given a local name for identification purposes by the media, government, and the general public.[9]</p><br />

In areas of heavy rainfall, the houses have sloping roofs. The material used in construction is, however, determined by the availability of construction material. The roof could be tiled or comprise bamboos covered with hay where clay for making tiles may not be available.</p><p></p><p>In dry regions like Rajasthan, flat stone pieces are used for roofing. Partition walls are made of wood in very cold countries. In regions of high temperature, there are open courtyards attached to each dwelling. In hill districts houses are made on stilts with the ground floor reserved for cattle.</p><p></p><p>Dress:</p><p></p><p>Loose dresses are popular in regions where the climate is hot. In colder regions, people wear dresses that are body hugging. A very wide variety of head gears is used again depending on the climate. The Sola hat was so popular with the British people living in the hot plains of India .Where rainfall is abundant people wear head gears that provide protection against rain while people are at work.</p><p></p><p>The lungi is popular in the southern regions of the country where it is relatively hot but not so in colder region as Himachal Pradesh. Woollens are worn in cold regions while cotton clothing is worn in hot and temperate regions. Synthetic clothing may be suitable in cold climates but not so at places where people perspire during the day.</p><p></p><p>Occupations:</p><p></p><p>During the winter months when outdoor living is not easy, the people of Kashmir remain indoors and follow up occupations like making carpets, handicrafts; silk wares that can be weaved sitting indoors. Agriculture is practiced where rainfall is adequate.</p><p></p><p>People living in dry regions follow pastoral occupations moving from place to place along with their herds of cattle looking for water and grass where ever it may be available. Where rainfall is abundant, forestry comes up as an important occupation for the people.</p><p></p><p>Art and Culture:</p><p></p><p>Open air stage performances are popular in areas that are not very cold. A wide variety exists at places where people have opportunity to remain out doors for most part of the year.</p><p></p><p>Food habits:</p><p></p><p>Since climate determines the nature of crops that can be grown in any part, the food habit also get influence by the climate. In Bengal, the staple food is rice since heavy rainfall in that region is most suited for paddy cultivation. The northern parts of the country, wheat are the staple diet. Millets are popular in dry regions like Rajasthan.</p><p></p><p>Crops like Bajra are grown there since this crop can survive even with scant water supply. The people living in Tundra region have no chance of being vegetarians. The climate does not allow growing any cereals or food crops.</p><p></p><p>Migration:</p><p></p><p>People living in extremely cold climates are known to migrate to warmer places in search of jobs.

                        <p></p><p></p><p>The climate in the Philippines is generally tropical, characterized by high temperature and humidity throughout the year. The country experiences two main seasons: the dry season, which runs from November to April, and the wet season, which runs from May to October. During the dry season, the weather is generally hot and dry, with little to no rainfall. On the other hand, the wet season is characterized by frequent rainfall, often in the form of heavy downpours and thunderstorms.</p><p></p><p>The climate in the Philippines is affected by several factors, including its location in the tropics, the prevailing winds, and the mountainous terrain. The country is also prone to typhoons, which can cause heavy rain and strong winds, particularly during the wet season.</p><p></p><p>There are four main types of climate in the Philippines: Type I, Type II, Type III, and Type IV. Type I climate is characterized by two pronounced seasons: a dry season from November to April and a wet season from May to October. Type II climate is characterized by no dry season, with heavy rainfall occurring throughout the year. Type III climate is characterized by a more or less evenly distributed rainfall throughout the year, with no distinct dry or wet season. Type IV climate is characterized by rainfall that is more or less evenly distributed throughout the year, but with a short dry season.</p><p></p><p>The different regions of the Philippines are affected differently by the climate and seasons. For example, the Bicol region, which includes Catanduanes, Sorsogon, and Camarines Norte, is known for its heavy rainfall and frequent typhoons. The Cordillera Administrative Region, which includes Benguet and Ifugao, has a cooler climate due to its high elevation. The Visayas region, which includes Cebu and Bohol, experiences a more or less even distribution of rainfall throughout the year.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, understanding the climate and seasons in the Philippines is important in many aspects of everyday life, from agriculture to disaster preparedness.</p><br />

                        1. The Rainy (Wet) Season and the Summer (hot and dry) season 2. All countries have certain seasons. We have these seasons because we are in the southern hemisphere. The Northern ones have winter and fall.Climate of the Philippines is either tropical rainforest, tropical savanna tropical monsoon, or humid subtropical (in higher-altitude areas) characterized by relatively high temperature, oppressive humidity and plenty of rainfall. There are two seasons in the country, the wet season and the dry season, based upon the amount of rainfall.[1] This is dependent as well on your location in the country as some areas experience rain all throughout the year (see Climate Types). Based on temperature, the seven warmest months of the year are from March to October; the winter monsoon brings cooler air from November to February. May is the warmest month, and January, the coolest.<br /><br />
