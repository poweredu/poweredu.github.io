</strong></p><p>
</p><p><strong>The second law of motion is also known as the Law of acceleration:
</strong></p><p>Force causes the object to accelerate. The formula for Force is ( Force = mass × acceleration ). This means that the Force and acceleration when mass is constant is directly proportional. The stronger the force the higher the acceleration. When force is constant, acceleration and mass are inversely proportional. The higher the mass the lesser the acceleration and vise versa.
