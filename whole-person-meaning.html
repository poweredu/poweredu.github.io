Yes, it is important to understand that you should always be able to spread love around yourself.</p><p>Do not get so succumbed to the materialistic pleasures of life that you forget its real meaning. Always try to spread love among people around you. Make sure that you love others, and make them feel happy.</p><p>Be it a stranger, or even your known acquaintances, always speak to them with a kind heart and a polite attitude and that will make both of you feel happy and loved.
