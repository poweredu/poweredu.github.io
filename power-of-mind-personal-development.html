Direction: Choose the best word inside the parenthesis ( ) to complete the concept of the following statement about 
developing a plan to enhance brain functions. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 
1. Mind (ability, power) is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess. 
2. Your mind mapping ability (declines, enhances) your brain functions. 
3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body and the (left, right) brain controls the left 
side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.
4. Everybody is expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is a need to enhance brain 
(development, functions). 
5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape 
your schedule and coursework, to suit your own (mind, personality) type. 
6. Remember that Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your brain. Mind 
mapping is a creative and logical means of (handwriting, note taking) that literally "maps out" your ideas. 
7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony (Buzan, Biazon).
8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will (guide, include) you in keeping you mind map connected 
to each other. 
9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mind map (easy, hard). They are the use of 
colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size. 
10. Getting information such as the brain (facts, parts) and enhancing our brain functions leads to a maximum 
‘Powers of the Mind’.

                                            Keep in Mind Suggested Time Allotment: 15 minutes      Challenges are meant to motivate you and see what you are capable of doing. What's more, when you try to look back on those tough times, you can be truly proud of how you have overcome them using the most powerful weapon that you have your gained knowledge and skills. Your experiences at home, school and community, both positive and negative, give you important lessons that can help and guide you in dealing with future challenges.       The following are ways on how you can use and apply your academic and life lessons to deal future challenges:       3 Rs of Overcoming Life's Challenges through Gained Knowledge 1. Reflect. Reflection gives your mind an opportunity to pause and sort through your thoughts and feelings. This is also the time to wonder about your past experiences at home, school or community. For instance, you may reflect on the steps in problem solving and decision-making that you have learned from school or remember the pieces of advice that your parents and teachers gave you when you encountered a similar situation.2. Respond. Responding means acting on a situation while taking into consideration not only on what is good for you but for others as well. To effectively respond with challenges you need to plan your actions carefully. Weigh the possible effects of your decisions and reflect on your core values. Enjoy the process and develop a growth mindset to help you succeed and overcome challenges. As you go along, you will continuously learn, unlearn and re-learn which will empower you to apply your gained knowledge from one experience to another.3. Review. Reviewing helps in remembering the important information and key details of what you have learned. Learning is built on prior knowledge that's why in school, review is a very important part of the teaching and learning process. When done well, this gives you the opportunity to take what you have learned, make it your own, and apply it. More so, in your daily life, you can simply review and apply the knowledge and lessons that you have learned to any academic or personal challenges.​</a>

                                            Every individual undergoes the process of (1) during his/her life time. This refers to the lifelong process of social interaction thorugh which people acquire their identities and all necessary skills for survival in society. Socialization is a necessary social process for it is through this that (2) is taking place. However, as the field of sociology developed over time, socialization was increasingly viewed in the context of (3) . This refers to the process of accepting the social norms, attitudes, roles and values transmitted by people and social groups. (4) view society, for its part, is seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learn to think and behave. On the other hand, (5) sees socialization as an interactive process between individuals and other members of society. This view gives importance to the independence of the individuals and their capacity to define their own personal views and ideas. While, Anthropologist view socialization in terms of becoming familiar with one's own culture and use the term (6) to describe the process of being socialized into one own's culture. It was found out that people who lacked socialization developed mental and physical disabilities.On the other hand, people with successful socialization experiences become (7) in different aspects of life. It is important to remember that (8) are influential in shaping one’s personality. There are several factors that plays an important part of the socialization process. These are: family, peer group, school, church, community, social media and the government. Among these, (9) contributes the most impact on one’s personal development because the crucial and intense socialization happens with it. Becoming part of a particular (10) is a product of socialization. And so, don’t forget to bear in mind that we need to choose the kind of activities we involve ourselves into. For whenever we (11) ,we develop the kind of (12) we have. For an individual to continue functioning as a member of the group, he or she should (13) to the general behaviors and attitudes prevalent within it. It is the act of submitting oneself to the norms and conventions of society. Herbert Kelman identifies three types of conformity: compliance, identification and internalization. (14) refers to the outward conformity to social pressure but privately disagreeing with it. On the other hand, deviance is the opposite of conformity. Deviants are those who do not conform with the norms and laws of society. There are different sociological theories that explains deviance. These are Structuralist theory, Labeling theory, Conflict theory, Structuralist-Functionalists theory, Control theory, Symbolic-interactionist, Subculture view and the Broken glass window theory. The (15) theory analyzes deviance in the framework of competing interests between social groups and the maintenance of power among the elites. While, (16) considers deviance as a socially constructed phenomenom influenced largely by interpersonal relationships between members of society. (17) consider crime and deviance as the result of structural tension and lack of moral regulation within the society. However, there are ways to prevent deviance. We have (18) which is a systematic means and practices used to maintain norms, rules and laws, regulate conflict and discourage deviant behavior. (19) are those provided by laws and other regulations in society, while (20) consists of actions such as ostracism and humiliation.CHOICES: Personality Family Normal Socialization Culture Enculturation Socialize Peers Agents of socialization School Personal development Society Functionalists Acculturation Compliance Interpretevists  Results Internalization Deviant Symbolic-interactionist School Conform Conflict Structuralist-Functionalists  Informal Sanctions Formal Sanctions Sanctions Social control</a>

                                            Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</a>

Direction: Choose the best word inside the parenthesis ( ) to complete the concept of the following statement about 
developing a plan to enhance brain functions. Write your answer on a separate sheet of paper. 
1. Mind (ability, power) is one of the strongest and most useful powers you possess. 
2. Your mind mapping ability (declines, enhances) your brain functions. 
3. Left brain controls all the muscles on the right-hand side of the body and the (left, right) brain controls the left 
side. One hemisphere may be slightly dominant, as with left- or right-handedness.
4. Everybody is expected for a better and smarter brain, the reason why there is a need to enhance brain 
(development, functions). 
5. Always understand your dominant brain type, you may be able to adjust your study methods, and perhaps shape 
your schedule and coursework, to suit your own (mind, personality) type. 
6. Remember that Mind mapping is a highly effective way of getting information in and out of your brain. Mind 
mapping is a creative and logical means of (handwriting, note taking) that literally "maps out" your ideas. 
7. New Mind Maps examples were popularized by author and consultant, Tony (Buzan, Biazon).
8. Improving and following the steps in mind mapping will (guide, include) you in keeping you mind map connected 
to each other. 
9. Need to apply more recommendations in mind mapping to make the mind map (easy, hard). They are the use of 
colors, drawings, and symbols, keeping the topic label, as much as possible, short, and vary text size. 
10. Getting information such as the brain (facts, parts) and enhancing our brain functions leads to a maximum 
‘Powers of the Mind’.

This refers to the lifelong process of social interaction thorugh which people acquire their identities and all necessary skills for survival in society. Socialization is a necessary social process for it is through this that (2) is taking place. However, as the field of sociology developed over time, socialization was increasingly viewed in the context of (3) . This refers to the process of accepting the social norms, attitudes, roles and values transmitted by people and social groups. (4) view society, for its part, is seen as the primary factor responsible for how individuals learn to think and behave. On the other hand, (5) sees socialization as an interactive process between individuals and other members of society. This view gives importance to the independence of the individuals and their capacity to define their own personal views and ideas. While, Anthropologist view socialization in terms of becoming familiar with one's own culture and use the term (6) to describe the process of being socialized into one own's culture. It was found out that people who lacked socialization developed mental and physical disabilities.On the other hand, people with successful socialization experiences become (7) in different aspects of life. It is important to remember that (8) are influential in shaping one’s personality. There are several factors that plays an important part of the socialization process. These are: family, peer group, school, church, community, social media and the government. Among these, (9) contributes the most impact on one’s personal development because the crucial and intense socialization happens with it. Becoming part of a particular (10) is a product of socialization. And so, don’t forget to bear in mind that we need to choose the kind of activities we involve ourselves into.

For an individual to continue functioning as a member of the group, he or she should (13) to the general behaviors and attitudes prevalent within it. It is the act of submitting oneself to the norms and conventions of society. Herbert Kelman identifies three types of conformity: compliance, identification and internalization. (14) refers to the outward conformity to social pressure but privately disagreeing with it. On the other hand, deviance is the opposite of conformity. Deviants are those who do not conform with the norms and laws of society. There are different sociological theories that explains deviance. These are Structuralist theory, Labeling theory, Conflict theory, Structuralist-Functionalists theory, Control theory, Symbolic-interactionist, Subculture view and the Broken glass window theory. The (15) theory analyzes deviance in the framework of competing interests between social groups and the maintenance of power among the elites. While, (16) considers deviance as a socially constructed phenomenom influenced largely by interpersonal relationships between members of society. (17) consider crime and deviance as the result of structural tension and lack of moral regulation within the society. However, there are ways to prevent deviance. We have (18) which is a systematic means and practices used to maintain norms, rules and laws, regulate conflict and discourage deviant behavior.

                            15. Despite a less than ideal childhood, Anelisa marched against the grain and surprised his family when he was accepted into university. "Throughout my schooling, I stayed with my uncle and basically brought myself up as he is a taxi driver and works irregular hours and I received very little support from my family who live in the Eastern Cape," recounts Anelisa. Reflecting on the significance of 16 June in our country's history, Anelisa advises the country's youth to remember that our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate but that we are powerful beyond measure. "It's not our darkness but our light that most frightens us and as we let each one of our light's shine, we are unconsciously giving others the opportunity to do And his biggest concern about the world today? "A lack of humility! It seems many people work for financial gain only, rather than helping or contributing towards making the world a better place." Anelisa however believes that the world is full of opportunities. "With a great plan and enough ambition, we can all achieve all our goals." After fulfilling his dream of attending university, Anelisa graduated and was accepted on to Engen's prestigious graduate development programme. The Engen Graduate Development Programme sees graduates spend time across a broad range of business functions. To date Anelisa has worked in Engen's Fixed Asset Team and in the Tax Department as a graduate trainee. "I never imagined myself working for one of the petroleum industry leaders! "It was an exciting opportunity for me to join Engen and see how I can contribute to making the value chain more effective and efficient, so that ultimately real value is added to the end customer." As a graduate trainee at Engen, he is discovering where he best fits in within the company. "I really appreciate the company's culture and beliefs - they put their money into growing people skills, while the leadership style adopted by top management is indicative of how the company puts its employees first and creates a space for everyone to learn and grow as individuals." So, what is Anelisa's greatest ambition? "I really want to touch people's lives. I don't want to say change people's lives because I feel like it's up to each individual to change their own lives, but what I can do, is assist them in the process of changing their lives." Continuing to attract and grow talented young minds like Analisa Gazi, demonstrates Engen's ongoing commitment to developing our countries future experts and isaders. In 2020, the company invested R9.8 million in Learnerships and Bursaries. They also continue to provide supplementary Maths, Science and Technology tuition to approximately 1 800 under-privileged Grade 10 12 learners across South Africa through the Engen Maths and Science School programme.Questions1.2 Identify and explain TWO types of goals in line with Anelisa's story 1.3 Discuss any THREE challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles1.4 Analyse how Anelisa personal values contributed to his success1.5 Critically discuss how relationships can impact negatively on the achivements of goals ​</h2><br />

This goal reflects his desire to make a positive impact on others and to contribute to making the world a better place.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1.3 Three challenges Anelisa experienced that could've been obstacles are:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>a) Childhood: Anelisa had a less than ideal childhood and had to bring himself up. This could have impacted his self-esteem and motivation.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>b) Lack of family support: Anelisa received very little support from his family who lived in the Eastern Cape.
