                            1. What are the types of carry in first aid?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p> There are several types of carry that can be used depending on the situation and the condition of the person. Here are some of them:</p><p></p><strong>Pack-strap carry</strong> - This is a carry used when the person is conscious and able to sit. The rescuer should stand behind the person, wrap their arms around the person's chest, interlock their hands, and then pull the person up to a standing position.<strong>Two-person seat carry </strong>- This is a carry used when the person is conscious and can sit but needs assistance. Two rescuers stand on either side of the person, facing each other. They each place one hand under the person's knees and the other hand under their arms. They then lift the person up to a sitting position.<strong>Clothes drag carry</strong> - This is a carry used when the person is unconscious and cannot sit. The rescuer should kneel behind the person, grasp the person's clothing at the shoulders, and then drag the person to safety.<strong>Fireman's carry</strong> - This is a carry used when the person is unconscious and needs to be moved quickly. The rescuer should kneel beside the person, roll them toward themselves, and then lift the person onto their shoulders with their head and arms supported.<strong>Blanket drag carry</strong> - This is a carry used when the person is conscious or unconscious and needs to be moved on a flat surface. The rescuer should place a blanket or sheet under the person, grab the corners, and then drag the person to safety.<p></p><br />
