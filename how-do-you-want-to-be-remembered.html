                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>My writing experience was not bad at all because I  still managed to have good knowledge about  writing. I still remember when we are given only 10 minutes to write an essay/paragraph that consist 200 words. What I did is that I avoid using apostrophe on  my words and I write things again and again in a way that my teacher wouldn't really notice because of the amount of time she had given. I wanted to learn more about writing, to enhance my knowledge about writing because to be honest I have already forgotten some of the lessons we had when I was in highschool. So I'm hoping to learn more and to have more knowledge about writing.</p><p>PS: I'm only Highschool!</p><br />
