This refers to fraudulent acts that entail claiming another person's ideas, work or publication violating intellectual property rights by stealing and dishonesty. This usually happens in scientific publications. 14. It involves producing data without an actual experimentation or altering data in recording with the intent to fit them to desired results. 15. Entails faulty gathering of data due to negligence and carelessness which lead to errors in measurement or instrument use. Error may also be caused by inappropriate application of treatment to the subjects and poor data recording 16. It involves producing data without an actual experimentation or altering data in recording with the intent to fit them to desired results. 17. In contrast with fabrication and falsification, this involves choosing not to include data because they do not conform to the well-established body of knowledge or are unsupportive of the research hypothesis. Only the results that do not reject the hypothesis are reported and published. 18. Interest in a subject drive you to research, investigate, or inquire about it with full motivation, enthusiasm, and energy. 19. Information will serve as evidence to support your claims about your subject matter from varied forms of literature like books, journals, and newspapers, among others, is a part and parcel of any research work. 20.

This refers to fraudulent acts that entail claiming another person's ideas, work or publication violating intellectual property rights by stealing and dishonesty. This usually happens in scientific publications. 14. It involves producing data without an actual experimentation or altering data in recording with the intent to fit them to desired results. 15. Entails faulty gathering of data due to negligence and carelessness which lead to errors in measurement or instrument use. Error may also be caused by inappropriate application of treatment to the subjects and poor data recording 16. It involves producing data without an actual experimentation or altering data in recording with the intent to fit them to desired results. 17. In contrast with fabrication and falsification, this involves choosing not to include data because they do not conform to the well-established body of knowledge or are unsupportive of the research hypothesis. Only the results that do not reject the hypothesis are reported and published. 18. Interest in a subject drive you to research, investigate, or inquire about it with full motivation, enthusiasm, and energy. 19.
