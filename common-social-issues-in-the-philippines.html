(STRUCTURALISM, MORAL CRITICISM, MARXISM, FEMINISM, HISTORICAL APPROACH, READER-RESPONSE APPROACH)____________________1. The bible teaches us the value of forgiveness through the parable of The Prodigal Son, wherein the son asked for his inheritance from his father and left. He wasted all his inheritance and came back to his father empty-handed. He expected that he would have to beg for his father to take him back despite what he did. To his surprise, he was warmly welcomed by his father without hesitation. He was forgiven despite all his mistakes.____________________2. In the story of Cinderella, the Prince came from a rich family of royalties while Cinderella is just a poor commoner. Cinderella’s stepmother believes that she is not fit for the Prince because they live in two separate worlds of the rich and the poor.____________________3. The novel, Animal Farm, written by George Orwell was published in 1945. This novel is an allegory - even though it is set on a farm and stars a cast of farm animals, it reflects the events of the Russian revolution of 1917. The animals are all clever representations of Russian politicians, voters and workers. Orwell used the novel to make his opinions on Russian leaders. He couldn’t blatantly attack these leaders in his writings because of the censorship that British Media imposed during the 1940s just to get support from Soviet Union, so he allegorically criticized them using The Animal Farm. During the censorship, anti-Stalin and anti-Soviet writings were put on hold and were never published in Great Britain.____________________4. On June 17, 2018, workers at NurtiAsia Philippines went on a strike against low wages and unhealthy working conditions. The workers also alleged that NutriAsia practiced contractualization -- extending regular employment agreements to less than 10 percent of its 1,400-person workforce. The protest resulted in violent dispersal of the workers and on July 5 of the same year, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ordered NutriAsia to regularize 80 contractual workers.____________________5. The Autobiography of Veronica Franco, an Italian poet and a courtesan (sex worker in Renaissance Italy) talks about her struggles as a woman to gain a spot in the world of literature dominated mostly by men of nobility. She was labeled as an ‘honest courtesan’ for she fully disclosed in her autobiography her sexual relationships with intellectuals, noble men, and even with Kings. She used her social status as a courtesan to establish a name in literature because at that time, women did not have much voice in the society. What Veronica did was discuss and expose sexual issues, and for that, she was attacked by some of her male acquaintances for her boldness because men expected women to be reserved during that era.​</a>

                                            Read the following excepts and tell if the information provided shows cause and effect, classification, comparison, definition, or description. ___1. There are four types of transportation available in the metro. A tricycle is a motorcycle with an attached side car. It is used to transport people within villages or to nearby locations. Next, a jeepney is a homegrown transportation that can fit 16 to 22 people at a time. Its body components are usually made of stainless steel with fanciful decors. Inside, passengers will have to sit in a long cushioned bench on each side of the cab. A rather common type is the bus. Buses can fit in a maximum of 60 people at a time, and may follow a city or provincial route. Lastly is the train. Currently. there are four active train lines in Manila: the L RTA lines 1 and 2, the MRT3, and the PNR. Each train line has a specific route and it is the fastest way to get around the city.___2.If I have a choice, I would rather live by the sea than on a mountain. It's nice to wake up to the sound of the lapping waves and the smell of the fresh sea breeze. Unlike in the mountain where there's nothing much to see but trees, trees, and only trees. By the shore, you can do many things. You may dip your feet onto the cold sea water, play with sand, go boating, observe shells the choices are endless! I doubt if you can do as many things on a mountain. I can't think of any activity that I can do if ever I would live on a mountain, that's why I would rather live by the sea.1___3. Camiguin is an island off the coast of Mindanao. It is an island that formed out of one or several volcanic eruptions, thus it's called the island born of fire Despite it being the second smallest province in - the Philippines, it has so many things to offer. It has a beautiful sandbar, called White Island, which is not exactly an island but a landmass made of powdery white sand. The place is ideal for swimming as it is surrounded by clear water and two volcanoes. Another sight to behold in Camiguin is its rich coral and sea life, which may be seen when you go snorkeling in Mantigue Island. It is an islet that also has powdery white sand and blue crystal clear water. Camiguin Island itself boasts of other water forms such as falls, hot, and cold springs. Katibawasan Falls is a 250-feet high falls that cascades onto a rock pool surrounded by orchids, ferns, and boulders. Its cold water is suitable for anyone in need of being revitalized from the hot summer days. Truly, if you are in need of a refreshing summer, head off to Camiguin and witness the beauty nature has to offer.___4. The term slacktivist is a blending of two words: slacker and activist. A slacktivist is a person that performs activism online, through social media. A slacktivist's posts are usually about his or her personal advocacies, or criticism of certain personalities, issues, events, or of the government in general. It is a convenient way of voicing protest as it is only done in the comforts of one's home or favorite nook.___5. Reading is an activity that many people do not appreciate. There are so many benefits to reading. For one, reading allows you to travel to different places, time periods, or even settings without leaving the comforts of your own home. You can also meet so many different personalities from whom you can learn useful insights and values. Another benefit is that it develops your thinking skills. predicting what will happen next, criticizing a character for what he or she has done, and imagining the landscape as it is described are all thinking skills that you use when you read. Lastly, reading makes you a better writer. As you read, you experience how other people write. You learn various ways in which ideas can be expressed, and in learning so, it helps you to choose the best way to write your Own ideas. While it is true that reading is a boring activity, you can never argue against the advantages it brings you.​</a>

"While each nation has its own strategy in fighting the pandemic, what the world needs are coordinated international plans and efforts to pursue a common purpose. COVID-19 knows no border. It knows no nationality. It knows no race. It knows no gender. It knows no age. It knows no creed." 2. "The same urgency needed to fight COVID-19 is needed to address the climate crisis. This is a global challenge that has worsened existing inequalities and vulnerabilities from within and between nations. Climate change has worsened the ravages of the pandemic." 3.

                            17. Directions: Identify what Literary Criticism is applicable to the following. (STRUCTURALISM, MORAL CRITICISM, MARXISM, FEMINISM, HISTORICAL APPROACH, READER-RESPONSE APPROACH)____________________1. The bible teaches us the value of forgiveness through the parable of The Prodigal Son, wherein the son asked for his inheritance from his father and left. He wasted all his inheritance and came back to his father empty-handed. He expected that he would have to beg for his father to take him back despite what he did. To his surprise, he was warmly welcomed by his father without hesitation. He was forgiven despite all his mistakes.____________________2. In the story of Cinderella, the Prince came from a rich family of royalties while Cinderella is just a poor commoner. Cinderella’s stepmother believes that she is not fit for the Prince because they live in two separate worlds of the rich and the poor.____________________3. The novel, Animal Farm, written by George Orwell was published in 1945. This novel is an allegory - even though it is set on a farm and stars a cast of farm animals, it reflects the events of the Russian revolution of 1917. The animals are all clever representations of Russian politicians, voters and workers. Orwell used the novel to make his opinions on Russian leaders. He couldn’t blatantly attack these leaders in his writings because of the censorship that British Media imposed during the 1940s just to get support from Soviet Union, so he allegorically criticized them using The Animal Farm. During the censorship, anti-Stalin and anti-Soviet writings were put on hold and were never published in Great Britain.____________________4. On June 17, 2018, workers at NurtiAsia Philippines went on a strike against low wages and unhealthy working conditions. The workers also alleged that NutriAsia practiced contractualization -- extending regular employment agreements to less than 10 percent of its 1,400-person workforce. The protest resulted in violent dispersal of the workers and on July 5 of the same year, Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) ordered NutriAsia to regularize 80 contractual workers.____________________5. The Autobiography of Veronica Franco, an Italian poet and a courtesan (sex worker in Renaissance Italy) talks about her struggles as a woman to gain a spot in the world of literature dominated mostly by men of nobility. She was labeled as an ‘honest courtesan’ for she fully disclosed in her autobiography her sexual relationships with intellectuals, noble men, and even with Kings. She used her social status as a courtesan to establish a name in literature because at that time, women did not have much voice in the society. What Veronica did was discuss and expose sexual issues, and for that, she was attacked by some of her male acquaintances for her boldness because men expected women to be reserved during that era.​</h2><br />

                            20. Read the following excepts and tell if the information provided shows cause and effect, classification, comparison, definition, or description. ___1. There are four types of transportation available in the metro. A tricycle is a motorcycle with an attached side car. It is used to transport people within villages or to nearby locations. Next, a jeepney is a homegrown transportation that can fit 16 to 22 people at a time. Its body components are usually made of stainless steel with fanciful decors. Inside, passengers will have to sit in a long cushioned bench on each side of the cab. A rather common type is the bus. Buses can fit in a maximum of 60 people at a time, and may follow a city or provincial route. Lastly is the train. Currently. there are four active train lines in Manila: the L RTA lines 1 and 2, the MRT3, and the PNR. Each train line has a specific route and it is the fastest way to get around the city.___2.If I have a choice, I would rather live by the sea than on a mountain. It's nice to wake up to the sound of the lapping waves and the smell of the fresh sea breeze. Unlike in the mountain where there's nothing much to see but trees, trees, and only trees. By the shore, you can do many things. You may dip your feet onto the cold sea water, play with sand, go boating, observe shells the choices are endless! I doubt if you can do as many things on a mountain. I can't think of any activity that I can do if ever I would live on a mountain, that's why I would rather live by the sea.1___3. Camiguin is an island off the coast of Mindanao. It is an island that formed out of one or several volcanic eruptions, thus it's called the island born of fire Despite it being the second smallest province in - the Philippines, it has so many things to offer. It has a beautiful sandbar, called White Island, which is not exactly an island but a landmass made of powdery white sand. The place is ideal for swimming as it is surrounded by clear water and two volcanoes. Another sight to behold in Camiguin is its rich coral and sea life, which may be seen when you go snorkeling in Mantigue Island. It is an islet that also has powdery white sand and blue crystal clear water. Camiguin Island itself boasts of other water forms such as falls, hot, and cold springs. Katibawasan Falls is a 250-feet high falls that cascades onto a rock pool surrounded by orchids, ferns, and boulders. Its cold water is suitable for anyone in need of being revitalized from the hot summer days. Truly, if you are in need of a refreshing summer, head off to Camiguin and witness the beauty nature has to offer.___4. The term slacktivist is a blending of two words: slacker and activist. A slacktivist is a person that performs activism online, through social media. A slacktivist's posts are usually about his or her personal advocacies, or criticism of certain personalities, issues, events, or of the government in general. It is a convenient way of voicing protest as it is only done in the comforts of one's home or favorite nook.___5. Reading is an activity that many people do not appreciate. There are so many benefits to reading. For one, reading allows you to travel to different places, time periods, or even settings without leaving the comforts of your own home. You can also meet so many different personalities from whom you can learn useful insights and values. Another benefit is that it develops your thinking skills. predicting what will happen next, criticizing a character for what he or she has done, and imagining the landscape as it is described are all thinking skills that you use when you read. Lastly, reading makes you a better writer. As you read, you experience how other people write. You learn various ways in which ideas can be expressed, and in learning so, it helps you to choose the best way to write your Own ideas. While it is true that reading is a boring activity, you can never argue against the advantages it brings you.​</h2><br />
