You're a special placeYou're where I want to wake up,Where meals are served steaming.Where families feast on fresh delights of the sea.Where air is fresh and clean and pure over the sea.Here in this big city,Most food is either frozen or canned,And the air is a blanket of smog.I wish I could be back homeWhere vegetables come fresh from the gardenWhere we broil fish that comes straight from the sea,Where chicken meat hasn't sat in a freezer for a day.I wish I had a fairy's wand to whisk me homeWhere no factories and noisy cars pollute the air,Where the silence of the night is brokenOnly by the lapping of the waves on the shore,Where fireflies, instead of electric bulbs,Light up the night.Home, that's where I want to be,And I hope someday, soon, that's where I will be.What Is ItBased from the poem above, answer the given questions and provide evidences for yourunderstanding1.

                                            The Wooden BowlA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law,and four-year-old grandson. The old man's handstrembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered.The family ate together at the table. But the elderlygrandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eatingdifficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. Whenhe grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with themess. "We must do something about father," said theson. "I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating,and food on the floor." So the husband and wife set asmall table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alonewhile the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. SinceGrandfather had broken a dish or two, his food wasserved in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced inGrandfather's direction, sometimes he had a tear in hiseye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple hadfor him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a forkor spilled food.The four-year-old watched it all in silence.One evening before supper, the father noticed his sonplaying with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the childsweetly, "What are you making?" Just as sweetly, theboy responded, "Oh, I am making a little bowl for you andMama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.The words so struck the parents so that they werespeechless. Then tears started to stream down theircheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew whatmust be done.That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand andgently led him back to the family table. For the remainderof his day, he ate every meal with the family. And forsome reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to careany longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or thetablecloth soiled.QUESTIONS:1.

Encircle the letter of the correct answer if there are choices.Why does a cow chewing when she isn’t eating?		A cow has a special stomach with four parts.  When she eats grass, she chews it just enough to make it wet.  Then it goes into the first part of her stomach, where it becomes softer.  From there it goes into the second part, where it is made into little balls called “cuds”.  Later, while the cow is resting, she brings up each cud one at a time and chews it well.  When she swallows it, the food goes into the third part of her stomach.  There the water is squeezed out of it.  Finally, the food goes to the fourth part of the cow’s stomach and is broken down into very tiny pieces.  Then the cow’s body can take what it needs from the food to live and grow.1.

                            3. The Wooden BowlA frail old man went to live with his son, daughter-in-law,and four-year-old grandson. The old man's handstrembled, his eyesight was blurred, and his step faltered.The family ate together at the table. But the elderlygrandfather's shaky hands and failing sight made eatingdifficult. Peas rolled off his spoon onto the floor. Whenhe grasped the glass, milk spilled on the tablecloth.The son and daughter-in-law became irritated with themess. "We must do something about father," said theson. "I've had enough of his spilled milk, noisy eating,and food on the floor." So the husband and wife set asmall table in the corner. There, Grandfather ate alonewhile the rest of the family enjoyed dinner. SinceGrandfather had broken a dish or two, his food wasserved in a wooden bowl! When the family glanced inGrandfather's direction, sometimes he had a tear in hiseye as he sat alone. Still, the only words the couple hadfor him were sharp admonitions when he dropped a forkor spilled food.The four-year-old watched it all in silence.One evening before supper, the father noticed his sonplaying with wood scraps on the floor. He asked the childsweetly, "What are you making?" Just as sweetly, theboy responded, "Oh, I am making a little bowl for you andMama to eat your food in when I grow up." The four-year-old smiled and went back to work.The words so struck the parents so that they werespeechless. Then tears started to stream down theircheeks. Though no word was spoken, both knew whatmust be done.That evening the husband took Grandfather's hand andgently led him back to the family table. For the remainderof his day, he ate every meal with the family. And forsome reason, neither husband nor wife seemed to careany longer when a fork was dropped, milk spilled, or thetablecloth soiled.QUESTIONS:1. If you were the old man in the story, how will you feelon how your son treat you?2. How should you treat your parents or elders in thefamily?3. What does this story teach you? pa answer po​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>1.)</strong><strong> </strong>I would feel hurt, if my son treats me unfairly and I did not deserve it.  He should not be doing that to me because I am an old man, who needs love and care at my old age.  A young man who does not understand or appreciate me, might have to bear the same consequences when he is old as well.  His son might be treating him in the same way, and he might regret how poorly he had treated me when he gets old too.</p><p></p><p><strong>2.)</strong> You should treat your parents or elders in the family kindly and with respect. They are the foundation to the family's stability, and their wisdom can be passed down to you and benefit your life greatly. It is common for a child to treat his or her elders unfairly because the child does not know any better.  But the adult should understand the value of their family members, and should treat them kindly and with respect.  Kindness and respect are very effective tools for maintaining the peace in a family.  They are essential for all relationships, not just the ones with elders.</p><p></p><p><strong>3</strong><strong>.</strong><strong>)</strong><strong> </strong><strong> </strong>This story teaches me to treat my elders with respect and kindness.  It also teaches me that even the smallest of deeds can have the biggest impact.  If I treat my elders with respect, it might inspire them to treat me with respect as well.  We never know how our actions might affect others, so it is important to be respectful whenever possible. Also, being kind to others can make us feel good about ourselves.</p><br />

Encircle the letter of the correct answer if there are choices.Why does a cow chewing when she isn’t eating?		A cow has a special stomach with four parts.  When she eats grass, she chews it just enough to make it wet.  Then it goes into the first part of her stomach, where it becomes softer.  From there it goes into the second part, where it is made into little balls called “cuds”.  Later, while the cow is resting, she brings up each cud one at a time and chews it well.  When she swallows it, the food goes into the third part of her stomach.  There the water is squeezed out of it.  Finally, the food goes to the fourth part of the cow’s stomach and is broken down into very tiny pieces.  Then the cow’s body can take what it needs from the food to live and grow.1.
