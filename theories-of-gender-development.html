Edwards (2007) explored the process of college men’s gender identity development. In order to try to meet these expectations and be seen as men, participants described putting on a performance that was like wearing a mask or “putting my man face on.” This process included learning societal expectations of them as men, as well as specific cultural group expectations. The men in this study were all aware that they did not neatly fit behind the mask, either as a result of personal characteristics or social identities. Their resulting insecurities led them to wearing the mask both consciously and unconsciously so that they would be seen as men by society. Select one: a. Ethnographic Research b. Action Research c.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The social learning theory and the cognitive development theory.</p><p></p><p>Social Learning Theory:</p><p>The social learning theory suggests that gender roles and behaviors are learned through observation, imitation, and reinforcement from the people and environment around us. Children learn from observing others and imitating the behaviors and attitudes they see. They also receive reinforcement or punishment for their behaviors and learn from the consequences of their actions. This theory suggests that gender roles are not innate but are learned through socialization.</p><p>For example, a child may learn to exhibit stereotypical gender roles by observing their parents' behaviors. If a child sees their mother performing housework and taking care of the children, while their father works outside the home, the child may learn that these are the appropriate gender roles. Similarly, if a child is praised for exhibiting gender-appropriate behaviors, such as a girl being praised for being nurturing or a boy being praised for being tough, they may continue to exhibit these behaviors.</p><p></p><p>Cognitive Development Theory:</p><p>The cognitive development theory suggests that children actively construct their own understanding of gender through their experiences and interactions with the environment around them. Children develop schemas, or mental representations, of what it means to be male or female based on their observations and experiences. As children develop, they refine these schemas and integrate new information into their understanding of gender.</p><p>For example, a child may develop a schema for what it means to be a boy based on their observations of other boys around them. As they interact with more people and gain new experiences, they may refine their schema to include more complex ideas about gender, such as the idea that boys can also have emotions and be nurturing. Another example is a child who may question why they cannot wear dresses if they are a boy, challenging the idea that clothing is gendered.</p><p></p><p>Explanation</p><p></p><p>both the social learning theory and cognitive development theory offer insights into how children develop an understanding of gender. The social learning theory emphasizes the importance of environmental factors, while the cognitive development theory emphasizes the role of the child's own thinking and experiences.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Psychoanalysis:a system of psychological theory and therapy which aims to treat mental disorders by investigating the interaction of conscious and unconscious elements in the mind and bringing repressed fears and conflicts into the conscious mind by techniques such as dream interpretation and free association.</p><p></p><p>Feminist Theory:Feminist theory is the extension of feminism into theoretical, fictional, or philosophical discourse. It aims to understand the nature of gender inequality. It examines women's and men's social roles, experiences, interests, chores, and feminist politics in a variety of fields, such as anthropology and sociology, communication, media studies, psychoanalysis, ecology, home economics, literature, education, and philosophy.</p><p></p><p>Phenomenology: (from Greek φαινόμενον, phainómenon "that which appears" and λόγος, lógos "study") is the philosophical study of the structures of experience and consciousness. As a philosophical movement it was founded in the early years of the 20th century by Edmund Husserl and was later expanded upon by a circle of his followers at the universities of Göttingen and Munich in Germany. It then spread to France, the United States, and elsewhere, often in contexts far removed from Husserl's early work.</p><p></p><p>Rational Choice: According to the definition of rational choice theory , every choice that is made is completed by first considering the costs, risks and benefits of making that decision. Choices that seem irrational to one person may make perfect sense to another based on the individual's desires.</p><p></p><p>Human-Environment Systems: A coupled human–environment system characterizes the dynamical two-way interactions between human systems and natural systems. This coupling expresses the idea that the evolution of humans and environmental systems may no longer be treated as individual isolated systems.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

The men in this study were all aware that they did not neatly fit behind the mask, either as a result of personal characteristics or social identities. Their resulting insecurities led them to wearing the mask both consciously and unconsciously so that they would be seen as men by society. Select one: a. Ethnographic Research b. Action Research c.
