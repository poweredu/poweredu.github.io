Western wall was the first place of worship for Judaism 3. Seventh Day Adventist do not eat pork. 4. Catholics cannot marry if they do not undergo the sacrament of confirmation 5. Muslims read the Qur'an 6. Buddhists believed i mass.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.) Ancient Filipinos were animistic. They believed that <strong>everything has a spirit, from rocks and trees to animals and humans to natural phenomena</strong>. These spirits are collectively known as anito, derived from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian *qanitu and Proto-Austronesian *qaNiCu ("spirit of the dead").</p><p></p><p>2.)Because of the Temple Mount entry restrictions, the Wall is the holiest place where Jews are permitted to pray, though the Foundation Stone, the most sacred site in the Jewish faith, lies behind it.</p><p></p><p>3.)Pork, rabbit, and shellfish are<strong> considered “unclean” </strong>and thus banned by Adventists. However, some Adventists choose to eat certain “clean” meats, such as fish, poultry, and red meats other than pork, as well as other animal products like eggs and low-fat dairy ( 5 ).</p><p></p><p>4.)Yes but…</p><p></p><p>According to Canon Law all Catholics requesting the sacrament of marriage should be fully initiated (Baptized; 1st Communion; Confirmation) prior to the wedding. So if there is time, the unconfirmed person can join and RCIA program, get confirmed and then get married after Easter.</p><p></p><p>However, the pastor/marrying priest can waive the Confirmation piece if having the bride and/or the groom get confirmed causes a grave inconvenience.</p><p></p><p>Here in the Diocese of Raleigh we have three major military installations: Fort Bragg, Camp Lejeune, and Marine Corp Air Station Cherry Point. Due to deployments and transfers couples may not have an opportunity to go through RCIA to get confirmed. So the priest can easily marry them as not being confirmed does not interfere with the conferral of the Sacrament of Marriage.</p><p></p><p>In the end it is at the discretion of the priest performing the marriage. And, all of the priests I know are very flexible and willing to marry an unconfirmed person because I and they are just happy to see the couple getting married in the church.</p><p></p><p>5.) The 114 chapters, or Surahs, of the Qur'an are divided into 30 parts, which makes it possible for a Muslim to complete a reading of the whole Qur'an in a month. They often recite one part each day, especially during the month <strong>of Ramadan</strong> . Many Muslims learn parts of the Qur'an by heart.</p><p></p><p>6.)Buddhism is one of the world's largest religions and originated 2,500 years ago in India. Buddhists believe that <strong>the human life is one of suffering</strong>, and that meditation, spiritual and physical labor, and good behavior are the ways to achieve enlightenment, or nirvana.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>have a nc day^^</p><p></p><br />

</strong></p>
Spirituality:
<p>One does not need to attain a quest for faith in order to attain spirituality. This comes from the fact that spirituality means differently for different people. There are experiences that are spiritual in nature but are categorized as non – religious such as meditation, quiet reflection, private prayer, time with nature, and yoga.  
</p><p>
Higher levels of spirituality have been linked to improved self-esteem, increased compassion, and strengthened relationships. Spirituality is an extensive concept that involves many ideas. In general, it includes a sense of connection to something bigger than oneselves, and it typically involves a search for a meaningful life.

</strong></p>
Sacred Space:
<p>A <strong>sacred space</strong> is considered <strong>an element of religion.</strong> Sacred space includes <strong>a wide variety of very different kinds of places.</strong> It includes <strong>places that are built for religious purposes including temples or temenoi, and places that are religiously interpreted including mountains or rivers.</strong> It includes spaces that can be entered physically, as the outer geography of a holy land, inspirationally, as the inner geography of the body in Tantric yoga, or visually, as the space of a mandala.
</p><p>
This view of sacred space as a lens for meaning implies that places are sacred because they perform a religious function, not because they have peculiar physical or aesthetic qualities. Three roles of sacred space are especially significant, for they are widely attested in religious systems and fundamental to their purposes. First, sacred space is a means of communication with the gods and about the gods. Second, it is a place of divine power. And third, it serves as a visible icon of the world and thereby imparts a form to it and an organization to its inhabitants.
</p>
Worldview:
<p><strong>Worldview </strong>refers to the <strong>particular way of ordering the realities of one’s world.</strong> Worldview is more than culture as it extends to perceptions of time and space, of happiness and of well-being. In fact, the beliefs, values, and behaviors of a culture stem from its worldviews. Derived from the German term ‘weltanschauung,’ the term worldview refers to the series of beliefs an individual have regarding the most significant concepts of life such as God, the cosmos (universe), and humanity. These beliefs, which may or may not be true, form a general picture, a broad-spectrum outlook, or a grand perspective on life and the world.
