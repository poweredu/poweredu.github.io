                            9. Fs 2 episode 6 deductive and inductive methods of teaching answer</h2><br />
                        Two very distinct and opposing instructional approaches are inductive and deductive method of teaching. Both approaches can offer certain advantages, but the biggest difference is the role of the teacher.<br /><br />Deductive - The teacher conducts the lesson by introducing and explaining concepts; this approach is very teacher-centered. This means that teacher gives the student new concept, explains it, and then has the student practice using the concept: For example, when teaching a new grammar concept, the teacher will introduce the concept, explain the rules related to its use, and finally the students will practice using the concept in a variety of ways.<br /><br />Inductive - Is much more student-centered approach and makes use of strategy known as "noticing". Instead of explaining a given concept and following his explanation with examples, the teacher presents students with many examples showing how the concept is used. The intent is for the students to notice, by the way of the examples, how the concept works.<br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>Ang Amaya ay isang epikong drama sa telebisyon na ginawa ng GMA 7. Ito ay umiikot sa buhay ng isang magandang babae na nagngangalang Amaya, na nagmula sa kaharian ng mga taga-puti. Sa unang episode, nakilala natin ang mga pangunahing tauhan sa kuwento, kabilang si Amaya, ang kanyang ama na si Datu Bugna, at ang kanyang mga kapatid.</p><p></p><p>Nagsimula ang kwento sa isang pag-atake ng mga taga-itim sa kanilang kaharian. Nakipaglaban si Datu Bugna at ang kanyang mga mandirigma upang protektahan ang kanilang kaharian. Ngunit sa huli, sila ay natalo at nasakop ng mga taga-itim.</p><p></p><p>Sa gitna ng mga pangyayari, si Amaya ay nawawala at napadpad sa kagubatan. Doon ay nakilala niya si Bagani, isang katutubong naninirahan sa gubat. Tinulungan siya ni Bagani at itinuring siyang isang miyembro ng kanilang tribo.</p><p></p><p>Sa kabila ng mga pagsubok na hinaharap ni Amaya, tuluyan siyang naging matapang at nakapagpatunay na may kabayanihan rin ang mga kababaihan. Ang unang episode ng Amaya ay nagpakita ng malalim na pagmamahal sa pamilya, kaibigan, at pagpapakumbaba ng isang taong may pinagmulang nakaraan.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
