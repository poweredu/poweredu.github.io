Born in Manila, he was educated at the Art School of the Liceo de Manila, the University of the Philippines School of Fine Arts, and spent time abroad in Spain and the United States. Lauded for his skill in depicting light and form, Amorsolo is well known for his paintings of idyllic Philippine rural life. He rejected Western ideals of beauty and sought to promote Filipino beauty instead, and his use of chiaroscuro became an artistic trademark that set his work apart from the rest. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p> correct me if im wrong</p><p></p><br />
