Case Study
You are the head of a large department and several supervisors report to you.
Recently you were confronted with a knotty problem. It seems that one of the supervisors
had gotten into a loud and disagreeable argument with an employee. You called the
supervisor to your office to hear his story.
The supervisor admitted losing his temper and shouting at the employee, but he
believed it was justified. He had been observing the employee over the year the man had
been with the company. During this period the employee had been frequently late, and his
absentee rate was above average. In addition, the supervisor went on to say that the
employee was a socializer on the job, frequently leaving his work to talk to other
employees and to use the telephone for personal calls. The supervisor then said that the
proverbial last straw caused his outburst. The employee had come in late, and after about
an hour of work he made a telephone call which the supervisor had timed as lasting 14
minutes. The supervisor then started his tirade. The employee denied being on the
telephone that long, the supervisor called him a liar, and they continued the vituperative
exchange which ended when you called the supervisor to your office.
After listening to the supervisor, you asked him if he had disciplined the employee
before, since apparently he had a poor record. You also asked if the employee had been
placed on probation or had been warned. The supervisor looked at you sheepishly and
seemed reluctant to answer. You pressed him, for an answer, and he finally blurted out that
he was afraid to discipline the employee because he was black. He stated that the
impression he had from you and higher management was that black employees should be
given special treatment so that they would feel welcome and not discriminated against. He
felt the company wanted to impress the public with its forward-looking employment
practices and didn't want any trouble with the black community. As a result, he was lax in
discipline and had kept a hands-off approach with all black employees until his outburst.
He said he couldn't stand it anymore, and the 14-mintue telephone call caused him to lose
his temper.

                                            pleshActivity 1: Let's Identify!Directions: Read and analyze the texts that you are about to read. Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019. On 30 January 2020, the Philippine Department of Health reportedthe first case of COVID-19 in the country with a 38-year-old female Chinese national.On 7 March, the first local transmission of COVID-19was confirmed. WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2. What writing technique used from each of the given texts?3. How do these various writing techniques help you in your writing?​</a>

They're all in good shape. They're all18, 19, 20, 21 and 22-year-olds. They're healthy... And people say that's crazy.

Case Study
You are the head of a large department and several supervisors report to you.
Recently you were confronted with a knotty problem. It seems that one of the supervisors
had gotten into a loud and disagreeable argument with an employee. You called the
supervisor to your office to hear his story.
The supervisor admitted losing his temper and shouting at the employee, but he
believed it was justified. He had been observing the employee over the year the man had
been with the company. During this period the employee had been frequently late, and his
absentee rate was above average. In addition, the supervisor went on to say that the
employee was a socializer on the job, frequently leaving his work to talk to other
employees and to use the telephone for personal calls. The supervisor then said that the
proverbial last straw caused his outburst. The employee had come in late, and after about
an hour of work he made a telephone call which the supervisor had timed as lasting 14
minutes. The supervisor then started his tirade. The employee denied being on the
telephone that long, the supervisor called him a liar, and they continued the vituperative
exchange which ended when you called the supervisor to your office.
After listening to the supervisor, you asked him if he had disciplined the employee
before, since apparently he had a poor record. You also asked if the employee had been
placed on probation or had been warned. The supervisor looked at you sheepishly and
seemed reluctant to answer. You pressed him, for an answer, and he finally blurted out that
he was afraid to discipline the employee because he was black. He stated that the
impression he had from you and higher management was that black employees should be
given special treatment so that they would feel welcome and not discriminated against. He
felt the company wanted to impress the public with its forward-looking employment
practices and didn't want any trouble with the black community. As a result, he was lax in
discipline and had kept a hands-off approach with all black employees until his outburst.
He said he couldn't stand it anymore, and the 14-mintue telephone call caused him to lose
his temper.

                            19. pleshActivity 1: Let's Identify!Directions: Read and analyze the texts that you are about to read. Then identify what writing technique is uded in each text.Text 1The idea of school uniforms seems like an outmoded concept for many students in the Philippines especially to those who studied in publicschools. Yet, around the world, wearing school uniforms has been the rule. Students studying whether in private or public schools are required to wear school uniforms. Often, the cause of bullying in schools are from people being different for not wearing the precise clothes. If someone looks richer, most people feel like they have a higher social status or more power. To the contrary, uniforms allow students to learn on a fairer level, with less judgment aboutchoices of clothing, brands, or physical appearance. A lot of students who wear school uniforms claimed that they feelprouder of their school. Wearing school colors gives students a feeling of being more connected to their school and classmates or even in the community. Wearing schdol uniforms can also help people gain more selfconfidence because they will be identified as part of the institution.Text 2The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new strain of coronavirus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China,in December 2019. On 30 January 2020, the Philippine Department of Health reportedthe first case of COVID-19 in the country with a 38-year-old female Chinese national.On 7 March, the first local transmission of COVID-19was confirmed. WHO is working closely with the Department of Health inresponding to the COVD419 outbreak.Text 3Education is the key to success as an old adage goes. A good education can teach a child how to learn and to have an independent learning. It may also teach a child how to reason so that a child does not grow up to be ignorant. There are a lot of reasons why education is important in our society today. One of these is it helps people how to learn. It is not how the child accumulate knowledge either in the school or at home but how the child is taught to learn things differently. If the child has been taught how to learn,then he will bring such learning until he becomes an adult. Such learning will teach him to succeed in the future.If education is not seen as important, then one day it will just be all about school scores and will be just a part of the curriculum. Without education, learning is hard to achieve.Now it's time to answer the following questions.1. What can you say about the texts that you have just read?2. What writing technique used from each of the given texts?3. How do these various writing techniques help you in your writing?​</h2><br />
