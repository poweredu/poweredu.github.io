                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Third Commandment of the Ten Commandments could refer to: "Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain" under the Philonic division used by Hellenistic Jews, Greek Orthodox and Protestants except Lutherans, or the Talmudic division of the third-century Jewish Talmud.</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Attending Sunday masses for Catholics and Christian day worship for others are examples of fulfilling the third commandment. But it doesn't mean that you go to mass and you actively participate in the entire mass, you are already fulfilling the third commandment. The challenge is always after we went to mass. Are we able to inspire our neighbors through our actions, words and deeds that we are really faithful Sunday mass goers? Can we say that we are living what we are learning from the church or we simply hear it but we didn't imply it. Going to mass also takes a great responsibility because we can inspire other to go to mass or we can move them away because of our way of living.</p><p></p><p></p><p>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Remember to keep Holy the Sabbath Day</p><p>The third commandments are usually neglected by the people of this generation. Most of the people are too busy in their business, in their work or the most commonly reason is that, Sunday is their only day to rest and do their laundry and other household stuff. We didn't pay attention to the essence of hearing the mass. We just going to spend almost 1 to 1.5 hours in the church, and most of us can't make it. But if you tell them they will watch movie or a concert that will last for more than 2 hours, many people will go.

                            15. Explain thoroughly the meaning of the third commandment?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>From Exodus 20:7, the Third Commandment reads: You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain, for the LORD will not hold him guiltless who takes his name in vain. So, what does this mean? Literally, this means to falsify who God is and what He stands for.</p><p>
</p><p>What does the Third Commandment mean? How do I keep a day holy?
</p><p>The Catechism starts its reflection on the Third Commandment with the scriptural meaning of the Sabbath. Exodus 20:8-11 states that the Sabbath was the seventh day on which the Lord rested after the work of the previous six days. Deuteronomy 5:12 adds that the Sabbath is a day of our renewing the covenant with God. The Sabbath is connected to creation and covenant.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The parable of the Good Samaritan is told by Jesus in the Gospel of Luke.[1] It is about a traveler (implicitly understood to be Jewish) who is stripped of clothing, beaten, and left half dead alongside the road. First, a Jewish priest and then a Levite come by, but both avoid the man. Finally, a Samaritan happens upon the traveler. Although Samaritans and Jews despised each other, the Samaritan helps the injured man. Jesus is described as telling the parable in response to a provocative question from a lawyer, "And who is my neighbor?", in the context of the Great Commandment. The conclusion is that the neighbor figure in the parable is the one who shows mercy to their fellow man.</p><br />

                                            <h2 class="ez-toc-section" id="what-are-the-two-emphases-of-the-third-commandments-%e2%80%8b">
                            28. what are the two emphases of the third commandments? ​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>It is not hard to determine what the most common sin is. It is idolatry, a sin of commission. Five commandments bear directly on it: the first, second, third, fourth, and tenth. In addition, the others easily become involved in idolatry by being broken in their spirit. This article will focus on another commandment, the third, that connects directly with the sin of idolatry. Many of us do not generally understand its purpose. In fact, most of us understand it only in its most obvious application, and thus unknowingly, we may break it frequently.</p><p></p><p>Recall that the first commandment deals with what we worship. Our worship is to be directed toward the unique Creator, the Source of all things, and toward Him only. The second deals with the way we worship, in spirit and truth. No one has ever seen the unique Creator God, so we must use no figments of human imagination to portray Him. The third involves the sincere truthfulness, purity, and quality of our worship. It deals with glorifying God.</p><p></p><p>Isaiah 40:18, 25 asks, "To whom then will you liken God? Or what likeness will you compare to Him? . . . 'To whom then will you liken Me, or to whom shall I be equal?' says the Holy One." From the second commandment, it is obvious that God expressly forbids the making of any representation of Him. Any such picture or statue is automatically a lie because, other than knowing that we are in His physical image as to form and shape, everything else that He is cannot be expressed in a mere physical depiction.</p><p></p><p>John 1:18 confirms this truth: "No one has seen God at any time. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him." God is unique; nothing compares with Him. There is no point of contact, no physical reference, to which a human being can compare Him, revealing the absolute folly of image-making. Even Jesus' declarations regarding God are never about what He looks like, but are all about His authority, position, purpose, character, and attributes.</p><p></p><p>However, knowing the importance of His purpose to our lives, should we not strive to learn what He is like? God does not want us concerned about what He looks like, for that puts the emphasis in the wrong area. He gives us enough information for us to know that He looks like a man—and that is enough.</p><p></p><p>However, He greatly desires that we know what He is. The entire Bible reveals His mind, character, attributes, offices, power, will, promises, plan, and relationship to us. The third commandment deals with these areas of study and application because they deeply affect the quality of our response to Him.</p><p></p><p>The Commandment</p><p></p><p>Exodus 20:7 says, "You shall not take the name of the Lord your God in vain, for the Lord will not hold him guiltless who takes His name in vain." This commandment, like the second, includes a warning within it. What does He mean by "not hold him guiltless"? Sometimes God deliberately understates a warning as a subtle form of emphasis, which ultimately magnifies its meaning. The penalty for taking God's name in vain is death!</p><p></p><p>It is helpful to define four words used in this command:</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Gospel of Matthew
</p><p>And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. “Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?” And he said to him, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets.”
</p><p>
</p><p>— Matthew 22:35-40
</p><p>Gospel of Mark
</p><p>In the Gospel of Mark, the Shema is included:
</p><p>
</p><p>And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, “Which commandment is the most important of all?” Jesus answered, “The most important is, ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ The second is this: ‘You shall love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no other commandment greater than these.”
</p><p>
</p><p>— Mark 12:28-31
</p><p>Gospel of Luke
</p><p>And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test, saying, “Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?” He said to him, “What is written in the Law? How do you read it?” And he answered, “You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your strength and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself.” And he said to him, “You have answered correctly; do this, and you will live.
</p><p>
</p><p>— Luke 10:25-28
</p><p>Gospel of John
</p><p>When he had gone out, Jesus said, “Now is the Son of Man glorified, and God is glorified in him. If God is glorified in him, God will also glorify him in himself, and glorify him at once. Little children, yet a little while I am with you. You will seek me, and just as I said to the Jews, so now I also say to you, ‘Where I am going you cannot come.' A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another: just as I have loved you, you also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples, if you have love for one another.”
</p><p>
</p><p>— John 13:31-35
</p><p>Old Testament references
</p><p>Leviticus 19:9-18
</p><p>18 "You shall not take vengeance or bear a grudge against the sons of your own people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself: I am the Lord."
</p><p>
</p><p>Deuteronomy
</p><p>Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one LORD: And thou shalt love the LORD thy God with all thine heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy might.
</p><p>
</p><p>— Deuteronomy 6:4-5
</p><p>Love the Lord thy God
</p><p>See also: Agape and Love of God (Christianity)
</p><p>Matthew Henry sums up the question of which is the great commandment:
</p><p>
</p><p>It was a question disputed among the critics in the Law. Some would have the Law of Circumcision to be the Great Commandment, others the Law of the Sabbath, others the Law of Sacrifices, according as they severally stood affected, and spent their zeal; now they would try what Christ said to this question, hoping to incense the people against him, if he should not answer according to the vulgar opinion; and if he should magnify one commandment, they would reflect on him as vilifying the rest.[5]
</p><p>
</p><p>Adam Clarke, in his Commentary on the Bible, wrote:
</p><p>
</p><p>This is the first and great commandment. It is "first and greatest":
</p><p>
</p><p>In its antiquity; being as old as the world, and engraved originally on our very nature.
</p><p>In its dignity; as directly and immediately proceeding from and referring to God.
</p><p>In its excellence; being the commandment of the new covenant, and the very spirit of the Divine adoption.
</p><p>In its justice; because it alone renders to God his due, prefers him before all things, and secures to him his proper rank in relation to them.
</p><p>In its sufficiency; being in itself capable of making men holy in this life, and happy in the other.
</p><p>In its fruitfulness; because it is the root of all commandments, and the fulfilling of the law.
</p><p>In its virtue and efficacy; because by this alone God reigns in the heart of humans, and humans are united to God.
</p><p>In its extent; leaving nothing to the creature, which it does not refer to the Creator.
</p><p>In its necessity; being absolutely indispensable.
</p><p>In its duration; ever to be continued on earth, and never to be discontinued in heaven.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>OKIE NA PO</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The third commandment of the Ten Commandments, as recorded in the Bible, is "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy" (Exodus 20:8). This commandment directs people to set aside one day a week for rest and worship, and to honor and respect this day as a time of spiritual devotion.</p><p></p><p>As members of the Church, we can follow this commandment by setting aside time on Sunday (or another day designated as the Sabbath in our particular faith tradition) for worship and spiritual reflection. This can involve attending religious services, participating in prayer and devotional activities, and engaging in acts of charity and service to others.</p><p></p><p>We can also honor the Sabbath by refraining from work and other activities that might distract from the spiritual focus of the day. This might involve avoiding unnecessary labor or leisure activities, and instead using the time to rest, meditate, and connect with God and our fellow believers.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, the goal of this commandment is to help us cultivate a deeper relationship with God and to make time for rest, reflection, and spiritual growth in our busy lives. By following this commandment, we can draw closer to God and find greater meaning and purpose in our lives.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />
