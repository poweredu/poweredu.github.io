                                            My name is Shekinah. I have a big family. I understand the point of having such a big family. Living in a big family is such a headache. I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me. One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi 1 told them i will just stay home and do my homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to make them leave. Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One moment I was in terrible pain and the next thing I remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident, I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of family Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor. Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love my family so much that I can't live without them.

                                            EVALUATION:
DIRECTIONS: Read each text carefully and distinguish the persuasive-text type. Write YES if
it persuades and NO if it does not. Write your answer before the number.
________1. Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol’s
most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in
pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not manmade. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the
construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at
the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that
the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty.
Book now and travel to Bohol with your family!
________2. The crocodile and the alligator are cousins. They both live in water and
on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a
narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The
crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat
turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any
kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer.
_________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They
are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The
three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are
clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A
few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds
called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat,
sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus
clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the
house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring
an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.
___________4. A cat is the perfect pet. Cats are really so cute. They make people happy
by petting. It reduces stress because they are calm. Having a cat will be easy. I
will feed the cat. Yosef can help me clean the litter box. We will help together
to feed Snow. A cat would make for the perfect pet. Please get me a cat, Mom
and Dad!

Most people who first see the landscape in pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not man-made. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty. Book now and travel to Bohol with your family!________2. The crocodile and the alligator are cousins. They both live in water and on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer._________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat, sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.___________4. A cat is the perfect pet.

The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</a>

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.

He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Esmerelda comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Sister Gudule, screams at La Esmerelda for being a "gypsy child- thief" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Esmerelda is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Phoebus calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Frollo watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Phoebus. His obsessive lust for La Esmerelda has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Esmerelda like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night, he follows Phoebus to his tryst with La Esmerelda and stabs Phoebus repeatedly. He escapes and La Esmerelda is captured by the King's guard. After being tortured at her trial, La Esmerelda falsely confesses to killingPhoebus and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Grève. Frollo visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a "goblin-monk" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Esmerelda is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Phoebus and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Esmerelda and enters the house of his brideto-be. Just then, Quasimodo swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out "Sanctuary!" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along. La Esmerelda is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside thecathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Quasimodo, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Esmerelda after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she will be removed from Notre Dame. But when Quasimodo sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Esmerelda and he fend them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Frollo has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Esmerelda out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Sister Gudule. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Gudule tries to protect La Esmerelda, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Quasimodo goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Esmerelda in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Frollo by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Quasimodo sighs with grief and then throws Frollo down to his death. Looking at La Esmerelda hanging off in the distance and Frollo's wrangled corpse down below, Quasimodo cries out: "There is everything I ever loved!" Quasimodo is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Esmerelda's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her. (https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/summary/Guide Questions:1.

The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</a>

                                            GRADE 9- READING ACTIVITY WEEK 7 MACBETH A year or two before Edward the Confessor began to rule England: a battle was won in Scotland against a Norwegian King by two generals named Macbeth and Banquo. After the battle, the generals walked together towards Forres, in Elginshire, where Ouncan, King of Scotland was awaiting them. While they were crossing a lonely heath, they saw three women withered in appearance and wild in attire. “Hail. Macbeth, chieftain of Glamis.” said the first woman. “Hail. Macbeth, chieftain of Cawdor.” said the second woman. “Hail. Macbeth, King that is to be.” said the third woman. Then Banquo asked, “What of me?” and the third woman replied. “Thou shalt be the father of kings.” Banquo and Macbeth knew then that they had been addressed by witches and were discussing their prophecies. “The third witch called me, ‘King that is to be.’ “Banquo,” he said, ‘you see that the witches spoke truth concerning me. Do you not believe that your child and grandchild will be kings?” Banquo frowned. Macbeth thought the prophecy that he should be King too pleasant to keep to himself and he mentioned it to his wife in a letter. When Lady Macbeth. read his letter, she was determined that he should be King. When a messenger arrived to inform her that Duncan would pass a night in Macbeth’s castle. She told Macbeth as she saw him that Duncan must spend a sunless morrow. She meant that Duncan must die. After supper Duncan went to bed, and two grooms were placed on guard at his bedroom door. Lady Macbeth caused them to drink wine till they were stupefied. Macbeth came and found the daggers lying by the grooms; and soon with red hands appeared before his wile. The murderers heard a knocking. It was Macduff, the chieftain of Fife. Macbeth showed him the door of the King's room. Macduff entered, and came out again crying, "O horror!” Macbeth appeared as horror-stricken as Macduff and he slew the two grooms with their own daggers. Macbeth was crowned at Scone. Macbeth was King. Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? Write down their characterization. 2. What did the second woman say to Macbeth? 3. Who were addressing Macbeth and Banquo according to their prophecies? 4. What is the meaning of ‘sunless morrow’? 5. Who was crowned as the king at Scone? ​</a>

                                            With the rise and prominence of the Shri-Visayan Empire in the 6th to the 13th centuries, political dominance by conquests and wars took place. By the series of wars , the men population was depleted. In the course of time, the women folks by necessity in the scarcity of available men, had to take the place of the men in the battlefield so that they came to develop the high art of warfare to preserve their political state.
About seven hundred years ago, when Pangasinan was a kingdom, there lived a famous woman ruler in that dominion. Young, beautiful and well-educated, Princess Urduja was reputed to be a good warrior who had personally led her soldiers to the battlefields. Her retinue consisted of women skilled in arms, in riding horses and with well-built and well-developed bodies, prodigious strengh and masculine physique dubbed as Kinalakian or Kalakian or Amazon.
To the Pangasinan court many a suitor came, seeking for the hand of fair Urduja. The Princess said to them, “I will marry only the man who can defeat me. My husband must be braver , stronger, and wiser than myself.” As no one qualified to her demands, she remained unmarried all her life. For no one wished to be beaten by a woman. When her mother died, she became the ruler of Pangasinan region. Her bravery and skill were known far and near. She ruled her people well and wisely. Like the famous Amazons of old, Princess Urduja was not only intelligent, beautiful, and dominant, but also the very personification of kindness and virtue. One of her policies was to introduce the best of other countries adapted to her own. She was a woman who was interested in foreign affairs for the good of her own kingdom. She liked to hear the tales about India, the Pepper Country.An Arab traveller, Ibn Batuta, on his way to china, stopped at her kingdom. According to her custom, she invited the ship’s crew to a banquet. The Arab refused to go because he could not eat their food since they were “infidels”. The princess was offended and summoned him. He was surprised at what his eyes witnessed and his ears heard. For the Princess was robed in her richest and best, decked with precious stones and surrounded by brave and loyal men and women. She talked to the visitor in Arabian. This alone proved that she was a Moslem, knew her Koran, and therefore knew Arabic, she told him: “You, Priest, I have had you brought here by my guards because, of all of your ship’s company, you alone scorned my invitation. You told your Captain that we, people of Northern Luzon are infidels, and that it would be against the prophets law for you, a holy man, to eat our food.”
“You behold about me, seated around my throne, the elderly ladies who are my counselors. Do their chairs of sandal-wood, does my silk canopied and gold plated throne, suggest the court of a barbarous people?”
“I greeted you with the usual salutations of courtesy in the Turkish tongue, and had one of my attendants fetch ink and paper so I could write for you in Arabic characters that you recognized as the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Are such tokens of culture common among barbarians?”
When my father Dalisay, the aged king by whose name you call his kingdom, was a much younger man, there visited here a priest of another faith from far distant Europe. But he did not shun novelty in food as you do. The sago trees that produce flour, interest him, he admired the sugar-giving buri palms, and liked our coconut wine. And I hope you will appreciate the cordial pickles and preserves which, with some other gifts for your acceptance in remembrance of the land of Dalisay, I have had sent to your ship.”

I feel that I'm never alone for there is always somebody bothering me. One day, my family planned a picnic together with my aunties, uncles and cousins. I thought it would be a nice chance to spend some time with my friends so I made an alibi 1 told them i will just stay home and do my homework instead of going to the picnic. My parents were about to cancel the plan but somehow I managed to make them leave. Finally, after a long time I was alone at home. I felt good and excited so I started calling my friends to see who's free for an outing. After around five calls, I came upon Jessa who was free for the day. The rest of them were out with their families. We both decided to go to a nearby pool. We picked our motorcycles and set off. As luck would have it, I met an accident on the way. One moment I was in terrible pain and the next thing I remembered I fainted. When I opened my eyes, I was in a hospital with a fractured leg and bandages here and there. Jessa was not badly hurt so she called my parents and informed them about the accident, I was now at home in bed. I knew everybody was angry because I lied to them. My mother asked about the homework but my father told her to keep quiet for some time. From that day on, I saw a different kind of family Mother cooked for me whatever I wanted and made sure that I take my medicines. My father brought me books to keep me busy. My brother would do whatever favor I ask from him. During weekends my aunties and uncles brought me flowers and gifts. My other cousins told me jokes and stories to keep me in a good humor. Two months had passed like this, I didn't feel bored or like a handicap even for a single day. It was then I realized the importance of family. None of my friends were here to support me. I can't imagine what would have happened to me if I was alone. I apologize to my parents for lying. My mother kissed me in the forehead and said, "It's okay, I know you have learnt your lesson." I thank God for giving me such a loving family. I love my family so much that I can't live without them.

________1. Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol’s
most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in
pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not manmade. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the
construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at
the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that
the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty.

________2. The crocodile and the alligator are cousins. They both live in water and
on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a
narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The
crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat
turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any
kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer.
_________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They
are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The
three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are
clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A
few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds
called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat,
sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus
clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the
house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring
an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.

________1. Looking like giant mole hills, the Chocolate Hills are probably Bohol’s
most famous tourist attraction. Most people who first see the landscape in
pictures can hardly believe that these hills are natural artifact or not manmade. If this idea is true, then the effort of building them surely surpasses the
construction of the pyramids in Egypt. They are covered with grass, which at
the end of the dry season, turns into chocolate brown. It is from this color that
the name Chocolate Hills was derived. Be amazed with its beauty.
Book now and travel to Bohol with your family!
________2. The crocodile and the alligator are cousins. They both live in water and
on land. They almost look alike but with a little difference. The crocodile has a
narrower head. Its mouth is more pointed than the mouth of the alligator. The
crocodile is quicker and more dangerous than the alligator. Both animals eat
turtles, fish and other water animals. When grown up, they will eat almost any
kind of land or water animal up to the size of a deer.
_________3. Clouds are collections of millions of water droplets or ice crystals. They
are formed high above the Earth’s surface and sometimes at ground level. The
three main forms of clouds are cumulus, stratus, and cirrus. Their shapes are
clues to predicting weather. Cumulus clouds are puffy, with broad, flat bases. A
few small cumulus clouds signal fair weather. But tall, bulky cumulus clouds
called cumulonimbus can produce thunderstorms. Stratus clouds are flat,
sheetlike clouds They normally mean warm or possibly wet weather. Cirrus
clouds are wispy clouds found at great heights. So, the next time you leave the
house, look up the sky, observe the clouds, and find out whether you will bring
an umbrella or pack up a raincoat.

Read the excerpt “The Training of a Knight” and take note its strengths and weaknesses on how it was written by the writer. The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!"

What makes an effective leader? To be sure, no one characteristic or trait defines an effective leader. It is true, however, that effective leaders get the most out of employees or group members by holding them to very high standards or expectations. Setting high standards increases productivity because people tend to live up to the expectations set for them by superiors. This is an example of the Pygmalion effect, which works in a subtle,
often unconscious way. When a managerial leader believes that a group member will succeed, the manager communicates this belief without realizing that he or she is doing so. Conversely, when a leader expects a group member to fail, that person will not usually disappoint the manager. The manager’s expectation of success or failure becomes a self fulfilling prophecy. Thus it pays for a manager to expect the best from employees. 
(Adaptedfrom Andrew J. DuBrin, Leadership 4/e, © Cengage Learning.)

B. People are likely to live up to a manager's or superior's expectations

Those cuddly stuffed animals called teddy bears seem to have been around forever. But actually the first teddy bears came into being when President Theodore “Teddy” Roosevelt showed himself too much of a sportsman to shoot a staked bear cub. In 1902, Roosevelt visited Mississippi to settle a border dispute. In Roosevelt’s honor, his hosts organized a hunting expedition. To make sure that the president would bag a trophy, they staked a bear
cub to the ground so that Roosevelt’s shot couldn’t miss. To his credit, Roosevelt refused to shoot the bear. When the incident was publicized, largely through political cartoons, a Russian candy store owner named Morris Michtom made a toy bear out of soft, fuzzy cloth and placed it in his shop window with a sign reading “Teddy’s Bear.” The bear was a hit with passersby, and teddy-bear mania spread rapidly throughout the country. Soon, Teddy's bear was the country's most popular toy, the teddy bear.
_____15. What is the main idea of this passage?
A. In 1902, Roosevelt went to Mississippi and was the guest of honor at a hunting expedition
B. The name “Teddy Bear” is derived from President Theodore Roosevelt
C. After story got publicity via political cartoons, candy store owner created Teddy's bear

He begs for water, but no one answers his pleas until La Esmerelda comes forth and brings him something to drink. Nearby, a recluse called Sister Gudule, screams at La Esmerelda for being a "gypsy child- thief" and blames her for her daughter's kidnapping fifteen years earlier. A few months later, La Esmerelda is dancing in front of Notre Dame and Phoebus calls her over to him. She has fallen in love with him and blushes when he asks her to meet him later that night. Frollo watches them from the top of Notre Dame and becomes insanely jealous of Phoebus. His obsessive lust for La Esmerelda has made him renounce God and study alchemy and black magic. In his secret cell at Notre Dame, he plans to trap La Esmerelda like a spider catching a fly with its web. Later that night, he follows Phoebus to his tryst with La Esmerelda and stabs Phoebus repeatedly. He escapes and La Esmerelda is captured by the King's guard. After being tortured at her trial, La Esmerelda falsely confesses to killingPhoebus and being a witch. She is sentenced to hang in the Place de Grève. Frollo visits her in jail and declares his love. He begs her to love him and show him some pity but she calls him a "goblin-monk" and a murderer, refusing to have anything to do with him. Before her execution, La Esmerelda is publicly humiliated in front of Notre Dame. Looking across the square, she suddenly sees Phoebus and calls out his name. He actually survived the murder attempt but doesn't want anyone to know that he was injured. He turns away from La Esmerelda and enters the house of his brideto-be. Just then, Quasimodo swings down on a rope from Notre Dame and carries her back to the cathedral, crying out "Sanctuary!" He had fallen in love with her when she brought him water and had been planning her escape all along. La Esmerelda is safe from execution just as long as she stays inside thecathedral. At first, she finds it hard to even look at Quasimodo, but they form an uneasy friendship. Even though he is deaf, he enjoys being around her when she sings. Meanwhile, a group of vagabonds resolves to save La Esmerelda after hearing that Parliament has ordered that she will be removed from Notre Dame. But when Quasimodo sees them attack the cathedral, he thinks they have come to kill La Esmerelda and he fend them off as best he can, killing a large number of them. Frollo has used the attack as a diversion to sneak La Esmerelda out of the cathedral. He offers her two choices: she can either say she loves him or be hanged. She demands to be executed and he leaves her with Sister Gudule. To their astonishment, they discover that they are mother and daughter. Gudule tries to protect La Esmerelda, but it is too late. Back at Notre Dame, Quasimodo goes to the top of the north tower to find her. Gazing off into the distance, he sees the figure of La Esmerelda in a white dress hanging from the scaffold. He bellows out in despair and grabs Frollo by the neck. Holding him up in the air, Quasimodo sighs with grief and then throws Frollo down to his death. Looking at La Esmerelda hanging off in the distance and Frollo's wrangled corpse down below, Quasimodo cries out: "There is everything I ever loved!" Quasimodo is never seen again. Years later when a gravedigger stumbles across La Esmerelda's remains, he finds the skeleton of a hunchback curled around her. (https://www.sparknotes.com/lit/hunchback/summary/Guide Questions:1.

The Training of a KnightExcerpts from The Age of Chivalry or Legendsof King Arthur by Thomas Bulfinch (1858)The preparatory education of candidates for knighthood was long and arduous. At seven years of age the noble children were usually removed from their father's house to the court or castle of their future patron, and placed under the care of a governor, who taught them the first articles of religion, and respect and reverence for their lords and superiors, and initiated them in the ceremonies of a court. They were called pages, valets or varlets, and their office was to carve, to wait at table, and to perform other menial services which were not then considered humiliating. In their leisure hours they learned to dance and play on the harp, were instructed in the mysteries of woods and rivers, that is, in hunting, falconry, and fishing, and in wrestling, tilting with spears, and performing other military exercises on horseback. At fourteen the page became an esquire, and began a course of severer and more laborious exercises. To vault on a horse in heavy armor; to run, to scale walls, and spring over ditches, under the same encumbrance; to wrestle, to wield the battle-axe for a length of time, without raising the visor or taking breath; to perform with grace all the evolutions of horsemanship,- were necessary preliminaries to the reception of knighthood, which was usually conferred at twenty-one years of age, when the young man's education was supposed to be completed. In the meantime, the esquires were no less assiduously engaged in acquiring all those refinements of civility which formed what was in that age called courtesy. The same castle in which they received their education was usually thronged with young persons of the other sex, and the page was encouraged, at a very early age, to select some lady of the court as the mistress of his heart, to whom he was taught to refer all his sentiments, words, and actions. The service of his mistress was the glory and occupation of a knight, and her smiles, bestowed at once by affection and gratitude, were held out as the recompense of his well-directed valor. Religion united its influence with those of loyalty and love, and the order of knighthood, endowed with all the sanctity and religious awe that attended the priesthood, became an object of ambition to the greatest sovereigns. The ceremonies of initiation were peculiarly solemn. After undergoing a severe fast, and spending whole nights in prayer, the candidate confessed, and received the sacrament. He then clothed himself in snow-white garments, and repaired to the church, or the hall, where the ceremony was to take place, bearing a knightly sword suspended from his neck, which the officiating priest took and blessed, and then returned to him. The candidate then, with folded arms, knelt before the presiding knight, who, after some questions about his motives and purposes in requesting admission, administered to him the oaths, and granted his request. Some of the knights present, sometimes even ladies and damsels, handed to him in succession the spurs, the coat of mail, the hauberk, the armlet and gauntlet, and lastly he girded on the sword. He then knelt again before the president, who, rising from his seat, gave him the "accolade," which consisted of three strokes, with the flat of a sword, on the shoulder or neck of the candidate, accompanied by the words: "In the name of God, of St. Michael, and St. George, I make thee a knight; be valiant, courteous, and loyal!" Then he received his helmet, his shield, and spear; and thus the investiture ended.​</h2><br />

                            16. GRADE 9- READING ACTIVITY WEEK 7 MACBETH A year or two before Edward the Confessor began to rule England: a battle was won in Scotland against a Norwegian King by two generals named Macbeth and Banquo. After the battle, the generals walked together towards Forres, in Elginshire, where Ouncan, King of Scotland was awaiting them. While they were crossing a lonely heath, they saw three women withered in appearance and wild in attire. “Hail. Macbeth, chieftain of Glamis.” said the first woman. “Hail. Macbeth, chieftain of Cawdor.” said the second woman. “Hail. Macbeth, King that is to be.” said the third woman. Then Banquo asked, “What of me?” and the third woman replied. “Thou shalt be the father of kings.” Banquo and Macbeth knew then that they had been addressed by witches and were discussing their prophecies. “The third witch called me, ‘King that is to be.’ “Banquo,” he said, ‘you see that the witches spoke truth concerning me. Do you not believe that your child and grandchild will be kings?” Banquo frowned. Macbeth thought the prophecy that he should be King too pleasant to keep to himself and he mentioned it to his wife in a letter. When Lady Macbeth. read his letter, she was determined that he should be King. When a messenger arrived to inform her that Duncan would pass a night in Macbeth’s castle. She told Macbeth as she saw him that Duncan must spend a sunless morrow. She meant that Duncan must die. After supper Duncan went to bed, and two grooms were placed on guard at his bedroom door. Lady Macbeth caused them to drink wine till they were stupefied. Macbeth came and found the daggers lying by the grooms; and soon with red hands appeared before his wile. The murderers heard a knocking. It was Macduff, the chieftain of Fife. Macbeth showed him the door of the King's room. Macduff entered, and came out again crying, "O horror!” Macbeth appeared as horror-stricken as Macduff and he slew the two grooms with their own daggers. Macbeth was crowned at Scone. Macbeth was King. Questions: 1. Who are the characters in the story? Write down their characterization. 2. What did the second woman say to Macbeth? 3. Who were addressing Macbeth and Banquo according to their prophecies? 4. What is the meaning of ‘sunless morrow’? 5. Who was crowned as the king at Scone? ​</h2><br />

                            17. With the rise and prominence of the Shri-Visayan Empire in the 6th to the 13th centuries, political dominance by conquests and wars took place. By the series of wars , the men population was depleted. In the course of time, the women folks by necessity in the scarcity of available men, had to take the place of the men in the battlefield so that they came to develop the high art of warfare to preserve their political state.
About seven hundred years ago, when Pangasinan was a kingdom, there lived a famous woman ruler in that dominion. Young, beautiful and well-educated, Princess Urduja was reputed to be a good warrior who had personally led her soldiers to the battlefields. Her retinue consisted of women skilled in arms, in riding horses and with well-built and well-developed bodies, prodigious strengh and masculine physique dubbed as Kinalakian or Kalakian or Amazon.
To the Pangasinan court many a suitor came, seeking for the hand of fair Urduja. The Princess said to them, “I will marry only the man who can defeat me. My husband must be braver , stronger, and wiser than myself.” As no one qualified to her demands, she remained unmarried all her life. For no one wished to be beaten by a woman. When her mother died, she became the ruler of Pangasinan region. Her bravery and skill were known far and near. She ruled her people well and wisely. Like the famous Amazons of old, Princess Urduja was not only intelligent, beautiful, and dominant, but also the very personification of kindness and virtue. One of her policies was to introduce the best of other countries adapted to her own. She was a woman who was interested in foreign affairs for the good of her own kingdom. She liked to hear the tales about India, the Pepper Country.An Arab traveller, Ibn Batuta, on his way to china, stopped at her kingdom. According to her custom, she invited the ship’s crew to a banquet. The Arab refused to go because he could not eat their food since they were “infidels”. The princess was offended and summoned him. He was surprised at what his eyes witnessed and his ears heard. For the Princess was robed in her richest and best, decked with precious stones and surrounded by brave and loyal men and women. She talked to the visitor in Arabian. This alone proved that she was a Moslem, knew her Koran, and therefore knew Arabic, she told him: “You, Priest, I have had you brought here by my guards because, of all of your ship’s company, you alone scorned my invitation. You told your Captain that we, people of Northern Luzon are infidels, and that it would be against the prophets law for you, a holy man, to eat our food.”
“You behold about me, seated around my throne, the elderly ladies who are my counselors. Do their chairs of sandal-wood, does my silk canopied and gold plated throne, suggest the court of a barbarous people?”
“I greeted you with the usual salutations of courtesy in the Turkish tongue, and had one of my attendants fetch ink and paper so I could write for you in Arabic characters that you recognized as the name of the merciful and compassionate God. Are such tokens of culture common among barbarians?”
When my father Dalisay, the aged king by whose name you call his kingdom, was a much younger man, there visited here a priest of another faith from far distant Europe. But he did not shun novelty in food as you do. The sago trees that produce flour, interest him, he admired the sugar-giving buri palms, and liked our coconut wine. And I hope you will appreciate the cordial pickles and preserves which, with some other gifts for your acceptance in remembrance of the land of Dalisay, I have had sent to your ship.”
