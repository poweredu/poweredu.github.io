strengths and weaknesses of qualitative research;</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Qualitative research is a research method that seeks to understand the complexity of human experiences, behaviors, and social interactions. It is often used to explore and describe social phenomena that are difficult to quantify or measure. Here are some of the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of qualitative research:</p><p></p><p>Characteristics:</p><p></p><p>It is subjective and interpretive, meaning that the researcher's own experiences and beliefs may influence the interpretation of the data.</p><p>It focuses on rich and detailed data that are often gathered through interviews, observations, and other qualitative methods.</p><p>It aims to understand the meanings and interpretations that people give to their experiences, behaviors, and social interactions.</p><p>It often uses open-ended questions and flexible methods to allow participants to share their experiences in their own words.</p><p>It is iterative, meaning that the researcher often revisits the data to refine their understanding of the phenomenon being studied.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p></p><p>It can provide rich and detailed insights into complex social phenomena that cannot be captured by quantitative methods alone.</p><p>It can help to generate new theories or hypotheses that can be tested through further research.</p><p>It allows for flexibility in data collection and analysis, which can be especially useful in exploratory research.</p><p>It can provide a more holistic understanding of the phenomenon being studied by exploring the experiences and perspectives of different individuals and groups.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p></p><p>It can be time-consuming and resource-intensive to collect and analyze data.</p><p>It may be subject to researcher bias or interpretation, which can limit the objectivity of the findings.</p><p>It may be difficult to generalize findings to larger populations, as the sample size is often small and non-representative.</p><p>It may be difficult to ensure the reliability and validity of the findings, especially if the researcher is not adequately trained in qualitative methods</p>Qualitative research is a type of research that is focused on exploring and understanding human behavior, attitudes, and experiences through the collection and analysis of non-numerical data. The following are some characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of qualitative research:<br /><br />Characteristics:<br /><br />1. Subjective: Qualitative research is subjective in nature, as it is based on the interpretation of data by the researcher.<br /><br />2. Inductive: Qualitative research is often inductive, which means that it starts from the specific and moves to the general.<br /><br />3. Flexible: Qualitative research is flexible in terms of the methods and techniques used to collect and analyze data.<br /><br />4. Contextual: Qualitative research is contextual, as it is focused on understanding the social and cultural context in which the research is being conducted.<br /><br />Strengths:<br /><br />1. In-depth understanding: Qualitative research provides an in-depth understanding of the phenomena being studied, as it focuses on the experiences and perspectives of the participants.<br /><br />2. Flexibility: Qualitative research is flexible in terms of the methods and techniques used, which allows researchers to adapt to the specific needs of the study.<br /><br />3. Rich data: Qualitative research generates rich and detailed data that can provide insights into complex phenomena.<br /><br />4. Validity: Qualitative research can provide a high level of validity, as it is focused on understanding the experiences and perspectives of the participants.<br /><br />Weaknesses:<br /><br />1. Limited generalizability: Qualitative research is often limited in terms of generalizability, as it is based on a small sample size and may not be representative of the larger population.<br /><br />2. Time-consuming: Qualitative research can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, as it often involves lengthy data collection and analysis processes.<br /><br />3. Subjectivity: Qualitative research is subjective in nature, which may lead to bias or researcher interpretation.<br /><br />4. Lack of standardization: Qualitative research lacks standardization in terms of methods and techniques, which can make it difficult to compare results across studies.<br />

                            2. What are the characteristics, strengths and weaknesses and kinds of qualitative research?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Characteristics of Qualitative Research</strong></p><p></p><p>According to Bogdan and Biklen, as cited in Fraenkel and Wallen (2006), the characteristics of qualitative research are as follows:</p><p></p><p>The direct source of data is the natural setting and the researcher is the key instrument in qualitative research. Researchers go directly to the particular setting of interest to observe and collect the needed data.</p><p>Data collected are in the form of words or illustrations rather than numbers. The kinds of data collected may include, but not limited to, audio recordings, diaries, field notes, memorandums, official records, personal comments, photographs, textbook passages, transcripts of interview, videotapes, and anything else that convey actual words or actions of people.</p><p>Qualitative research is concerned with process as well as product. The primary interest of a qualitative researcher is on how things happen and on people’s interaction with one another.</p><p>Analysis of data is taken inductively. It starts with the specific concepts of the respondents to draw out general idea or theory. To do this, a considerable amount of time is spent in collecting data before the important questions are considered.</p><p>Qualitative research deals with how people make sense out of their lives. The perspective of the subjects of a study is a major concern.</p><p></p><p><strong>Strengths and Weaknesses of Qualitative Research</strong></p><p>What are the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative research?</p><p></p><p>Many researchers become more interested in qualitative research because of its nature and perceived strengths. Basically, the strength of qualitative research is its capacity to give rich information about the respondents, may it be humans or animals. In addition, the following are the strengths of qualitative research:</p><p></p><p>provides in-depth information on individual cases;</p><p>unravels complex phenomena embedded in local context;</p><p>describes rich phenomena situated in some exceptional environments;</p><p>relays subjects’ experiences and perspectives in unusual details;</p><p>conveys setting factors related to the situation of interest;</p><p>allows flexibility in research-related processes;</p><p>enables data to be collected in natural setting;</p><p>determines possible causes of a particular event in another perspective as that given by quantitative research;</p><p>permits approaches that are responsive to local conditions and stakeholders’ needs;</p><p>presents several options in the conduct of the research;</p><p>tolerates shifts in focus based on research results; and</p><p>accepts unstructured interpretation of the participants, respecting anything that is in the participants’ context.</p><p>Despite its strengths, qualitative research has a number of perceived weaknesses. These weaknesses, however, are just the in applicability of the qualitative approach to some research objectives. The following are weaknesses of qualitative research:</p><p></p><p>Data gathering is often time-consuming.</p><p>Analysis of data takes longer time than that in quantitative analysis.</p><p>Interpretation of results is usually biased because it is influenced by the researcher’s perspective.</p><p>Conclusions are not generalizable because the subjects are few and sometimes possess unique characteristics compared to typical respondents.</p><br />

                            6. CAN YOU RECOGNIZE THE NATURE OF QUALITATIVE RESEARCH ITS KINDS CHARACTERISTICS STRENGTHS AND WEAKNESS</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The characteristics of qualitative research are as follows:
</p><p>1. In qualitative research, the natural environment is the primary source of evidence, and the researcher is the primary tool. Researchers go straight to the site of interest to observe and gather the necessary data.
</p><p>
</p><p>2. Data is obtained in the form of words or diagrams rather than numbers. Data obtained may include, but is not limited to, audio files, diaries, field notes, memorandums, official documents, personal statements, photographs, textbook passages, interview transcripts, videotapes, and everything else that conveys actual words or acts of individuals.
</p><p>
</p><p>3. Qualitative research is concerned with both method and product. A qualitative researcher's main focus is on how things work and how people communicate with one another.
</p><p>
</p><p>4.  Data analysis is done inductively. It begins with the respondents' individual ideas in order to derive a general idea or hypothesis. To do this, a significant amount of time is spent gathering data before considering the relevant questions.
</p><p>
</p><p>5. Qualitative research is concerned with how people make sense of their lives. The point of view of the subjects of an analysis is crucial.
</p><p>
</p><p>What are the strengths and weaknesses of qualitative research?
</p><p>Because of the essence and potential strengths of qualitative research, more scholars are becoming more interested in it. Essentially, the value of qualitative analysis is the ability to include detailed information for respondents, whether humans or animals. Furthermore, qualitative research has the following advantages:
</p><p>relates subjects' views and points of view in unusual detail;  
</p><p>conveys setting factors relevant to the case under consideration;  
</p><p>allows for greater transparency in research-related processes;  
</p><p>allows for data collection in a natural setting;  
</p><p>identifies potential triggers of a specific case from a different viewpoint than quantitative research;  
</p><p>allows for interventions that are sensitive to local circumstances and the interests of stakeholders;  
</p><p>provides many opportunities for conducting the study; • allows for changes in emphasis based on research findings; and  
</p><p>recognizes unstructured analysis of the participants while respecting something in the sense of the participants</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Strengths and weaknesses</p><p>Strengths of qualitative research</p><p>Qualitative methods tend to collect very rich data in an efficient manner: rather than being limited to the responders to a set of pre-defined questions, it is possible to explore interesting concepts that can lead to novel theory by analysing the entirety of a participant’s interview/story/interaction.</p><p>Qualitative methods can lead to the generation of new theory from unexpected findings that go against “conventional” public health understanding</p><p>When combined with quantitative methods, qualitative research can provide a much more complete picture. For example, a well-designed process evaluation of a trial may provide important insights into participant attitudes, beliefs, and thoughts about the intervention and its acceptability, which may not be evident from the quantitative outcome evaluation.</p><p>Weaknesses of qualitative research</p><p>It is important that qualitative researchers adhere to robust methodology in order to ensure high quality research. Poor quality qualitative work can lead to misleading findings.</p><p>Qualitative research alone is often insufficient to make population-level summaries. The research is not designed for this purpose, as the aim is not to generate summaries generalisable to the wider population.</p><p>Policy makers may not understand or value the interpretive position and therefore may not recognize the importance of qualitative research.</p><p>Qualitative research can be time and labour-intensive. Conducting multiple interviews and focus groups can be logistically difficult to arrange and time consuming. Furthermore, tranalysanscription and analysis of the data (comparing, coding, and inducting) requires intense concentration and full immersion in the data – a process that can be far more time-consuming than a descriptive statistical analysis.</p><br />

                            22. weakness and strength of qualitative and quantitative research​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Both qualitative and quantitative methods of user research play important roles in product development. Data from quantitative research—such as market size, demographics, and user preferences—provides important information for business decisions. Qualitative research provides valuable data for use in the design of a product—including data about user needs, behavior patterns, and use cases. Each of these approaches has strengths and weaknesses, and each can benefit from our combining them with one another. This month, we’ll take a look at these two approaches to user research and discuss how and when to apply them.
</p><p>
</p><p>Quantitative Studies
</p><p>Statistical analysis lets us derive important facts from research data, including preference trends, differences between groups, and demographics.
</p><p>Quantitative studies provide data that can be expressed in numbers—thus, their name. Because the data is in a numeric form, we can apply statistical tests in making statements about the data. These include descriptive statistics like the mean, median, and standard deviation, but can also include inferential statistics like t-tests, ANOVAs, or multiple regression correlations (MRC). Statistical analysis lets us derive important facts from research data, including preference trends, differences between groups, and demographics.
</p><p>
</p><p>Multivariate statistics like the MRC or stepwise correlation regression break the data down even further and determine what factors—such as variances in preferences—we can attribute to differences between specific groups such as age groups. Quantitative studies often employ automated means of collecting data such as surveys, but we can also use other static methods—for example, examining preferences through two-alternative, forced-choice studies or examining error rates and time on task using competitive benchmarks.
</p><p>
</p><p>Quantitative studies’ great strength is providing data that is descriptive—for example, allowing us to capture a snapshot of a user population—but we encounter difficulties when it comes to their interpretation. For example, Gallup polls commonly provide data about approval rates for the President of the United States, as shown in Figure 1, but don’t provide the crucial information that we would need to interpret that data.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

Contact Time:</p><p></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Qualitative research allows researchers to spend more time with participants, resulting in the collection of more comprehensive data.</p><p>- It builds trust and rapport between the researcher and participant, leading to more full and honest responses.</p><p>- Interaction and engagement with participants can provide a deeper understanding of their experiences.</p><p></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- Recruiting and engaging participants can be time-consuming and difficult to coordinate.</p><p>- Researchers may need to balance the demands of research with other responsibilities, resulting in limited contact time.</p><p>- Spending more time with participants can result in more subjective data interpretation due to familiarity between the researcher and participant.</p><p></p><p>3. Data Gathering:</p><p></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Qualitative research can use a variety of data-gathering techniques, such as interviews, focus groups, and observation, to collect rich and varied data.</p><p>- Researchers can explore complex and nuanced data that are difficult to capture using quantitative data-gathering methods.</p><p>- Researcher presence is often supported, and participant feedback can be collected immediately, allowing for clarification and elaboration of data.</p><p></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- Qualitative research is often labor-intensive and can require extensive note-taking and transcription of data.</p><p>- Collecting and analyzing qualitative data can be subjective and open to interpretation, leading to potential bias.</p><p>- Data analysis often takes longer, and the reporting of results can be subject to the researchers' interpretation.</p><p></p><p>4. Flexibility</p><p></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Qualitative research allows for flexibility in the research inquiry, research design, and data collection.</p><p>- It allows for the inclusion of unanticipated data and observations that the researcher may not have predicted.</p><p>- Researchers can take advantage of the emergent nature of the research, allowing for a more dynamic and open research process.</p><p></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- Flexibility can also cause problems with data analysis, mainly because data analysis has to deal with complex and highly personalized data.</p><p>- Emergent data and unexpected observations may not always fit within the research design, leading to difficulty in data analysis and data-coding.</p><p></p><p>5. Ethics:</p><p></p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- Qualitative research can provide a transformative impact on society; researchers can leverage qualitative research to highlight inequalities, oppression, and marginalization.</p><p>- Ethical considerations related to protecting the confidentiality and privacy of participants' data are highly emphasized.</p><p>- With more extended contact time, researchers have a more significant duty of care towards their subjects and are encouraged to establish trust and rapport with them.</p><p></p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- Ethical considerations could delay or hinder the research, potentially resulting in the exclusion of participants due to personal/family/employment issues.</p><p>- Researchers working with vulnerable or marginalized populations must adhere to strict ethical frameworks that reflect broader societal expectations, ethical concerns, cultural considerations, and legal obligations.</p><p>- Ethical considerations may lead to researchers having to use self-censorship while experimenting as information that is relevant and in the public interest may be too sensitive for the participants and already established norms.</p><p></p><br />

It starts from the respondents’ perspectives, expressions, and activities in their local context. In this case, qualitative research is important across many fields of inquiry because it is designed for social sciences, psychology, and other fields. With this, qualitative research would verify or validate the tendencies, transform it into research programs, and maintain the necessary changes toward its objectives and tasks.</p><p></p><p>For example, qualitative research can be employed in health care research. One may study people’s experiences of and access to health care. Various perspectives of patients and professionals can be understood using qualitative research. An individual’s experiences, attitudes, and circumstances in life that affect his/her health needs and behavior can likewise be studied.</p><p>Explanation:</p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>Strengths of qualitative research</strong></p><p></p><p>•Qualitative methods tend to collect very rich data in an efficient manner: rather than being limited to the responders to a set of pre-defined questions, it is possible to explore interesting concepts that can lead to novel theory by analysing the entirety of a participant’s interview/story/interaction.</p><p></p><p>•Qualitative methods can lead to the generation of new theory from unexpected findings that go against “conventional” public health understanding</p><p></p><p>•When combined with quantitative methods, qualitative research can provide a much more complete picture. For example, a well-designed process evaluation of a trial may provide important insights into participant attitudes, beliefs, and thoughts about the intervention and its acceptability, which may not be evident from the quantitative outcome evaluation.</p><p></p><p><strong>Weaknesses of qualitative research</strong></p><p></p><p>•It is important that qualitative researchers adhere to robust methodology in order to ensure high quality research. Poor quality qualitative work can lead to misleading findings.</p><p></p><p>•Qualitative research alone is often insufficient to make population-level summaries. The research is not designed for this purpose, as the aim is not to generate summaries generalisable to the wider population.</p><p></p><p>•Policy makers may not understand or value the interpretive position and therefore may not recognize the importance of qualitative research.</p><p></p><p>•Qualitative research can be time and labour-intensive. Conducting multiple interviews and focus groups can be logistically difficult to arrange and time consuming. Furthermore, tranalysanscription and analysis of the data (comparing, coding, and inducting) requires intense concentration and full immersion in the data – a process that can be far more time-consuming than a descriptive statistical analysis.</p><p></p><p> </p><p></p><p></p><p></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>strength</p><p></p><p>Quantitative data provides a macro view with all the required details and comparatively larger samples.
