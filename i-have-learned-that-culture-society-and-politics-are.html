By the middle of 18th century, capitalism had begun to outgrow its early state and gradually it became the dominant socio-economic system in western and northern Europe. 5.

                                            How can you use your knowledge and understanding in culture society and politics in responding to different societal issues​?Answer: I can use it by sharing it to others for them to be aware of what their going to do if ever social issues come like when you migrate to other country there's possibility that discrimination is present and you have to know how to handle such kind if issue for you to overcome it, first you must understand that there's a lot of people like that and maybe that's their culture or it's just normal for them but you have also to know how to fight back justly and don't let them feel that they're higher than you cuz in the first place we are all humans. Another example is, when you have plan to visit such place for vacation you must know first their culture for you to know what to do and not to do, like when you come to North Korea, you must prepare your self of the culture they have and you must also learn that their culture is further different from yours so you must be extra careful of what you're going to do there. </a>

The importance of culture in society is as a tradition, noble values, and local wisdom that are shared from generation to generation by a community in a nation. Culture Can be interpreted as a collective identity or the identity of a nation. <strong>Society and culture cannot be separated</strong> because society is a container of culture itself. So that humans give birth to a culture that is considered as living values ​​for society.</p><p>The relationship between <strong>politics and society</strong> is very close because people make up a political system . The political system is a subsystem of the social system. The system perspective or approach sees the interactions that exist in a system, namely a unit that is relatively separate from its environment and has a relatively fixed relationship between its constituent elements.</p><p><strong>Political culture is a pattern</strong> of behavior of a society in the life of the state, the implementation of state administration, government politics, law, customary norms that are lived by all members of society every day.

                            23. How can you use your knowledge and understanding in culture society and politics in responding to different societal issues​?Answer: I can use it by sharing it to others for them to be aware of what their going to do if ever social issues come like when you migrate to other country there's possibility that discrimination is present and you have to know how to handle such kind if issue for you to overcome it, first you must understand that there's a lot of people like that and maybe that's their culture or it's just normal for them but you have also to know how to fight back justly and don't let them feel that they're higher than you cuz in the first place we are all humans. Another example is, when you have plan to visit such place for vacation you must know first their culture for you to know what to do and not to do, like when you come to North Korea, you must prepare your self of the culture they have and you must also learn that their culture is further different from yours so you must be extra careful of what you're going to do there. </h2><br />
