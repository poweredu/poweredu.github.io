Cause and Effect 
Description

Sequence/Order
Compare and Contrast
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</a>

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p><strong>ABOUT </strong><strong>CIGARETTES</strong></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>1</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>About 23 percent of all adults are smokers. This fact seems dwarfed when you hear that 30 percent of adolescents use some sort of tobacco. In fact, statistics show that the average age for first using tobacco is 13. This means that the majority of all tobacco users started when they were a teenager. The effects of smoking are common and dangerous but what most people don't realize, secondhand and thirdhand smoking is just as bad. Authority figures need to set up limitations for tobacco use and combat young age smoking.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>2</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>A few dangerous diseases one could get by using tobacco include: coronary heart disease, lung, oral, throat, kidney, and pancreatic cancer, and even COPD. The list goes on and on and most of them can leave a person scared for life. Smoking is unacceptable in general, but doing it while pregnant is even worse. Just under eleven percent of all pregnant women smoke. Using tobacco while pregnant accounts for ten percent of all infant deaths. Smoking is obviously terrible. All of these facts plainly support that simple statement.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>3</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Certain places are making it illegal to smoke around other people. The Grand Island City code prohibits smoking in public places. Why not outlaw all smoking except for certain designated places. This would limit the amount of exposure nonsmoking individuals receive. It would allow families to safely take a walk through a park without encountering any disease filled smoke clouds.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>4</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p><strong>The effects of smoking are widespread and can be deadly. The issues one could get by using tobacco should turn anyone away from the idea. Yet, it still happens. Youth still have a high probability of trying some sort of tobacco use and when they live in an environment where secondhand smoke is constant, it makes it that much worse. Like stated above, an apartment building would be the perfect example for showing the dangers of second and thirdhand smoke. If one person smokes, the whole building smokes. This phrase clearly states that when one persons decides to give in to the addiction known as cigarettes, the whole building and the surrounding area are affected to.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>(</strong><strong>5</strong><strong>)</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>By quitting smoking, you can: Lengthen your life expectancy. Decrease your risk of disease (including lung cancer, throat cancer, emphysema, heart disease, high blood pressure, ulcers and reflux, erectile and sexual dysfunction, kidney disease, and other conditions)</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Research conducted among smokers has shown that cigarette smoking (or nicotine administration) has several benefits, including modest improvements in vigilance and information processing, facilitation of some motor responses, and perhaps enhancement of memory131"133.</strong><strong>Smoking causes cancer, heart disease, stroke, lung diseases, diabetes, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), which includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Smoking also increases risk for tuberculosis, certain eye diseases, and problems of the immune system, including rheumatoid arthritis.</strong></p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>pick your choice hope it helps :)</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>3.Do young peoples behavior better or worse than it was years ago?</p><p></p><p>Teenager's behavior has without a doubt gotten worse over the years. Teenagers nowadays are likely to be more exposed to the bad things that happen in this world. Generally during the teen years, thoughts about bodies, opposite sex and sexuality come into mind. </p><p></p><p>The teenage years are a time to experiment, explore and take risks. In the time of teenage years, emotions and feelings also become more noticeable to them. It is a time when one begins to search them and find out who they are and what their personality is it is a time to define one’s self as an individual. Over the decades, there has been a drastic change in teen behavior. Some of these changes include sexual activity, violence, alcohols and drug abuse. This change often puzzles people and they wonder how it happened. My stand in this question is yes, teenage behavior has worsened over the years. </p><p></p><p>Teenage behaviors are worse than it was years ago because they like to involve in negative social activities, crimes and tend to be a rebellious.</p><p>One of the reasons that can prove teenagers behaviours nowadays are more worse than years ago is teenagers nowadays like to involve in negative social activities. </p><p></p><p>Teenagers nowadays involves in many problems such as becoming addicted to smoke, alcohol and drug. As we can see, majority of the teenager nowadays addicted to smoke and alcohol, it is because teens may be faced with peers who smoke or family members who...middle of paper. They will care the feeling of their peers and did not want their peers disappointed or get throw away from peer’s group. Want to or not, teenagers will follow their negative peer activities, examples like smoking, taking drugs, and joining gangs. Although teenagers did not want to do it, they will try it at once because of the peer pressure from their friends.</p><p></p><p>It is proven that the teenager’s behavior is becoming worse than it was years ago. As we can see, many teenagers are more likely to involve in many issues negative social activities, crimes and tend to be a rebellious. It can destroy teenager’s future and bring harms to them. Although there are many reasons that can lead teenager to becoming worse, actually the most important matter is in teenagers themselves.</p><br />

Cause and Effect 
Description
Problem and Solution
Sequence/Order
Compare and Contrast
1. All matter, all things can be changed in two ways: chemically and physically. Both chemical and physical changes affect the state of matter. Physical changes are those that do not change the make-up or identity of the matter. For example, clay will bend or flatten if squeezed, but it will still be clay. Changing the shape of clay is a physical change, and does not change the matter’s identity. Chemical changes turn the matter into a new kind of matter with different properties. For example, when paper is burnt, it becomes ash and will never be paper again. The difference between them is that physical changes are temporary or only last for a little while, and chemical changes are permanent, which means they last forever. Physical and chemical changes both affect the state of matter.
2. When I got home from school after a long boring day, I took out the peanut butter, jelly, and bread. After taking the lid off of the jars, I spread the peanut butter on one side of the bread and the jelly on the other, and then I put the two pieces of bread together. After that, I enjoyed it while watching “Cops” on the TV. I swear, that was the best peanut butter and jelly sandwich I ever ate.
3. No one knows exactly what causes tornados, but some scientists believe that when warm air meets cold air, a tornado may form. The reason for this is that the warm air is lighter than the cold air, so it rises up fast and meets different winds moving different directions. Under the right conditions, this can cause a tornado. Though there is still much mystery surrounding tornados, many people believe that when warm moist air meets cool dry air, tornados can result.
4. The playground at the park is built for fun. There are plenty ways to get to the top just like – a ladder, a stairway, and even a rock wall. Once at the top, kids can find plenty of things to play with, like a curved tube, two different steering wheels, and even a tic-tac-toe board. And two curved sliding boards make the perfect way to return to the ground.
5. Working on a computer may be easier and safer than working in a mine, but it doesn’t come without risks. Using a computer for a long time can lead to poor eyesight, muscle loosening, back pain, and injuries to the hands and wrists. If you find yourself working or playing on a computer quite regularly, take a few steps to prevent these problems and you’ll thank yourself later. When you are computing for a long time, take frequent breaks. Get up and walk around every once and while. Exercise a little bit. Take your eyes off of the computer screen. Stretch your hands and wrists. Straighten your back. It can be hard to pull yourself away from your computer once you get into a zone, but your body will thank you later if you do. Make your health a priority and don’t worry so much about what’s happening on that little screen.
6. Bicycles are an excellent choice when it comes to transportation. Biking is healthy and faster than walking, but it is also dangerous. Each year tens of thousands of people are killed or injured while riding a bicycle. This is because our roads are designed for motorists and not cyclists, but we can change the landscape. Each time a road is built or rebuilt, we should put in bike lanes. Clearly marked bicycle lanes will give cyclists a safer place to ride. Our cyclists deserve this little bit of consideration. In fact, their very lives are depending on it.
7. There’s a reason why dogs are called “man’s best friend.” The good friendship that we have with dogs is thousands of years old and, as with most good friendships, was formed by mutual benefit. Dogs are of great value to people because they use their keen senses to detect threats and alert their owners by barking. You may find your dog’s yapping to be quite annoying, but under some circumstances it can be quite helpful. But people are of great value to dogs too. Dogs who live with people usually have easier access to food and a safer place to stay than they would on their own, and that truly is what friends are for.</h2><br />
