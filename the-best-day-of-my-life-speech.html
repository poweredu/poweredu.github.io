A high quality protein contains eaa in a ratio that matches human requirements. A protein which is lacking or low in one or more eaa is termed a low quality protein. The eaa which is in the shortest supply is called the ‘limiting’ amino acid. In general, animal proteins tend to be high quality while vegetable proteins tend to be low quality.

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive. It begins in the east at the Yellow Sea, travels near China’s capital, Beijing, and continues west through numerous provinces. For thousands of miles, it winds like a snake through China’s varied terrain. Smaller walls extend from the main wall. According to conservative estimates, the Great Wall’s length is approximately 2,400 miles, its thickness ranges from 15-30 feet wide, and it reaches in height to about 25 feet.

That was less than four years ago. He could not understand those months of a great hunger that was not of the body nor yet of the mind, a craving that had seized on him one quiet night when the moon was abroad and under the dappled shadow of the trees in the plaza, man wooed maid. Was he being cheated by life? Love--he seemed to have missed it. Or was the love that others told about a mere fabrication of perfervid imagination, an exaggeration of the commonplace, a glorification of insipid monotonies such as made up his love life? Was love a combination of circumstances, or sheer native capacity of soul? In those days love was, for him, still the eternal puzzle; for love, as he knew it, was a stranger to love as he divined it might be. What narrative device was used in the paragraph?Answer:Question 4Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Type TRUE if the given statement is correct and FALSE if it is incorrect.It's best to think of different topics and discover various points of focus so you can keep your options open before writing.Answer:Question 5Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00A pre-writing strategy which is the process of pouring out all your thoughts nonstop in an exact order, language and form as you think them. Select one:a.Brainstormingb.Freewritingc.Clusteringd.LoopingCLEAR MY CHOICEQuestion 6Not yet answeredMarked out of 1.00Refer to the given paragraph below on The Great Wall of China:The Great Wall, or Chang Cheng in Chinese, is massive.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>the value of my life</p><p></p><p>Good day everyone. </p><p></p><p>I am so glad to be here today and to have the opportunity to talk about the value of my life. As I am sure you can relate, life can be full of both good and bad days, and it can sometimes be difficult to find its value. Today I’d like to speak from my experience and share why my life has been worth living.</p><p></p><p>First and foremost, my life has been filled with love. Throughout my entire life I have been surrounded by family and close friends who are always there for me, not just in the good times but also in the bad, which is something that I cannot take for granted. Knowing that there are people who care deeply about me is incredibly humbling and reassuring, and this has given me strength over the years and enabled me to press on even when times were tough.</p><p></p><p>In addition, I consider each day as an opportunity to learn, grow, and discover something new. Each day provides a chance to learn from experiences no matter how small or insignificant it might seem, such as learning patience from a frustrating customer service experience or learning from a mistake. Life is full of learning experiences which I can use as stepping stones for my personal development.</p><p></p><p>My job also plays a key role in the value of my life, as it helps me fulfill my financial responsibilities whether it’s to save for retirement or put food on the table. It also provides mental stimulation on a daily basis, and I find meaning in my work which has made a massive difference in my outlook on life.</p><p></p><p>Finally, one of the most important things I do every day is take time for myself and do things that bring me joy; things like making music, cooking delicious meals, or simply taking a walk outdoors. Taking just a few minutes each day to do something enjoyable gives me room to breathe and helps keep me mentally healthy.</p><p></p><p>Overall, these are just some of the reasons why I believe the value of my life is so great; I am constantly surrounded by love, it's an opportunity to learn and grow daily, it helps me fulfill my financial obligations, and it encourages me to take time for myself. My life isn’t perfect by any means but I feel incredibly lucky to live every day with purpose and passion.</p><p></p><p>Thank you for your attention and for allowing me to share my story.</p><br />

                        <p></p>Value of Time.<p></p><p>Good morning, everyone. </p><p>Today, I want to talk about the value of time. Time is something we cannot control or stop, but it is something we can use effectively. It is one of the most precious things we have in life, and we should use it wisely.</p><p></p><p>Time is a limited resource, and once it's gone, we can't get it back. We all have 24 hours in a day, and it's up to us to make the most of them. That's why it's important to prioritize our time and use it for things that truly matter.</p><p></p><p>To make the most of our time, we need to learn how to manage it. This means setting goals and deadlines, making schedules, and avoiding distractions. We should also learn to say no to things that don't align with our goals or priorities.</p><p></p><p>Remember, time is a valuable commodity, and we should treat it as such. Use your time wisely, and you'll see the results in your personal and professional life. </p><p>Thank you for listening.</p><p></p>Stay motivated -_-<br />
