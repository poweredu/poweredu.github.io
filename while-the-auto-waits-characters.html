What does the last sentence of the story tell us about the young man?5. What do you think is the implication of the story to human lives?6. If you were to end the play, how would you do it?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p></p>A young girl and a young man met at the park. The young girl was sitting on a bench reading a book. When the book fell, the young man immediately swooped down to retrieve it. He then gave it to the young girl and was hesitant to sit beside her until the young girl invited him to do so.From the girl, I think the reason why she's not revealing her true status is that she's not proud of being poor. She brags to other people as she said she's bored from being rich which is not even true. To the young man, Surely, he didn't reveal his real statue is because the girl said that she's bored from being rich and stated that she wanted to marry someone that is not that rich so he pretended to be poor, as a cashier of a restaurant nearby, even though he's a rich one. For short, he pretended to be someone that he's not for the sake of his true lovely feelings for the girl.Yes, they are "white lies". Each of them were pretending to be a person they can't be. They were disguising themselves.The last sentence pertains to the young man's position or class. This was symbolized by the auto, which means he belongs to the high class men. (based from the play adaption of Walter Wykes)The implication of a story to human life can have a good benefit. In life, we cannot experience everything mostly when we are still young. The series of event in the story that we have read can be our experience to make a decision; it means that our decision will strengthen through the event happening in the story.If I were the author I would like to end my story with a lesson in life or realization of the main character, where everyone can relate with it.Pa brainliest po<p></p>Follow<br />

                        According to the freedictionary.com, a white lie is "a harmless or trivial lie, especially one told to avoid hurting someone's feelings". In the situations of O. Henry's play, While The Auto Waits, the lies that the characters made were simply harmless, but they weren't necessary told to avoid hurting someone's feelings.<br /><br />In conclusion, I wouldn't exactly consider these as "white lies".<br />

                            9. Thought:why,the psychology behind the character's action.why does a character want what he wants? it's about on while the auto waits of the young man and the girl please answer pls need naaa​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Understanding the psychology behind a character's actions is an important part of character development in fiction writing. The motivations behind a character's desires, wants, and needs can help to create a more realistic and compelling character that readers can relate to and empathize with.</p><p></p><p>In the scenario you described, where a young man and a girl are waiting in a car, there could be many different psychological reasons why they want what they want. For example, the young man may be impatient and want to get to their destination quickly because he is anxious or stressed. Alternatively, he may be excited to see someone or attend an event and be eager to arrive. On the other hand, the girl may be feeling apprehensive or nervous about the destination and may be delaying their arrival in order to avoid the situation.</p><p></p><p>The psychology behind a character's actions can also be influenced by their personality, background, and past experiences. For example, if the young man has a history of being impulsive or adventurous, this may influence his desire to get to their destination quickly. If the girl has had negative experiences in similar situations in the past, this may make her more reluctant to arrive at their destination.</p><p></p><p>In order to understand the psychology behind a character's actions, it's important to consider their thoughts, feelings, and behaviors in context. This includes understanding their internal motivations as well as the external factors that may be influencing their actions. By doing so, writers can create more complex and realistic characters that readers will be more invested in.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>In the short story "While the Auto Waits," the main character, a young man, wants to impress the girl he is with. Throughout the story, we can see that the young man is trying to impress the girl by showing off his knowledge and skills. He talks about cars and driving, and he even tries to fix the car's engine to impress her.</p><p></p><p>The psychology behind the young man's actions is rooted in his desire to be liked and admired by the girl. This desire is often driven by a need for validation and self-worth. The young man wants to feel important and valued, and by impressing the girl, he believes that he can achieve this. Additionally, the young man may be motivated by the desire for love and connection. He may believe that by impressing the girl, he can win her affection and develop a deeper connection with her.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the young man's actions are driven by his desire for validation, self-worth, and love. These desires are common human needs, and they often motivate our actions and decisions in relationships.</p><br />

                        From the girl, I think the reason why she's not revealing her true status is that she's not proud of being poor. She brags to other people as she said she's bored from being rich which is not even true. To the young man, Surely, he didn't reveal his real statue is because the girl said that she's bored from being rich and stated that she wanted to marry someone that is not that rich so he pretended to be poor, as a cashier of a restaurant nearby, even though he's a rich one. For short, he pretended to be someone that he's not for the sake of his true lovely feelings for the girl.<br /><br /><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>As I read through the play "While the Auto Waits," I began to notice certain traits that define each character. The first character that stood out to me was the protagonist, John. From his actions and dialogue, it is clear that he is a cautious and logical person, always thinking before he acts. His tendency to overthink and analyze situations can sometimes make him seem hesitant, but it is ultimately what keeps him safe. Additionally, John has a strong sense of responsibility, which is evident when he takes charge of the situation after the accident.<br /><br />On the other hand, the other driver involved in the accident, Mrs. Judson, comes across as impulsive and careless. She does not take responsibility for her actions and instead tries to shift the blame onto John. Her behavior throughout the play is selfish and unreasonable, which makes her a frustrating character to interact with.<br /><br />Finally, there is the auto mechanic who appears towards the end of the play. He seems friendly and helpful, but there is also an underlying sense of greed and opportunism in his actions. He wants to take advantage of John's vulnerability and charge him more than necessary for the repairs.<br /><br />Overall, the character analysis sketch reveals that each character in "While the Auto Waits" has distinct personality traits that shape their actions and interactions with others. These traits create a dynamic and engaging story that keeps the audience invested until the very end.</strong></p><p></p><br />
