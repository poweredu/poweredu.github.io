What did you feel after reading the story? "As a university professor, the challenges of moving to virtual classes were not far behind. Even though I had just received a certification in virtual distance education. During this semester, I found myself teaching a course on contemporary models of psychotherapy. Two weeks after the quarantine began, the unit I would teach on would be expressive therapies. I was thinking how to translate a dynamic application in the classroom into a virtual activity. At that moment it occurred to me, rather than giving a class, my students needed that space to process the new reality of COVID-19. So, not only did I give a virtual class on expressive therapies, I converted the space into an art therapy live application as well. The goal was that each of them from their homes could express themselves from their homes through four drawings, allowing creativity to flow and emphasizing the process, not the result. By discussing the theories, they analyzed their arts meaning, which in turn promoted laughter and participation among them. Also, the group discussions allowed them to find new meanings, named their concerns and see the positive side of it all. But more importantly, it 15​</a>

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</a>

- An increasing problem of great concern for academic institutions is the pervasiveness of cheating among students. Further compounding this problem is advancements in technology that have created new ways for students to engage in cheating. Despite a growing interest in technology-facilitated cheating, little is known about why students may employ electronic resources to cheat. However, Akers’ social learning theory offers one plausible explanation. Surveys were collected from a sample of 534 college students at a large southeastern university in order to quantify the prevalence and frequency of Internet-facilitated cheating. These surveys allowed for an exploration of factors associated with this form of cheating and a comparison between what we refer to as E-cheating and traditional forms of cheating. Results indicate that approximately 40% of students have engaged in some form of E-cheating in the last year. Social learning variables emerge as the strongest predictors of both the occurrence and frequency of E-cheating while self-control and strain variables have little effect.
- Academic dishonesty in the online cheating environment of distance education learning has gained traction in the past decade. By a few simple keystrokes, students can find a wide array of online services for hire to write research papers, complete homework assignments, or enroll on behalf of the student on record to take the entire online course. While institutions in higher education have seen online learning as a vehicle to increase student enrollments adding to their bottom line, the number of Internet cheating companies to support academic dishonesty has also increased sustainability. Students have many options when it comes to receiving unethical assistance in the online class environment. Rowe (2010) cited three common methods students used to cheat in online courses. Students wait to take their assessment so they could get answers from others, students retook assessments based on false claims and students received unauthorized assistance during exams (Rowe, 2010). There are many more options to cheat online. Students wait for answers, claim fraudulent error messages, collusion, essay plagiarism and buying answers.
Challenges dealing with academic dishonesty in the online area have become more rampant, leaving faculty and college administrators at odds how to prevent such behavior in both traditional and online classes.
- There has been substantial research in the area of student cheating in traditional face-to-face classes but much less on cheating using technology often termed “e-cheating.” With the increased offering of online courses to provide students with greater flexibility, concerns regarding academic integrity arise. The authors have utilized a biannual survey to gather information on student cheating in both traditional and online courses. This paper summarizes the results of the authors’ surveys for the past five years. Findings show that the most common type of cheating activity reported by students is the downloading of Internet papers and representing them as the student’s own work. In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />

In addition, students report that they believe that other students cheat more on homework problems as compared to exams, term papers, and Internet projects. The most troubling finding for educators, however, is that e-cheating appears to be on the rise.</h2><br />
                        <p>Ang isang pagtaas ng problema ng labis na pag-aalala para sa mga institusyong pang-akademiko ay ang paglaganap ng pandaraya sa mga mag-aaral. Ang karagdagang pagsasama-sama sa problemang ito ay mga pagsulong sa teknolohiya na lumikha ng mga bagong paraan para sa mga mag-aaral na makisali sa pandaraya. Sa kabila ng lumalaking interes sa pandaraya na pinadali ng teknolohiya, kaunti ang nalalaman tungkol sa kung bakit maaaring gumamit ang mga mag-aaral ng elektronikong mapagkukunan upang manloko. Gayunpaman, nag-aalok ang teorya ng panlipunan ng pagkatuto ni Akers ng isang makatuwirang paliwanag. Ang mga survey ay nakolekta mula sa isang sample ng 534 mga mag-aaral sa kolehiyo sa isang malaking timog-silangan na unibersidad upang masukat ang pagkalat at dalas ng pandaraya na pinadali ng Internet. Pinapayagan ng mga survey na ito ang isang paggalugad ng mga salik na nauugnay sa ganitong uri ng pandaraya at isang paghahambing sa pagitan ng tinutukoy namin bilang E-cheating at tradisyunal na mga paraan ng pandaraya. Ipinapahiwatig ng mga resulta na humigit-kumulang na 40% ng mga mag-aaral ang nakatuon sa ilang anyo ng E-cheating sa nakaraang taon. Ang mga variable ng pagkatuto sa lipunan ay lumalabas bilang pinakamalakas na tagahula ng parehong paglitaw at dalas ng E-cheating habang ang mga variable ng pagpipigil sa sarili at pilay ay may maliit na epekto.</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social science disciplines
</p><p>Social science covers a broad range of disciplines.
</p><p>
</p><p>Demography and social statistics, methods and computing
</p><p>Demography is the study of populations and population changes and trends, using resources such as statistics of births, deaths and disease.
</p><p>Social statistics, methods and computing involves the collection and analysis of quantitative and qualitative social science data.
</p><p>Development studies, human geography and environmental planning
</p><p>Development studies is a multidisciplinary branch of the social sciences which addresses a range of social and economic issues related to developing or low-income countries.
</p><p>Human geography studies the world, its people, communities and cultures, and differs from physical geography mainly in that it focuses on human activities and their impact - for instance on environmental change.
</p><p>Environmental planning explores the decision-making processes for managing relationships within and between human systems and natural systems, in order to manage these processes in an effective, transparent and equitable manner.
</p><p>Economics, management and business studies
</p><p>Economics seeks to understand how individuals interact within the social structure, to address key questions about the production and exchange of goods and services.
</p><p>Management and business studies explores a wide range of aspects relating to the activities and management of business, such as strategic and operational management, organisational psychology, employment relations, marketing, accounting, finance and logistics.
</p><p>Education, social anthropology, and linguistics
</p><p>Education is one of the most important social sciences, exploring how people learn and develop.
</p><p>Social anthropology is the study of how human societies and social structures are organised and understood.
</p><p>Linguistics focuses on language and how people communicate through spoken sounds and words.
</p><p>Law, economic and social history
</p><p>Law focuses on the rules created by governments and people to ensure a more orderly society.
</p><p>Economic and social history looks at past events to learn from history and better understand the processes of contemporary society.
</p><p>Politics and international relations
</p><p>Politics focuses on democracy and the relationship between people and policy, at all levels up from the individual to a national and international level.
</p><p>International relations is the study of relationships between countries, including the roles of other organisations.
</p><p>Psychology and sociology
</p><p>Psychology studies the human mind and try to understand how people and groups experience the world through various emotions, ideas, and conscious states.
</p><p>Sociology involves groups of people, rather than individuals, and attempts to understand the way people relate to each other and function as a society or social sub-groups.
</p><p>Science and technology studies
</p><p>Science and technology studies is concerned with what scientists do, what their role is in our society, the history and culture of science, and the policies and debates that shape our modern scientific and technological world.
</p><p>Social policy and social work
</p><p>Social policy is an interdisciplinary and applied subject concerned with the analysis of societies' responses to social need, focusing on aspects of society, economy and policy that are necessary to human existence, and how these can be provided.
</p><p>Social work focuses on social change, problem-solving in human relationships and the empowerment and liberation of people to enhance social justice.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />

What is the importance of the three major social science theories in examining the socio-cultural, economic and political conditions of our society about distance learning education?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>When considering theories of learning, LIDT professionals should also consider sociocultural perspectives and the role that culture, interaction, and collaboration have on quality learning. Modern social learning theories stem from the work of Russian psychologist Vygotsky, who produced his ideas between 1924 and 1934 as a reaction to existing conflicting approaches in psychology (Kozulin, 1990). Vygotsky’s ideas are most recognized for identifying the role social interactions and culture play in the development of higher-order thinking skills, and it is especially valuable for the insights it provides about the dynamic “interdependence between individual and social processes in the construction of knowledge” (John-Steiner &amp; Mahn, 1996, p. 192). Vygotsky’s views are often considered primarily as developmental theories, focusing on qualitative changes in behavior over time as attempts to explain unseen processes of development of thought, language, and higher-order thinking skills. Although Vygotsky’s intent was  mainly to understand higher psychological processes in children, his ideas have many implications and practical applications for learners of all ages.</p><p>Interpretations of Vygotsky’s and other sociocultural scholars’ work have led to diverse perspectives and a variety of new approaches to education. Today, sociocultural theory and related approaches are widely recognized and accepted in psychology and education and are especially valued in the field of applied linguistics because of its underlying notion that language and thought are connected. Sociocultural theory is also becoming increasingly influential in the field of instructional design. In this chapter, we first review some of the fundamental principles of sociocultural theory of learning. We then suggest design implications for learning, teaching, and education in general. Following, we consider how sociocultural theories of learning should influence instructional design.</p><p></p><br />
