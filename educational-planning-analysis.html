                                            Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing. I would highly suggest that the authors reread issues of the journal of Second Language Writing and Reading in a Foreign Language.type of Document: (Choices: Plan, proposal, email, position paper, memo, excuse letter, argumentative paper, critic paper, etc.)Purpose of the Review: (to inform, to demonstrate, to persuade, to entertain)Explain your answer in one to two sentencesWriter’s Persona and provide evidence: (The way the author delivers his/her words: formal, informal, uses colloquialism, etc.)Explain your answer in one to two sentences.Intended Reader: (Who are the target audience?)Strengths (positive ideas about the material)Weakness  (negative ideas about the material)need ko na po​</a>

Operations managers formulate strategies and control the resources of the organization by givingmuch attention to etfectiveness and efficiency of its use.3. Management is broken down into four major functions.4. Planning involves assigning tasks that would ensure harmonious working relationships among members of the organization.5. The changing culture, way of life, value and belief systems have influence on the plans and operations of the organization refers to environmental factors.6. There are times that food service business would be classified as hybrid, in cases like sellingmerchandise items other than what it produces.7. The SWOT Analysis is a tool that is useful to the organization if it wants to know the strengths andweaknesses that it has. It analyzes external factors or elements that has a positive and negativeeffects to performance of the organization.8. Manufacturing business incurs expenses like labor, overhead costs and raw materials.9.

                            11. Analyze the following text very carefully. Then, complete the table that follows. This paper purports to assess the linguistic complexity of students’ narratives and reading texts. However, the authors never stated the purpose behind the study. The authors provide no motivations and goals for the study, no research questions, no strong methodological practices, and very few findings that can be easily interpreted. While reading the study, every new sentence is a surprise. There are no details and the entire paper is completely under referenced.	Below I will discuss some of the major problems with the paper. First, theauthors never provide a rationale for their study. They never give a reason as to why they are studying reading and writing together and they fail to link the two skills. The authors assume that the reader knows the narrative and made no attempt to assist them in developing the narrative of the paper. Another major problem with the paper is the naiveté that is apparent in the literature review, the methods, and the analysis. The literature review is perhaps two pages long and boosts up on their knowledge of L2 writing and reading theory before they submit a paper to a professional journal. 	It is interesting that the language background of the participants is nevermade explicit (participants are at the mid beginners to high beginners level in using English as a second language). The extent to which any results found in the study would be widely generalizable to what is typically conceived as an EFL/ESL learner is not clear. Moreover, the author continually draws on literature meant for an L1 acquisition audience and therefore of dubious extension to L2 contexts. 	The methods section contains no details at all. Ten participants per gradelevel, in a stratified random sample, hardly seemed enough to get much stable data. Since, there are only ten participants per grade level in both accredited and nonaccredited schools due to logistical constraints; the paper is more on exploratory study. In other words, it seems a stretch to ask most journal readers to generalize from such a limited sample from such a specific population. The authors state that “pupils were not given limits as to time and number of words, for them to be relaxed in their narrative production” (p.5). However, later the authors explain that those written data also form the basis of the corpus used for analysis. How does this differential production affect the results of the analysis? Surely, a participant who produces 1,000 words will have different results from one who produces 500. It is not clear how the authors can assert any sort of pattern from linguistic ‘snapshot’ from just 10 students per school, producing such heterogeneous data samples. Again, from such a modest sample size.	In general, the paper is hard to read. This likely goes back to the lack ofresearch problems. There are few transitions and, organizationally, the paper does not set up any expectations for the reader. The first paragraph is a great example because it contains a single sentence and at least five different clauses. The final paragraph in the introduction (right before the methods sections) is another example. I have read that paragraph four times and am not sure how to process it.	There are major problems with this paper, but I do not have the time or the energy to discuss them all. The authors really need to rethink the purpose of the collected data and educate themselves in the field of L2 reading and writing.
