                                            find uknown words Rather than the overworked adobo (so identified as the Philippine stew in foreign cookbooks), sinigang seems to me the dish most representative of Filipino taste. We like the lightly boiled, the slightly soured, the dish that includes fish (or shrimp or meat) vegetables and broth. It is adaptable to all tastes (if you don’t like shrimp, then bangus, or pork), to all classes and budgets, (even ayungin, in humble little piles, find their way into the pot), and to seasons and availability (walang talong, mahal ang gabi, kangkong na lang.) But why? Why does sinigang find its way to bare dulang, to formica-topped restaurant booth, to gleaming ilustrado table? Why does one like anything at all? How is a people’s taste shaped?But still, why soured? Aside from the fact that sour broths are cooling in hot weather, could it be perhaps because the dish is meant to be eaten against the mild background of rice? Easy to plant and harvest, and allowing more than one crop a year, rice is ubiquitous on the landscape. One can picture our ancestors settling down beside their rivers and finally tuning to the cultivation of fields, with rice as one of the first steady crops​</a>

                                            Maaga pa lamang ay bumalik na ang grupo ng Biyahe ni Drew sa Mariveles Portpara simulan ang tour sa isang sikat na touristspot, ang Five Fingers.Tinawag itong Five Fingers dahil kung titingnan gamit ang Satelite, makikita mula sa itaas na hugis daliri ang limang isla. Mula sa Mariveles Port,aabutin ng dalawampu’t limang minutong boat ride angpa-ChochicosPoint, ang thumb o hinlalaki ng limang isla. Tinawag na Chochitos Point ang isla mula sa Spanish word na chochitos na nangangahulugang baboy sa tagalog, dahil kung titingnan ito sa airial shot ang isla ay hugis baboy. At dahil summer, mapapansin na wala masyadong halaman o vegetation ang bundok dahil sa wild fire. Pero kung gustong makita na berde ang paligid, bumisita tuwing “ber” month dahil buhay na buhay ang mga halaman at berdeng-berde ang mga bundok. Ang Five Fingers ay nagsisilbing tirahan ng mga Lawin sa buong Mariveles. Ito ay nangangahulugan malusog ang environment dito at hindi ito nagagalaw. Marami ring wild life ang makikita sa paligid ngunit marami ring nakalutang na basura dala ng habagat at amihan season. Ang mga basurang galing sa Manila Bay ay dito napapadpad. Sa pagitan naman ng index finger o hintuturo ay tinawag nilang Talaga Beach, ang middle finger o Puntang Mahaba. Makikita ang cave na maaring pasukin o languyin kapag low tide. Dito rin maaaring mag- snorkeling. Ang mismong beach naman ng Puntang Haba ay sikat na sikat dahil sa naglalakihang bato na may iba’t ibang taas at laki. Katunayan, paboritong Instagram spot daw ito ng mga turista. Pero may ibang pasaway na bisita na walang magawa , isinulat ang kanilang mga pangalan sa bato at ipinagmamalaki pa sa IG. May parte rin nito na maaaring mag-cliff diving ngunit huwag basta-basta tatalon. Imporatanteng makinig muna sa tour guide kung saan safe na tumalon. Ang ring finger o palasingsingan o Naiclec Point.Dito namanmakikita ang iba’t ibang rock formation na tila hugis palaka. Puwede ring mag- snorkeling at swimming. At ang huling daliri ay ang pinky finger o hinliliit, ang Longos Kawayan. Kung prenup location ang hanap ito ang indemand pagdating sa mga couples at photographer na may gusto ng kakaibang konsepto. Marami kasing maaaring gawing background para sa picture tulad ng mga naglalakihang bato na may maliliit na butas sa ibaba. Puwede rin daw magmukhang naglalakad sa tubig sa gitna ng cove at puwede rin umakyat sa mga bato sa itaas at mag-post na tila nasa eksena ng pelikula ng Titanic o Lion King. Kahit anong post ay maari, mag-ingat lamang sa ibabaw ng mga bato dahil madali itong mabiyak. Matapos ang finger hopping, sinugod naman nila ang Kawader Camp kung saan naghihintay ang masarap na pananghalian.

Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus:The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________Easy Warm-up: ________________________Fire Starter: ________________________Audience Reader:_________________________2. GOLBAL WARMING:Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects.POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________EASY WARM-UP:_________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________AUDIENCE READER:_____________________3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ______________________FIRE STARTER: ________________________AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence,POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________EASY WARM-UP:______________________FIRE STARTER:________________________AUDIENCE READER:___________________​</a>

Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay. As the capital city of the Bulacan, the city of Malolos is comprised of 51 barangays, including five coastal islands. Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September. The temperature in Malolos varies annually with the lowest temperature occuring in January at 20.4 °C to the highest at 34.9 °C in April.Interview.So now we are currently here in the Malolos municipality to ask our Mayor.

                                            What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records

                            7. find uknown words Rather than the overworked adobo (so identified as the Philippine stew in foreign cookbooks), sinigang seems to me the dish most representative of Filipino taste. We like the lightly boiled, the slightly soured, the dish that includes fish (or shrimp or meat) vegetables and broth. It is adaptable to all tastes (if you don’t like shrimp, then bangus, or pork), to all classes and budgets, (even ayungin, in humble little piles, find their way into the pot), and to seasons and availability (walang talong, mahal ang gabi, kangkong na lang.) But why? Why does sinigang find its way to bare dulang, to formica-topped restaurant booth, to gleaming ilustrado table? Why does one like anything at all? How is a people’s taste shaped?But still, why soured? Aside from the fact that sour broths are cooling in hot weather, could it be perhaps because the dish is meant to be eaten against the mild background of rice? Easy to plant and harvest, and allowing more than one crop a year, rice is ubiquitous on the landscape.

                            10. Maaga pa lamang ay bumalik na ang grupo ng Biyahe ni Drew sa Mariveles Portpara simulan ang tour sa isang sikat na touristspot, ang Five Fingers.Tinawag itong Five Fingers dahil kung titingnan gamit ang Satelite, makikita mula sa itaas na hugis daliri ang limang isla. Mula sa Mariveles Port,aabutin ng dalawampu’t limang minutong boat ride angpa-ChochicosPoint, ang thumb o hinlalaki ng limang isla. Tinawag na Chochitos Point ang isla mula sa Spanish word na chochitos na nangangahulugang baboy sa tagalog, dahil kung titingnan ito sa airial shot ang isla ay hugis baboy. At dahil summer, mapapansin na wala masyadong halaman o vegetation ang bundok dahil sa wild fire. Pero kung gustong makita na berde ang paligid, bumisita tuwing “ber” month dahil buhay na buhay ang mga halaman at berdeng-berde ang mga bundok. Ang Five Fingers ay nagsisilbing tirahan ng mga Lawin sa buong Mariveles. Ito ay nangangahulugan malusog ang environment dito at hindi ito nagagalaw. Marami ring wild life ang makikita sa paligid ngunit marami ring nakalutang na basura dala ng habagat at amihan season. Ang mga basurang galing sa Manila Bay ay dito napapadpad. Sa pagitan naman ng index finger o hintuturo ay tinawag nilang Talaga Beach, ang middle finger o Puntang Mahaba. Makikita ang cave na maaring pasukin o languyin kapag low tide. Dito rin maaaring mag- snorkeling. Ang mismong beach naman ng Puntang Haba ay sikat na sikat dahil sa naglalakihang bato na may iba’t ibang taas at laki. Katunayan, paboritong Instagram spot daw ito ng mga turista. Pero may ibang pasaway na bisita na walang magawa , isinulat ang kanilang mga pangalan sa bato at ipinagmamalaki pa sa IG. May parte rin nito na maaaring mag-cliff diving ngunit huwag basta-basta tatalon. Imporatanteng makinig muna sa tour guide kung saan safe na tumalon. Ang ring finger o palasingsingan o Naiclec Point.Dito namanmakikita ang iba’t ibang rock formation na tila hugis palaka. Puwede ring mag- snorkeling at swimming. At ang huling daliri ay ang pinky finger o hinliliit, ang Longos Kawayan. Kung prenup location ang hanap ito ang indemand pagdating sa mga couples at photographer na may gusto ng kakaibang konsepto. Marami kasing maaaring gawing background para sa picture tulad ng mga naglalakihang bato na may maliliit na butas sa ibaba. Puwede rin daw magmukhang naglalakad sa tubig sa gitna ng cove at puwede rin umakyat sa mga bato sa itaas at mag-post na tila nasa eksena ng pelikula ng Titanic o Lion King. Kahit anong post ay maari, mag-ingat lamang sa ibabaw ng mga bato dahil madali itong mabiyak. Matapos ang finger hopping, sinugod naman nila ang Kawader Camp kung saan naghihintay ang masarap na pananghalian.

Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus:The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________Easy Warm-up: ________________________Fire Starter: ________________________Audience Reader:_________________________2. GOLBAL WARMING:Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects.POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________EASY WARM-UP:_________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________AUDIENCE READER:_____________________3. Modular Distance Learning Of all the alternative learning modalities offered by the Department of Education (DepEd) this upcoming school year, most students prefer to use the modular" distance learning option. Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ________________________FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________EASY WARM-UP: ______________________FIRE STARTER: ________________________AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17. The prevalence of cyberviolence for males (44 per cent) is almost the same for females (43 per cent). Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence,POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________EASY WARM-UP:______________________FIRE STARTER:________________________AUDIENCE READER:___________________​</h2><br />

Pa help po ano pong pwede o magandang conclusion dito?Intro.Meaning. - Disaster preparedness plays a critical role in mitigating the adverse health effects of natural disaster. Preparedness is defined by the United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) (United Nations International Strategy and Disaster Reduction, 2009) as knowledge, capabilities, and actions of governments, organizations, community groups, and individuals “to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from, the impacts of likely, imminent or current hazard events or conditions.” Preparedness efforts range from individual-level activities (such as first aid training), to household actions (e.g., stockpiling of equipment and supplies), community efforts (like training and field exercises), and governmental strategies (including early warning systems, contingency plans, evacuation routes, and public information dissemination). BackgroundThe city of Malolos is located in the southwestern region of the Bulacan province in the Central Luzon, Philippines and north of Manila Bay. As the capital city of the Bulacan, the city of Malolos is comprised of 51 barangays, including five coastal islands. Malolos has two distinct seasons referred to as wet season (June to November) and dry season (December to May). Variations in rainfall paired with seasonal variations in air currents bring in string winds, storm surges, and typhoons particularly in the wet season from June to September. The temperature in Malolos varies annually with the lowest temperature occuring in January at 20.4 °C to the highest at 34.9 °C in April.Interview.So now we are currently here in the Malolos municipality to ask our Mayor.

                            17. What is It
In this activity, you are going to learn the content of this module to better 
understand the lesson on how to implement a plan for animal raising; monitor 
growth and progress; keep an updated record of growth and progress; and 
expand/enhance one’s knowledge of animal raising using the internet. 
Starting to operate a farm, like any other business endeavor, requires 
research, critical thinking, educational background or technical know-how, and 
enough funding. Proper execution of the business plan equates to a sound daily farm 
operation. 
I. Implementing the Plan for Family’s Animal Raising Project
Implementing means putting into action what has been planned by following 
every step or process in it. Successful implementation needs control, suspension,
and guidance in the care of animals. Here are a few things to follow: 
1. Be systematic in raising and caring for your animals. Follow your schedule of
work including preparation of feeds, time for feeding, amount of feeds for each
animal, bathing, cleaning of housing and surrounding, recording,
immunization, visit to the veterinarian and actual weighing.
2. Use a chart to record the growth and progress of each animal. Have a specific
period (weekly/ monthly) when to record weight. The chart should contain age
of animal, date of weighing, weight taken weekly or monthly, and weight gained.
3. Monitor regularly the growth and progress of animals using the chart.
4. If problems occur regarding the health and progress of animals, consult other
experienced animal growers.
5. Surf the internet to gain more knowledge of animals raising and be updated of
recent studies.
A. Monitoring Growth and Progress
Animal raising project is expected to gain as an additional source of family 
income. By this, you need to maintain the records of all your transaction. 
Assuming that business is good, farm products are abundant and daily operations 
are at its peak, you should be able to set standards for all aspects of production. 
For example, the quantity of milk produced every day, the number of young born 
every breeding cycle, the number of animals sold every selling season, growth and 
progress of the animal weekly/monthly, etc. Some of the important records to keep 
for monitoring are:
1. Litter Records
• Birth weight (1.5 kg is good)
• Weaning weight (18kg is good)
2. Dams/Sow Record
• Number of piglets weaned per year (18 is good)
3. Marketing
• Number of Animals, age and weight
4. Feed Conversion Rate
• A satisfactory conversion ratio should be 1 kg live weight gain for 3 to
5 kg of feed consumed by an animal.
5. Costs and Returns of Production
• All expenses and sales recorded for one year to compute the returns
on your investment (ROI) at the end of the year.</h2><br />

Your task is to raise and formulate three questions per topic identified as; Easy Warm-up, Fire Starter, and Audience Reader. You may also add follow-up questions 1. Novel Corona Virus: The COVID-19 pandemic is far more than a health crisis: it is affecting societies and economies at their core. While the impact of the pandemic will vary from country to country, it will most likely increase poverty and inequalities at a global scale. Assessing the impacts of the COVID-19 crisis on societies, economies and vulnerable groups is fundamental to inform and tailor the responses of governments and partners to recover from the crisis and ensure that no one is left behind in this effort. Possible Questions:___________________ Easy Warm-up: ________________________ Fire Starter: ________________________ Audience Reader:_________________________ 2. GOLBAL WARMING: Studies shows that Earth's climate has been getting warmer. it's average temperature has risen a little more than 1 degree Fahrenheit during the pass 100 years or so. this amount may not seem like much. but small temperature changes can lead to big effects. POSSIBLE QUESTION:_____________________ EASY WARM-UP:_________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 3.

Based on the partial results of the Learner Enrolment and Survey Forns (LESFs) distributed during the enrolment period, it showed 7.2 million enrollees prefer to use modular distance learning, TV &amp; Radio based instructions and other modalities while only 2 million enrolees prefer online for school year 2020-2021 POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ________________________ FIRE STARTER:_________________________ AUDIENCE READER:_____________________ 4. Agricultural production In the Philippines, there is a correlation between rainfall and civil conflict, and manifests through agricultural production. The increased rainfall during the wet season in the Philippines is proven to be harmful to agriculture as it leads to flooding and/or water logging. This above average rainfall is associated with more conflict related incidents and casualties" The rainfall has a negative effect on rice which is an important crop that a majority of the country depends on as both a food source and employment. A poor nice crop can lead to large impacts on the wellbeing of poor Filipino and cause widespread contempt for the government and more support for insurgent groups. Climate change is expected to amplify seasonal variation of rainfall in the Pluilippines and exacerbate ongoing civil conflict in the country POSSIBLE QUESTIONS:__________________ EASY WARM-UP: ______________________ FIRE STARTER: ________________________ AUDIENCE READER:______________________ 5. Cyberbullying In the Philippines, latest national data show that cyberviolence affects almost half of children aged 13-17.

Violence against children, in all forms including online bullying or cyberbullying, has devastating effects on the physical and emotional wellbeing of young people. This can create lasting emotional and psychological scars, even physical harm. It is particularly challenging to address since children are vulnerable and have easy access to the internet, making them easy targets of online violence, POSSIBLEQUESTION:____________________ EASY WARM-UP:______________________ FIRE STARTER:________________________ AUDIENCE READER:___________________Dito na lang Po pa answer&lt;3​</h2><br />
