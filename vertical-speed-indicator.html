Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time.2. The value of acceleration due to gravity is 8.8 m/s?3. When the ball is thrown upward and reach its maximum height, the ball will remain in the air.4. "Free-fall” motion is a Uniformly Accelerated Motion that takes place in a vertical direction.5. Objects moving upwards or downwards in the Earth's gravitational field always accelerate towards thecenter of the Earth.6. When the object is thrown, it has the same initial speed in free fall as it did before it was released.7. The velocity can be positive or negative and is indicated by the sign of our slope. This tells us in whichdirection the object moves.8. Constant velocity means that the object in motion is moving in a straight line at a constant speed.9. When the object comes in contact with the ground or any other object, it is no longer in free fall and itsacceleration of g is no longer valid.10. The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth.​</a>

Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time.2. The value of acceleration due to gravity is 8.8 m/s?3. When the ball is thrown upward and reach its maximum height, the ball will remain in the air4. "Free fall motion is a Uniformly Accelerated Motion that takes place in a vertical direction.5. Objects moving upwards or downwards in the Earth's gravitational field always accelerate towards thecenter of the Earth6. When the object is thrown, it has the same initial speed in free fall as it did before it was released7. The velocity can be positive or negative and is indicated by the sign of our slope. This tells us in whichdirection the object moves.8. Constant velocity means that the object in motion is moving in a straight line at a constant speed.9. When the object comes in contact with the ground or any other object, it is no longer in free fall and itsacceleration of g is no longer valid10. The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth.​</a>

What is the main difference between the ideas of Galileo and Aristotle regarding freely falling bodies? a. He argued that object released at the same time from the same height, regardless of their weight, will fall at the same time. b. He argued that object released at the different time from the same height, regardless of their weight, will fall at the same time. c. He argued that object released at the same time from the different height, regardless of their weight, will fall at the different time.d. All of the above. 2. What is the viewpoint of Aristotle regarding freely falling objects? a. The heavier object fall faster than lighter objects. b. The lighter objects will fall faster than heavier objects. c. Both A and B is correct D. No correct answer. 3. What is the tendency of an object to remain at rest or to move at uniform speed along a straight line? a. inertia b. acceleration C. resistance d. all of these 4. The acceleration due to gravity has a standard value of 9.8 m/s. Consider a ball thrown vertically upwards from the ground with a velocity of 30 m/s. What will happen to its speed as the ball rises? a. As the ball rises, its speed decreases at the rate of 10 m/s every second until it reaches the top of it flight where it stops momentarily to change direction. b. a. As the ball rises, its speed increases at the rate of 5 m/s every second until it reaches the top of its flight where it stops momentarily to change direction. c. As the ball rises, its speed decreases at the rate of.5 m/s every second until it reaches the top of its flight where it stops momentarily to change direction. d. All answers are correct. 5. The viewpoint of Aristotle regarding freely falling objects which prevailed until the 17th century was challenged by Galileo Galileo disproved Aristotle's theory by pure reasoning and logical arguments.

                            4. Learning task 2: True or False. Write TRUE if the statement is correct and FALSE if wrong.1. Acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time.2. The value of acceleration due to gravity is 8.8 m/s?3. When the ball is thrown upward and reach its maximum height, the ball will remain in the air.4. "Free-fall” motion is a Uniformly Accelerated Motion that takes place in a vertical direction.5. Objects moving upwards or downwards in the Earth's gravitational field always accelerate towards thecenter of the Earth.6. When the object is thrown, it has the same initial speed in free fall as it did before it was released.7. The velocity can be positive or negative and is indicated by the sign of our slope. This tells us in whichdirection the object moves.8. Constant velocity means that the object in motion is moving in a straight line at a constant speed.9. When the object comes in contact with the ground or any other object, it is no longer in free fall and itsacceleration of g is no longer valid.10. The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth.​</h2><br />

When the ball is thrown upward and reach its maximum height, the ball will remain in the air4. "Free fall motion is a Uniformly Accelerated Motion that takes place in a vertical direction.5. Objects moving upwards or downwards in the Earth's gravitational field always accelerate towards thecenter of the Earth6. When the object is thrown, it has the same initial speed in free fall as it did before it was released7. The velocity can be positive or negative and is indicated by the sign of our slope. This tells us in whichdirection the object moves.8. Constant velocity means that the object in motion is moving in a straight line at a constant speed.9. When the object comes in contact with the ground or any other object, it is no longer in free fall and itsacceleration of g is no longer valid10. The force of gravity causes objects to fall toward the center of Earth.​</h2><br />

                            26. 5. Positive acceleration indicates the object is slowing down. II. MULTIPLE CHOICES: Choose the letter of the best answer and write your answer on the space provided before each number. 1. What is the main difference between the ideas of Galileo and Aristotle regarding freely falling bodies? a. He argued that object released at the same time from the same height, regardless of their weight, will fall at the same time. b. He argued that object released at the different time from the same height, regardless of their weight, will fall at the same time. c. He argued that object released at the same time from the different height, regardless of their weight, will fall at the different time.d. All of the above. 2. What is the viewpoint of Aristotle regarding freely falling objects? a. The heavier object fall faster than lighter objects. b. The lighter objects will fall faster than heavier objects. c. Both A and B is correct D. No correct answer. 3. What is the tendency of an object to remain at rest or to move at uniform speed along a straight line? a. inertia b. acceleration C. resistance d. all of these 4. The acceleration due to gravity has a standard value of 9.8 m/s. Consider a ball thrown vertically upwards from the ground with a velocity of 30 m/s. What will happen to its speed as the ball rises? a. As the ball rises, its speed decreases at the rate of 10 m/s every second until it reaches the top of it flight where it stops momentarily to change direction. b. a. As the ball rises, its speed increases at the rate of 5 m/s every second until it reaches the top of its flight where it stops momentarily to change direction. c. As the ball rises, its speed decreases at the rate of.5 m/s every second until it reaches the top of its flight where it stops momentarily to change direction. d. All answers are correct. 5. The viewpoint of Aristotle regarding freely falling objects which prevailed until the 17th century was challenged by Galileo Galileo disproved Aristotle's theory by pure reasoning and logical arguments.
