We would stay there for as long as we want because the breeze was cold and We would only bid goodbyes when one of my friends' parents would call us to head back home. Soon this former field will hold busy people come and go. Soon heavy or heavy will go back and forth to this land where little feet ran to play. The of this land may fade away but the memories will remain. It may be sad thought, but who knows the mall that they'll build might offer new great moments to live by​</a>

                                            ECHO
Echo, a beautiful mountain nymph, was a great talker and always had to have the last word. 
She was a favorite of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Together they hunted in the woods, swam in 
mountain pools, and caught fish for meals. But Echo’s delightful life was destroyed, all because she 
tried to protect her friends from Hera’s wrath.
 One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that 
her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.
 Echo did not know which nymph was Zeus’s favorite, and so she started a conversation with 
Hera in order to let all the other nymphs escape.” Isn’t it lovely here?” she said. “Yes, indeed,” Hera 
replied, “but I am very busy right now and have no time for talk.”
 “It seems to me you are busy talking,” said Echo, “which is the nicest way to be busy, don’t 
you agree?” She went on and on, and every time Hera tried to get away from her, Echo asked another 
question. By the time Hera got away and ran to the nymphs’ pool, all the nymphs had fled. “This is your doing,” said Hera to Echo. “You kept talking to let them escape. And I shall 
punish you for that. You shall never be able to speak first, but shall only be able to repeat what others 
say. You shall always have the last word.”
 Soon after that, Echo fell in love with a handsome young hunter named Narcissus. She 
followed him through the woods, hoping to make him notice her. But she could not speak first and 
had to wait for him to speak to her.
 One day her chance came. Narcissus became separated from his friends and called out, 
“Is anyone here?” “Here,” called Echo. Narcissus could not see her, for she was behind a bush. He 
shouted, “Come,” thinking she was one of his companions, and she called back, “Come.”
 “Let us be together,” called Narcissus, for he could not see anybody. “Let us be together,” 
called Echo, and she ran up to him with her arms open, ready to embrace him. But Narcissus said 
cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.” “Have power 
over me,” said Echo pleadingly, but Narcissus bounded away, leaving Echo alone and ashamed. 
Afterward she lived in a cave, and finally, because of her great grief, she shrank to nothing. The only 
thing left of her was her voice, which echoed through the mountains, repeating the words of anyone 
who called.
1.The ancient Greeks believed that their gods acted like ordinary people and even experienced 
human emotions. Consider Hera’s feelings and actions in the highlighted part. In what ways is she 
like a human being? (highlighted part: Hera’s wrath.One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.)
2. Based in the highlighted part, it shows how Narcissus react to Echo. How is the highlighted 
part important in the story? (highlighted part: But Narcissus said cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.”)
3.This myth tell us about unrequited love. If you were Echo how would you handle the 
situation?
4.Some myths attempt to explain how something in the world came to be. What natural 
phenomenon is explained in this myth?
5. If you could change feelings or behavior of someone to be less like Echo or Narcissus, how 
would you change him/her?</a>

                        <p> ANSWERS:</p><p>4. D. Faulty equipment or installations</p><p>5. A. Flammable liquids </p><p>7. D. glow same as before </p><p>8. D. Short circuit </p><p>9. B. Run to the circuit breaker and turn off the main switch </p><p>10. D. If one light goes out, it does not affect the others</p><p>  EXPLANATIONS:</p><p> 4. Loose connectors, faulty installations and poor wiring: substandard wiring can lead to electrical fires and electric shock or even electrical injuries.</p><p>5. Storing carts and combustible items in front/near of electrical panels can cause accidental fires or shock.</p><p>7. If one bulb burns out, it acts as an open circuit. Current does not flow in that branch but it continues to flow in the other branch of the parallel circuit. Hence, the other bulb continues to glow. Also the voltage across other bulb remains the same due to which power delivered to it remains the same so it continues to glow with the same brightness.</p><p>8. The current will flow through the exposed wire and will flow into your body causing cardiac arrest or electric burn and will lead to death. A short circuit will occur when the exposed parts of the electrical wires touch one another.</p><p>9. The first thing you must do is disconnect the power supply or the main switch. Don't even touch the victim until you are sure that the power supply is turned off. </p><p>10.A parallel circuit comprises branches so that the current divides and only part of it flows through any branch. The voltage, or potential difference, across each branch of a parallel circuit is the same, but the currents may vary. Therefore, if one light goes out it doesn't affect the others. </p><p></p><p>I hope this helps, good luck with your studiesʕ•ᴥ•ʔ</p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Officially shopping malls are defined as “one or more buildings forming a complex of shops representing merchandisers, with interconnected walkways enabling visitors to walk from unit to unit.”1 Unofficially, they are the heart and soul of communities, the foundation of retail economies, and a social sanctuary for teenagers everywhere. In recent decades, the concept of the shopping mall, which has its origins in the U.S. and became a full-blown modern retail trend there in the post-WWII years, has proliferated across the globe. The five largest malls in the world now reside in Asia. China’s New South China Mall in Dongguan stands at the top of the heap with 2.9 million square meters of space.</p><p></p><p>Despite its ubiquity, the mall as it’s been conceived for the last half century is at a critical inflection point. A storm of global trends are coming together at the same time to cause malls to change the role they play in people’s lives. No longer are they primarily about shopping. Now, when consumers visit malls, they are looking for experiences that go well beyond traditional shopping.</p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><p></p><p><strong>-</strong><strong> </strong><strong>Rose</strong></p><br />

                            20. ECHO
Echo, a beautiful mountain nymph, was a great talker and always had to have the last word. 
She was a favorite of Artemis, goddess of the hunt. Together they hunted in the woods, swam in 
mountain pools, and caught fish for meals. But Echo’s delightful life was destroyed, all because she 
tried to protect her friends from Hera’s wrath.
 One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that 
her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.
 Echo did not know which nymph was Zeus’s favorite, and so she started a conversation with 
Hera in order to let all the other nymphs escape.” Isn’t it lovely here?” she said. “Yes, indeed,” Hera 
replied, “but I am very busy right now and have no time for talk.”
 “It seems to me you are busy talking,” said Echo, “which is the nicest way to be busy, don’t 
you agree?” She went on and on, and every time Hera tried to get away from her, Echo asked another 
question. By the time Hera got away and ran to the nymphs’ pool, all the nymphs had fled. “This is your doing,” said Hera to Echo. “You kept talking to let them escape. And I shall 
punish you for that. You shall never be able to speak first, but shall only be able to repeat what others 
say. You shall always have the last word.”
 Soon after that, Echo fell in love with a handsome young hunter named Narcissus. She 
followed him through the woods, hoping to make him notice her. But she could not speak first and 
had to wait for him to speak to her.
 One day her chance came. Narcissus became separated from his friends and called out, 
“Is anyone here?” “Here,” called Echo. Narcissus could not see her, for she was behind a bush. He 
shouted, “Come,” thinking she was one of his companions, and she called back, “Come.”
 “Let us be together,” called Narcissus, for he could not see anybody. “Let us be together,” 
called Echo, and she ran up to him with her arms open, ready to embrace him. But Narcissus said 
cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.” “Have power 
over me,” said Echo pleadingly, but Narcissus bounded away, leaving Echo alone and ashamed. 
Afterward she lived in a cave, and finally, because of her great grief, she shrank to nothing. The only 
thing left of her was her voice, which echoed through the mountains, repeating the words of anyone 
who called.
1.The ancient Greeks believed that their gods acted like ordinary people and even experienced 
human emotions. Consider Hera’s feelings and actions in the highlighted part. In what ways is she 
like a human being? (highlighted part: Hera’s wrath.One day Hera came spying on a group of nymphs in the woods. She suspected that her husband, Zeus, was in love with one of them and hoped to find out which one he favored.)
2. Based in the highlighted part, it shows how Narcissus react to Echo. How is the highlighted 
part important in the story? (highlighted part: But Narcissus said cruelly, “Do not touch me. I would rather perish than let you have power over me.”)
3.This myth tell us about unrequited love. If you were Echo how would you handle the 
situation?
4.Some myths attempt to explain how something in the world came to be. What natural 
phenomenon is explained in this myth?
5. If you could change feelings or behavior of someone to be less like Echo or Narcissus, how 
would you change him/her?</h2><br />
