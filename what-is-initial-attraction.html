As whenwe use them for more than a fixed time, they become harmful for us.We use mobile phones for almost everything now. Gone arethe days when we used them for only calling. Now, our lives revolvearound it. They come in use for communicating through voice,messages, and mails. We can also surf the internet using a phone. Mostimportantly, we also click photos and record videos through ourmobile's camera.The phones of this age are known as smartphones. They areno less than a computer and sometimes even more. You can video callpeople using this phone, and also manage your official documents. Youget the chance to use social media and play music through it.Moreover, we see how mobile phones have replacedcomputers and laptops. We carry out all the tasks through mobilephones which we initially did use our computers. We can even makePowerPoint/Video presentations on our phones or use it as a calculatorto ease our work.Note: Write your answers in sentences hereInterestingImportant(attracting your attention and(having serious meaning ormaking you learn about it)worth)Ex.

"Ecology Club Finds Gold in Garbage"
Good morning! This is the Great Discovery Integrated School News Center. For our news: "Ecology Club Members Find Gold in Garbage" A group of students from the Ecology Club of Great Discovery Integrated School in Cavite ventured on a project to protect the environment through waste segregation. This was the result of their overnight stay at the center for Ecologic Living ang Learning (CELL) in Silang,Cavite. The Ecology Club Members aimedto reduce the solid waste generated by students amd maintin the cleanliness of their surroundings. "We want to help lessen the volume of trash in our school."Shane Frias, the club president said. "Through our Club, we will make the GDIS students know the importance of waste segregation,"she further explained. They began the project after talking to the student during the general assembly. The student were made responsible for the segregation in the school canteen and the gym. Thete were trash bags allotted for biodegradable, nonbiodegrable,plastics, and bottles. Club members regularly collected the garbage and sorted them out for disposal. The club earned an initial P8,400.00 and they projected a bigger amount in the future. When ask about what they would do with their money, they said,"We have no idea yet, but we will coordinate with the student coordinating organization for humanitarian projects." "If Mother Earth could speek, probably she would say,"Keep up the goodwork,kids,."Here ends our news for today this is Vincent, reporting from GDIS news center.Good day kids and godbless.

5. In the early stages, should the plant be fully staffed, understaffed, or overstaffed?
6. Will employee retention likely be a problem, and if so, how will this affect the viability of the new plant?</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>The geographic location that is best for the plant in terms of attracting sufficient quantity and quality of labor depends on various factors such as the availability of skilled and unskilled labor, labor cost, transportation facilities, and the prevailing labor laws and regulations in the region.<p></p>Whether the plant manager should come from inside the current managerial ranks or be sought from the outside depends on the skills, experience, and qualifications required for the job, as wellas the company's culture, vision, and strategy. Both internal and external candidates should be considered, and the decision should be based on merit, fit, and potential.<p></p>Staffing should be based not only on the person/job match but also on the person/organization match. This means that the candidate's values, goals, and work style should align with the company's mission, vision, and culture.<p></p>It may make sense to initially staff the plant with a flexible workforce by using temporary employees and then shift over to a core workforce if it looks like the plant will be successful. This strategy can help the company manage risks and costs while testing the market demand and the plant's performance.<p></p>In the early stages, the plant should be appropriately staffed, neither fully staffed nor understaffed nor overstaffed. The staffing levels should be based on the production needs, the available resources, and the expected growth rate.<p></p>Employee retention is likely to be a problem, especially if the plant is located in a highly competitive market or if the working conditions and compensation packages are not attractive enough. The company should develop a comprehensive employee retention strategy that includes competitive wages, benefits, training, and career development opportunities, as well as a positive work environment, employee engagement, and recognition programs. Failure to retain key employees can negatively affect the viability and profitability of the new plant.<br />

                            17. Remember that the two different forces discussed in this lesson are:	Gravity is a force of attraction of two bodies because of their masses.	Friction is a force that opposes movement. It is always opposite to the direction of the motion.Learning Task 6: Study the following situations and answer the question for each. Remember what you have learned about gravity and friction. Write your explanations on your answer sheet.1.	Place a book on top of a table. What keeps the book from falling? How is this possible?2.	Roll a marble on top of a level surface. Make it stop. Slide a light book on top of the same level surface by giving it an initial push. Did the book continue to slide? What is responsible for making the sliding book slow down and eventually stop?3.	Drop a small stone and a piece of paper from the same height at the same time. Observe closely the motion of the stone and the paper as they fall. Which of them reached the ground first? Why did not the other one reach the ground at the same time as the first?4.	What is the importance of friction in our daily life?5.	Why do we need gravity?​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1.Gravity pulls the book down, but it doesn't fall down. Therefore there has to be some force that also pushes the book up.</p><p>2.The book did not continue to slide. Friction is responsible for making the sliding book slow down and eventually stop.</p><p>3.Due to air resistance , the stone will fall faster than the piece of paper
</p><p>
the objects that are more dense, or have more mass, fall at a faster rate than less dense objects, due to this air resistance.
</p><p>4.Friction is what holds your shoe to the ground. The friction present on the ice is very little, this is the reason why it is hard to walk on the slippery surface of the ice. Writing – A frictional force is created when the tip of the pen comes in contact with the surface of the paper.</p><p>5.Gravity is very important to us. We could not live on Earth without it. The sun's gravity keeps Earth in orbit around it, keeping us at a comfortable distance to enjoy the sun's light and warmth. It holds down our atmosphere and the air we need to breathe.</p><p></p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p></p><br />
