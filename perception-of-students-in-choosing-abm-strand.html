                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The Accountancy, Business, and Management Strand—or ABM strand—seeks to prepare the young business leaders of tomorrow. ABM strand paves the way for business-related college degrees. It teaches the basic concepts of financial management, accounting, and corporate operations.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The K-12 program aims to give junior and senior high school students enough time to master skills and absorb basic know-hows for college education or job search. Students of the new system will graduate at the age of 18 and forge their path in their chosen career.</p><p></p><p>Each strand focuses on a specific skill set to provide a better grasp of concepts. The ABM strand highlights business and finance subjects to prepare the students for the business industry. Mainly, it covers these objectives:</p><p></p><p>Acquire basic industry skills.</p><p>As said earlier, the students who can finish the 18-year K-12 program will receive a diploma, which can be used for higher education or job search. Graduates can smoothly advance to college or find jobs, given that they passed the ABM track programs. Hence, the last two years in high school aims to teach everything that would make the graduates ready for job.</p><p></p><p>Adopt the right mindset.</p><p>Aside from the basic skills and knowledge, taking the ABM track courses will help the students develop confidence in doing their projects and tasks. Eventually, they will be able to adopt critical thinking skills and teamwork, which they can carry over once they partake in their chosen careers. Aside from skills, the ABM track programs could help students develop the right mindset.</p><p></p><p>Gain business exposure.</p><p>Being good in one craft takes practice. So, it’s best to shape young business leaders early on through real business exposure. The ABM track engages high school students in business simulation. This may require research projects and other practical courses. Also, the subjects under the ABM track aims to expose them to the different types of situations that business managers face regularly.</p><p></p><p>students using laptops during their ABM strand class</p><p>Advantages of the ABM Strand</p><p>Learn the pros of taking the K-12 ABM strand this school year.

Provides Direct Path to Careers</p><p>One of the goals of K-12 in the Philippines is to lead more students to their chosen careers. Many Filipinos are not able to pursue college due to various reasons. Based on data from the Department of Education (DepEd), close to 4 million students were not able to enroll for the current school year (PNA, 2021). K-12 seeks to bridge this gap through programs that will produce job-ready graduates each year.</p><p></p><p>3. Boosts Interest for Tertiary Learning</p><p>Aside from preparing them for work, the ABM track programs aim to encourage students to advance their learning through college degrees and skill courses.

With the K-12 program, senior high school students could explore arts, science, technical, and sports courses. Through this, they will have a better grasp of their college course choice and a clearer career path view.</p><p></p><p>5.

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>The decision to choose a strand in Senior High School, such as Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM), is often influenced by several factors, which can be traced back to Junior High School. Generally speaking, students' experiences in their Junior High years can significantly impact their perspective in choosing a career pathway. Here are some of the reasons that influence students in selecting the ABM strand:</p><p></p><p>Firstly, students who demonstrate good performance in Mathematics, Economics, and Business-related subjects during Junior High are likely to choose the ABM strand. These subjects provide basic knowledge and skills needed in the strand, making it easy for them to excel in ABM's curriculum and help them prepare for their future business career.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, career awareness activities in Junior High play an essential role in decision-making for the ABM strand. Career talks, workshops, seminars, and counseling sessions provide opportunities for Junior High students to learn more about different careers and industries, including the ABM strand. Exposure to the business industry at this stage can help students solidify their interests in the industry and encourage them to pursue it later on.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, guidance and advice from parents, relatives, and friends who work in the business industry can influence students in choosing the ABM strand. Experience and knowledge from people who work in the industry provide a practical perspective on the profession's challenges and opportunities, which can help students make informed decisions.</p><p></p><p>Another factor that affects students' ABM strand decisions is the availability of learning materials and resources. Junior High institutions that offer comprehensive learning resources that cater to ABM-related subjects can positively impact students' interests in the strand. Accessible materials and a supportive learning environment can enhance students' learning experiences and help them develop their skills in the business industry.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, personal interest and passion are critical factors that influence students' ABM strand decisions. Junior High students who have a natural talent in managing finances or are into entrepreneurship are likely to choose the ABM strand. Such interests and passions can drive them to pursue careers in the business industry.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, Junior High School experiences, such as performance in relevant subjects, career awareness activities, guidance, access to learning materials, and personal interest, play an essential role in influencing students' ABM strand decision. These factors can help students determine if the ABM strand is the right fit for their interests, skills, and career aspirations.</p><p></p><p><strong>Answer: </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Several studies have suggested that there are several reasons that influence incoming junior high school students in choosing the Accountancy, Business, and Management (ABM) strand. Below are some of the factors that may affect their decision:</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>1. Interest and Aptitude: A student's interest and aptitude may play a significant role in their decision to choose the ABM strand. Some students prefer working with numbers, enjoy problem-solving, or have an interest in entrepreneurial activities. They see the ABM strand as a means of exploring their interests and developing their skills to be successful in the business world.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>2. Family Influence: Family background and values may also influence a student's decision to select the ABM strand. Parents who work in the corporate world or who own businesses may encourage their children to pursue a career in accounting, finance, or management. Family members may also provide guidance based on their experiences or the current job market.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. Future Career Opportunities: Students may also consider future career opportunities when choosing the ABM strand. They recognize that the ABM strand provides a solid foundation for pursuing higher education in business management, accounting, finance, and entrepreneurship. This will prepare them for careers in industries such as banking, accounting, or investment.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>4. Peer Influence: Peer pressure and social identity may also affect a student's decision to pursue the ABM strand. Friends, classmates, or seniors who do well in the ABM strand may inspire them to choose the same course. Additionally, they may be influenced by the perceived status associated with the ABM strand.</strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p></p><br />
