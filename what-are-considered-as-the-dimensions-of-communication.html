Communication is the process of sending and receiving messages through verbal or nonverbal means 2. Society cannot function without communication, whether it is face-to-face conversation across a dinner table or video conferencing across international boundaries 3. Communication is said to be "the creation and exchange of meaning." 4. Communication is an intricate process of sharing ideas, thoughts, and information True 5. The earliest model of communication was developed by Aristotle. True 6. Communication is stirring up ideas in the mind of another, sharing of ideas among group of people. 7. Aristotle was a teacher of rhetoric and even put up an academy to produce good speakers 8. Claude Shannon and Warren Weaver model gave us the concept of noise 9. William Schramm is the Father of Mass Communication 10. Schramm asserts that communication can take place if and only if there is overlap between the Field of Experience of the Speaker and the Field of Experience of the Listener 11. Eugene White contributed the concept of Feedback to the field of communication 12. Channels are the means by which the message is sent. 13. Shannon and Weaver assert that the Message sent by the Source (Speaker) is not necessarily the Message received by the Destination (listener) 14. Feedback is the perception by the speaker about the response of the listener 15. Listener is the one who receives the message 16. Message is what needs to be delivered or imparted to somebody else 17. The response is the only way the speaker knows that the Message has been received 18. There are only five channels: ears, eyes, skin, mouth and nose. 19. A listener may respond to the Message positively or negatively, 20. The listener is the one who makes sense of what is said and reacts to it by clapping, nodding the head, replying, asking a return question, following the speaker, falling asleep or walking out 21. Miscommunication is brought about by the lack of awareness of the dimensions of communication especially those influenced by culture and gender. 22. Noise is considered as a barrier in communication.​</a>

Anxiety. It is not unusual to experience some level of discomfort in communicating with individuals from other cultures or co-cultures. </strong></p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>3. </strong>Cultural perception is how an individual's culture affects the way he or she's see the world. Since culture informs all areas of life (including the arts, thought, religion, language, food, etc.), perception (how they see the world) is significantly impacted by culture.</p><p></p><p>4. The concept originates from the German word Weltanschauung (“world perception” or “world view”). As a fundamental cognitive construct, intercultural worldview shapes how a culture interprets events and influences intercultural communication and cultural behaviors, a point illustrated throughout this entry.</p><p></p><p>5. The interpretive approach studies culture from the perspective of members of the cultures being studied rather than through a framework imposed by the researcher. Researchers using the interpretive approach are interested in describing culture, not in predicting behavior.</p><br />
