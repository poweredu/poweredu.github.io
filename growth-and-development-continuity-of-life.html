"I can help communicate,give therapy and provide social stimulation, even in difficult situations,"Sophia says on Hong Kong lab tour.This modernization of massive creation of development creates hope, pasting a long term effectduring and in post pandemic times, also Hanson believes that aside from healthcare institutions humanoidrobots can also be part of different industries like retails and airlines which will totally be with.The growth of technological industries now in pandemic era boost improvement on differentinventions like these robots, whereas humans can live with the advance products of technology.Modern-day innovations prove that human intelligence has a wide variety of concepts, upholdinginto a conclusion of passing it as an artificial intelligence that will sold soon as it starts.QUESTIONSWhat is the text all about?

As a broad discipline, biologists use the term unifying themes where the study is being anchored. The major unifying themes that were mentioned include the cell theory as a description of living systems, continuity of life as explained by the molecular basis of inheritance, the interdependence of structure and function, the diversity of life brought by evolution, unity of living systems as explained by evolutionary conservations, and emergent properties that arise from the organization of life.

As a broad discipline, biologists use the term unifying themes where the study is being anchored. The major unifying themes that were mentioned include the cell theory as a description of living systems, continuity of life as explained by the molecular basis of inheritance, the interdependence of structure and function, the diversity of life brought by evolution, unity of living systems as explained by evolutionary conservations, and emergent properties that arise from the organization of life.

                        UNIFYING THEME: FOUNDATION IN THE STUDY OF BIOLOGY<p>1. <strong>Growth and development continuity of Life</strong></p><p>                Life is a continuous process, together with this, all living things will grow and develop continuously through time. Life ends, life starts, hence life is a cycle. </p><p>                Humans will grow in many aspects -- physically, mentally, emotionally, and spiritually. As we, humans are growing we are also developing. When humans mature, we develop lot of things, in physical aspect, the development involve changes in our body, motor skills, and senses. Mental skills or cognitive growth involves our ability to learn, our memories, thinking, and reasoning. As we are continuing to grow, there are also development or changes in our emotions, the way we act to our experiences, and on how we handle and interpret different feelings.</p><p>                  All living things, not only us humans are growing and developing. Plants and animals also, even bacteria and viruses are evolving. Because that's how life is -- through reproduction and death, life will come and go, will grow and develop and will eventually die, but the continuity of life will never end, as it is passed through one generation to another. </p><p></p><p>2. <strong>Organization of life acquire and process energy​</strong></p><p><strong>                  </strong>All processes require and process energy. A give and take relationship. Life needs energy to survive, and gives off energy to help others to live. These life processes are done and needed by different life organizations, from cells, organs, organisms, human, animals, plants, ecosystems, communities, and the whole biosphere. </p><p>                  The most obvious explanation or example on how life organization acquire and process energy is the process of respiration. Cellular respiration is the process by which organisms, for example, us humans, use oxygen to break down food molecules to get chemical energy for cell functions, carbon dioxide is released in this process and it is needed to process plant's food through photosynthesis. Photosynthesis acquires light energy from the sun and transform it to chemical energy. These two processes that involve different organization of life are working together in order to survive, thus, they acquire and process energy altogether.</p><p></p><p><strong>#BRAINLYEVERYDAY</strong></p><br />

                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p>Human development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception)."Fertilization is a sequence of events that begins with the contact of a sperm (spermatozoon) with a secondary oocyte (ovum) and ends with the fusion of their pronuclei (the haploid nuclei of the sperm and ovum) and the mingling of their chromosomes to form a new cell. This fertilized ovum, known as a zygote, is a large diploid cell that is the beginning, or primordium, of a human being."<p></p>[Moore, Keith L. Essentials of Human Embryology. Toronto: B.C.
