In this lesson, we focused on sharing experiences and knowledge in
research. It is important to remember that:
• Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict,
and control the observed phenomenon.
• Research allows a student to pursue interests, to learn
something new, to hone problem-solving skills and to challenge
one's self in new ways.
Reasons in conducting research includes: 1.) Gain hands-on
experience completing a research project; 2.) Work closely with
peers, other researchers and teachers; 3.)
Hone leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate with
others; 4.) Learn valuable lessons for life and class; 5.) Gain a
deeper understanding of the scientific process; and 6.) Have the
opportunity to discover new knowledge and expand about what
you already know
Some purposes of research are: 1.) To advance some area of
scientific knowledge or to undercut some other area of scientific
knowledge; 2.) It is exciting, cool, or even beneficial for
humanity; 3.) Because you like the people in the community of
researchers and want to be with them; 4.) To get knowledge and
experience to be a better student; and 5.) To make a name in
school
Some of the benefits of research are: 1.) Enhances knowledge;
2.) Clarifies confusion; 3.) To have a proper understanding of the
subject; 4.) To learn about the methods and issues; 5.)
Understand the published work; 6.) Learn to create a balance
between collaborative and individual work; 7.) To know the
interest; 8.) To know how the original study originated; and 9.)
Understanding the rationale.

In this lesson, we focused on sharing experiences and knowledge in
research. It is important to remember that:
• Research is a systematic inquiry to describe, explain, predict,
and control the observed phenomenon.
• Research allows a student to pursue interests, to learn
something new, to hone problem-solving skills and to challenge
one's self in new ways.
Reasons in conducting research includes: 1.) Gain hands-on
experience completing a research project; 2.) Work closely with
peers, other researchers and teachers; 3.)
Hone leadership and teamwork skills as you collaborate with
others; 4.) Learn valuable lessons for life and class; 5.) Gain a
deeper understanding of the scientific process; and 6.) Have the
opportunity to discover new knowledge and expand about what
you already know
Some purposes of research are: 1.) To advance some area of
scientific knowledge or to undercut some other area of scientific
knowledge; 2.) It is exciting, cool, or even beneficial for
humanity; 3.) Because you like the people in the community of
researchers and want to be with them; 4.) To get knowledge and
experience to be a better student; and 5.) To make a name in
school
Some of the benefits of research are: 1.) Enhances knowledge;
2.) Clarifies confusion; 3.) To have a proper understanding of the
subject; 4.) To learn about the methods and issues; 5.)
Understand the published work; 6.) Learn to create a balance
between collaborative and individual work; 7.) To know the
interest; 8.) To know how the original study originated; and 9.)
Understanding the rationale.
