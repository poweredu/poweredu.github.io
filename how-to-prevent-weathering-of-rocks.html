                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>1. <strong>D. Weathering</strong> - Weathering is the breaking down or dissolving of rocks and minerals on Earths surface. Once a rock has been broken down, a process called erosion transports the bits of rock and minerals away. Water, acids, salt, plants, animals, and changes in temperature are all agents of weathering and erosion<br />2. <strong>A. Chemical</strong> - Chemical weathering involves the interaction of rock with mineral solutions (chemicals) to change the composition of rocks. In this process, water interacts with minerals to create various chemical reactions and transform the rocks<br />3. <strong>D. Quarrying</strong> - Quarrying is the process of removing rock, sand, gravel or other minerals from the ground in order to use them to produce materials for construction or other uses<br />4. <strong>B. Burrowing</strong> animals such as badgers and moles can break up rock underground or bring it to the surface, where it is exposed to other weathering forces<br />5. <strong>B. Inorganic acids</strong> - Several factors cause chemical weathering. These factors include water, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and organisms that are living on Earth. These factors cause elements to break down and dissolve or create new materials<br />6. <strong>A. Oxidation</strong> - Rusting is an oxidation reaction. The iron reacts with water and oxygen to form hydrated iron(III) oxide, which we see as rust. Iron and steel rust when they come into contact with water and oxygen – both are needed for rusting to occur<br />7. <strong>D. Boating and fishing</strong> - Weathering describes the breaking down or dissolving of rocks and minerals on the surface of the Earth. Fishing does not cause weathering because you are not removing rocks.<br />8. <strong>C. - The soil and sand are mixed with water and carried by it - </strong>During a rainstorm, particles from the surrounding land are washed into the river making the water a muddy brown color, indicating water that has higher turbidity values<br />9. <strong>B. Gardening</strong> - Tilling the garden can potentially increase the risk of soil erosion. Through the use of mulches and weed fabric or plastic, you can protect against the impact of hard rains and soil erosion<br />10.<strong> B. Rip rapping</strong> - Riprap, also known as rip rap, rip-rap, shot rock, rock armour or rubble, is human-placed rock or other material used to protect shoreline structures against scour and water, wave, or ice erosion</p><p><strong></strong></p><p><strong>Explanation:<br />1.

Plants and animals can be agents of mechanical weathering. The seed of a tree may sprout in soil that has collected in a cracked rock.
