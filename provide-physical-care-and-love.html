Student A: Smith (2000) concludes that personal privacy in their living quarters is the most important factor in nursing home residents' perception of their autonomy. He suggests that the physical environment in the more public places of the building, nor the activities available seem to make much difference. Jones and Johnstone make the claim that the need to control one's environment is a fundamental need of life (2001), and suggest that the approach of most institutions, which is to provide total care, mat be as bad as no care at all. If people have no choices or think that they have none, they become depressed.​</a>

Jones and Johnstone make the claim that the need to control one's environment is a fundamental need of life (2001), and suggest that the approach of most institutions, which is to provide total care, mat be as bad as no care at all.

TEACHERS
teachers nurture children’s learning and give them various experiences to face this challenging world. She molds the child to be a responsible and independent learner. The teacher is the first person from whom a child learns his social skills in school. Teachers make him comfortable and guide him through the early concepts and developmental skills of life. As the child grows and develops mastery in different skills, a teacher becomes a real guide in nurturing his interest and learning to make him more independent.

It drives individuals to consistently think, feel, and behave in specific ways; in essence, it is what makes each individual unique. Over time, these patterns strongly influence personal expectations, perceptions, values, and attitudes.</p><p></p><p>Personality psychology is the study of human personality and how it varies among individuals and populations. Personality has been studied for over 2000 years, beginning with Hippocrates in 370 BCE and spanning through modern theories such as the psychodynamic perspective and trait theory.</p><p></p><p>3.Role models are people who influence others by serving as examples. They are often admired by the people who emulate them. Through their perceived personal qualities, behaviors, or achievements, they can inspire others to strive and develop without providing any direct instruction.</p><p></p><p>Social scientists have shown that much of learning that occurs during childhood is acquired through observation and imitation.</p><p></p><p>For most children, the most important role models are their parents and caregivers, who have a regular presence in their lives.</p><p></p><p>As a parent, it is impossible to not model.

As you’ve learned, the hypothalamus plays an important role in motivated behaviors, and sex is no exception. In fact, lesions to an area of the hypothalamus called the medial preoptic area completely disrupt a male rat’s ability to engage in sexual behavior. Surprisingly, medial preoptic lesions do not change how hard a male rat is willing to work to gain access to a sexually receptive female (Figure 1). This suggests that the ability to engage in sexual behavior and the motivation to do so may be mediated by neural systems distinct from one another.</p><p></p><p>5.the processin of exchanging ideas between the among peoplpeople verbal or non verbal is a communicate</p><br />
