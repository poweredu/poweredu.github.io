                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Social media, which represents the phenomenon of the modern era, has been proven to have a major influence on a person's way of life.

People share events from their lives and personal photos; in other words, they become connected to others through sharing stories and images.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>By considering the matter of ratings of social media that in fact are reflected in the phenomenon of "likes" and "comments," a person who sometimes has more "likes" and "comments" than other people accordingly becomes famous on social media. Apparently, fame on social media has a considerable influence on how a person perceives their status in real life as well.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>The matter of fame has been proven to have an effect on people's lives since the existence of civil society. Usually, fame comes from many</p><p></p><p>areas of one's life, such as politics, social activity, public life in general, and the entertainment industry. It has become to be so that the entertainment industry is the one which provides the most considerable amount of people with fame. Other areas do also claim of making people famous, but what is more important is that in order to be famous a person must be public (Replogle). Fame influences the public status of a person, or in other words, the way other people perceive the person who is considered famous (Brim). Public perception, in turn, influences self perception of a person and raises a person's social status in the eyes of others, and in the eyes of that person as well.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p>By being called "social," the media have a noticeable effect on socializing. However, the real-life image comes to be entirely different. The impact of social media has also proven to depersonalize people in real life, and make them more estranged and alienated from one another. Be that as it may, social media and real-life events are connected because people post</p><p></p><p>things on social media that in fact occur in their lives. Nonetheless, the reality reflected on the screens of cell phones is the reality that comes to be distorted by the very same screen. This way, when a person who becomes famous on social media also happens to be arrogant because of it, it comes to be evident that fame and arrogance at the same time are fake, while also being built on false representation and perception. For this reason, one must claim that fame in social media does not always mean fame in real life. Moreover, fame in real life, even though it becomes fame on social media, always comes first, and this could not be considered as the one that influences a person's life in the first place.</p><p></p><p>All in all, it must be said that fame on social media influences a person's life significantly by changing the status in real life as well. Still, the fame on social media appears to be fake for most of the time, as it is perfected and distributed as the most efficient possible scenarios of reality. The second kind of fame that comes from real life, and is reflected in social media, could not be considered as fame on social media, which influences a person's life.</p><br />

                        <p>Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right that is protected by many laws and international agreements. In recent years, the rise of social media has led to a significant increase in the depth and width of this freedom. Social media platforms have given individuals the ability to express themselves in new and innovative ways, and to reach a global audience. However, with this freedom comes the responsibility to use it in a proper way.</p><p></p><p>The depth of freedom of expression on social media refers to the variety of ways in which individuals can express themselves. Social media platforms allow users to share text, images, videos, and audio, which gives them a vast array of options to express themselves. Users can also create and join groups and communities, which allows them to connect with others who share their interests and perspectives. This depth of freedom allows individuals to express themselves in a unique and personal way, and to connect with others who share their views.</p><p></p><p>The width of freedom of expression on social media refers to the global reach of social media platforms. Social media platforms connect people from all over the world, and allow individuals to express themselves to a global audience. This has led to the creation of global movements and campaigns, which would have been difficult to organize and mobilize without social media. The width of freedom of expression also allows for the spread of information and ideas, which can lead to greater understanding and acceptance of different cultures and perspectives.</p><p></p><p>However, with the increase in freedom of expression on social media, there is also a responsibility to use it in a proper way. The anonymity and accessibility of social media can lead to the spread of hate speech and misinformation. Social media platforms have a responsibility to ensure that their users are using the platform in a proper way, and that they are not spreading hate speech or misinformation. Additionally, individuals have a responsibility to use social media in a responsible and respectful manner, and to be aware of the potential impact of their words and actions on others.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it is important to consider how freedom of expression on social media can be limited in certain countries, where government censorship and surveillance are prevalent. These limitations can have a chilling effect on free speech, and can prevent individuals from expressing themselves freely and openly. It is important for individuals and organizations to be aware of these limitations and to advocate for the protection of freedom of expression in these contexts.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, the depth and width of freedom of expression on social media is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it allows individuals to express themselves in new and innovative ways, and to reach a global audience. On the other hand, it also has the potential to spread hate speech and misinformation. It is important for individuals to use this freedom responsibly, and for social media platforms to take steps to ensure that the platform is being used in a proper way. Additionally, it is important to advocate for the protection of freedom of expression in contexts where it is limited.</p><p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>Freedom of self-expression is a fundamental human right that allows individuals to express their thoughts, opinions, and beliefs freely. Social media platforms have greatly increased the depth and width of this freedom, providing a vast and accessible platform for people to share their voices.</p><p></p><p>However, with great freedom comes great responsibility. The ability to express oneself freely on social media also means that individuals must use this freedom responsibly. This includes not spreading hate speech, misinformation, or engaging in cyberbullying. It also means being mindful of the potential consequences of one's words, as social media posts can have a wide reach and impact.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the anonymity of social media can also lead to a lack of accountability for one's actions. This can lead to a toxic environment in which individuals feel emboldened to say things they would not say in person. Therefore, it is important to use social media in a way that is respectful and considerate of others.</p><p></p><p>In conclusion, social media has greatly expanded the depth and width of freedom of self-expression. However, it is crucial that individuals use this freedom responsibly and with consideration for the impact their words may have on others. By using social media in a proper way, we can ensure that it remains a powerful tool for self-expression and communication.</p><br />

While social media can have many positive effects, it also has some negative effects that should be considered.</p><p></p><p>One of the most obvious effects of social media is its ability to connect people from different parts of the world.
