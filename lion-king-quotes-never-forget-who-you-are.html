                                            “People will forget what you said. People will forget what you did. But people will never forget how you made them feel.” This quote gives a very beautiful message that we should not make someone feel bad in life because how you make them feel is remembered by them for whole life. They may forget your words or action but will never forget how you treated them.​</a>

                                            The Lion and the Mouse Fable Aesop's Fables Once when a Lion was asleep a little Mouse began running up and down upon him; this soon wakened the Lion, who placed his huge paw upon him, and opened his big jaws to swallow him. "Pardon, O King," cried the little Mouse: "forgive me this time, I shall never forget it: who knows but what I may be able to do you a turn some of these days?" The Lion was so tickled at the idea of the Mouse being able to help him, that he lifted his paw and let him go. Sometime after the Lion was caught in a trap, and the hunters who desired to carry him alive to the King, tied him to a tree while they went in search of a wagon to carry him on. Just then the little Mouse happened to pass by and seeing the sad plight in which the Lion was, went up to him and soon gnawed away the ropes that bound the King of the Beasts. "Was I not right?" said the little Mouse.​</a>

                            25. what is meant by this quote by Alan Moore: You wear a mask for so long, you forget who you were beneath it.​</h2><br />
                        <p><strong>Answer:</strong></p><p>You are trying to hide who you are to others and in the long run you forget  the real person, the things you're good at and the things you want to show to others. You get used to the things people perceived who you are. This is an advise to those who want others to make them feel that they belong in a group. This is a warning to those people who fakes their identity just to be accepted by others. It can be in terms of  job application, in relationships to have friends and to make someone stay if your in a commitment. </p><p><strong>Explanation:</strong></p><p>This quote is a reminder to be real and let others accept who you are. </p><p></p><p>#BrainlyFast</p><br />

After reading, answer the questions that follow The Lion and the Mouse Once when a lion, the king of the jungle, was asleep, a little mouse began running up and down on him. This soon awakened the lion, who placed his huge paw on the mouse, and opened his big jaws to swallow him. “Pardon, O King!” cried the little mouse. “Forgive me this time. I shall never repeat it and I shall never forget your kindness. And who knows, I may be able to do you a good turn one of these days!” The lion was so tickled by the idea of the mouse being able to help him that he lifted his paw and let him go. Sometime later, a few hunters captured the lion, and tied him to a tree. After that they went in search of a wagon, to take him to the zoo. Just then the little mouse happened to pass by. On seeing the lion’s plight, he ran up to him and gnawed away the ropes that bound him, the king of the jungle. “Was I not right?” said the little mouse, very happy to help the lion.
